Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every donkey saw a monkey.\n3. A human saw a human that saw a donkey.\n4. Hazel saw a human.\n5. Hazel didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n6. Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 1, we know the universe consists of donkeys, humans, and monkeys, with at least one of each.\n- From point 2, every donkey saw a monkey.\n- From point 3, a human saw a human who saw a donkey. This implies there is a chain of sight: Human A saw Donkey B, and then Human C saw Donkey B.\n- From point 4, Hazel saw a human.\n- From point 5, Hazel didn't chase Alfred, and it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred. This gives us no direct information about the relationships between individuals but confirms that Alfred was not seen by Lewis.\n- From point 6, every monkey chased Hazel if and only if every human chased Hazel. This means both conditions must hold simultaneously or neither must hold.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Every donkey saw every monkey.**\n   - We know every donkey saw a monkey (point 2), but we do not have information that every donkey saw every single monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw a monkey.**\n   - This directly contradicts point 2, so it must be false.\n\n3. **There is a donkey that every monkey saw.**\n   - We know every donkey saw a monkey, but we do not have information that every monkey saw the same donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A donkey saw a monkey.**\n   - Point 2 explicitly states that every donkey saw a monkey, so this statement is true.\n\n5. **A donkey saw every monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, we do not have information that every monkey was seen by the same donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw every monkey.**\n   - Again, similar to statement 3, we do not have information that every monkey was seen by the same donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. A donkey saw a monkey.**\n\nThis is the only statement that can be definitively concluded from the provided information.",

He could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every monkey saw Hazel**:\n   - Since Hazel saw every monkey, it logically follows that every monkey saw Hazel. This statement must be true.\n\n3. **A monkey saw Hazel**:\n   - If Hazel saw every monkey, then at least one monkey (and in fact, every monkey) saw Hazel. This statement must be true.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel**:\n   - Given that Hazel saw every monkey, it is impossible for not all monkeys to have seen her. This statement is false.\n\n5. **No monkeys saw Hazel**:\n   - This directly contradicts the fact that Hazel saw every monkey. This statement is false.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a monkey**:\n   - Since Hazel saw every monkey, she certainly saw at least one monkey. This statement must be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- 2. Every monkey saw Hazel.\n- 3. A monkey saw Hazel.\n- 6.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. There is a donkey that every human kicked.\n3. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. A human saw Lewis and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human kicked a donkey.\n- From statement 2, we know that there is a donkey that every human kicked. This means that for at least one specific donkey, every human kicked it. Therefore, it is true that a human kicked a donkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey kicked a human.\n- The given information does not provide any direct evidence that a donkey kicked a human. It only states that every human kicked a specific donkey. We cannot infer from the given information that a donkey kicked a human.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- The given information only tells us that there is a specific donkey that every human kicked, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- Similar to statement 3, the given information only tells us about a specific donkey, not about every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey kicked every human.\n- Again, similar to statements 3 and 4, the given information only tells us about a specific donkey, not about every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- Since the given information does not provide any evidence that every donkey kicked every human, and we have already established that at least one donkey was kicked by every human, it follows that not all donkeys kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1. A human kicked a donkey.\n6. No donkeys kicked every human.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**1 and 6**.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A human saw a donkey.\n3. Every donkey is happy unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n4. If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.\n5. If Lewis doesn't see Lewis, then Hazel didn't chase Lewis.\n6. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n7. It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **A human saw a donkey** - This means there is at least one instance where a human observed a donkey.\n2. **Every donkey is happy unless not all monkeys saw Hazel** - This implies that for every donkey to be happy, all monkeys must have seen Hazel.\n3. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human** - This is a contradiction and thus impossible. Therefore, Hazel must be a human.\n4. **If Lewis doesn't see Lewis, then Hazel didn't chase Lewis** - This is a conditional statement that doesn't directly help us with the current analysis.\n5. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred** - This means at least one donkey did not chase Alfred.\n6. **It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel** - This means Hazel did not see herself.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **A human saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel is a human, and we know a human saw a donkey, it is possible that the same human who saw the donkey also saw Hazel. However, we cannot definitively conclude this from the given information alone. So, this statement might be true but is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Every human saw Hazel.**\n   - We know Hazel is a human, but there is no information indicating that every human saw Hazel. So, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Hazel saw every human.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that Hazel saw every human. So, this statement is false.\n\n4. **No humans saw Hazel.**\n   - We know Hazel is a human and she did not see herself. However, there is no information stating that no humans saw Hazel. So, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel is a human and did not see herself, it is possible that not all humans saw her. However, we do not have enough information to definitively say that not all humans saw her. So, this statement might be true but is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a human.**\n   - Since Hazel is a human and there is at least one human (Hazel herself) who saw a donkey, it is possible that Hazel saw another human. However, we cannot definitively conclude this from the given information alone. So, this statement might be true but is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the given information, none of the statements can be definitively concluded as true. The only statement that we can infer might be true but is not necessarily true is \"Hazel saw a human,\" but this is not a definitive conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that **none of the statements must be true in this situation**.",

No donkeys are happy or every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From statement 1, we know that the universe consists exclusively of donkeys, humans, and monkeys, with at least one of each.\n- Statement 2 tells us that every human was chased by some donkey.\n- Statements 3 and 4 are logically equivalent because they both assert the same condition: either no donkeys are happy, or every donkey chased Alfred. Let's denote this as \\( P \\): \"No donkeys are happy\" and \\( Q \\): \"Every donkey chased Alfred\". The statements can be rewritten as:\n  - \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either no donkeys are happy, or every donkey chased Alfred).\n\n### Evaluating Each Option:\n1. **Every donkey chased Alfred.**\n   - This would mean \\( Q \\) is true.\n   - If \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\lor Q \\) is also true regardless of whether \\( P \\) is true or false.\n   - However, we need to check if this must be true based on the given information.\n   - Since \\( P \\lor Q \\) is always true, it doesn't necessarily mean \\( Q \\) must be true. It could be that \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This would mean \\( \\neg Q \\).\n   - If \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true (since \\( P \\lor Q \\) is true).\n   - But we cannot conclude from the given information that \\( \\neg Q \\) must be true.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This would mean \\( \\neg Q \\) and \\( P \\) (no donkeys are happy).\n   - If \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true (since \\( P \\lor Q \\) is true).\n   - But we cannot conclude from the given information that \\( \\neg Q \\) must be true.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Alfred chased a donkey.**\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred chasing a donkey.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred's happiness.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred chased every donkey.**\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred chasing any donkeys.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the given statements must be true based on the provided information. \n\n**Final Answer:** None of the statements must be true.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Every donkey chased every human.\n4. Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n5. It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey (i.e., Lewis is a donkey).\n6. No humans are asleep only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n7. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n8. Only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred isn't a human.\n- From statement 4, we know Alfred didn't chase Alfred. Since every donkey chased every human, Alfred cannot be a donkey because if Alfred were a donkey, he would have chased himself, which contradicts the given information.\n- Therefore, Alfred must be a human or a monkey.\n- Since Alfred didn't chase Alfred, and every donkey chased every human, Alfred cannot be a donkey.\n- Thus, Alfred must be a human.\n- **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred is asleep.\n- From statement 8, only donkeys are asleep.\n- We determined that Alfred is a human, so Alfred cannot be asleep.\n- **Statement 2 is false**.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n- From statement 8, only donkeys are asleep.\n- We determined that Alfred is a human, so Alfred cannot be asleep.\n- We also know from statement 5 that Lewis is a donkey.\n- Therefore, Lewis could be asleep, but Alfred is not.\n- **Statement 3 is false**.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred is a human.\n- As discussed above, Alfred is a human.\n- **Statement 4 is true**.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis is asleep.\n- From statement 8, only donkeys are asleep.\n- We know from statement 5 that Lewis is a donkey.\n- Therefore, Lewis could be asleep.\n- However, we do not have enough information to definitively say Lewis is asleep.\n- **Statement 5 is not necessarily true**.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred isn't asleep.\n- From statement 8, only donkeys are asleep.\n- We determined that Alfred is a human.\n- Therefore, Alfred cannot be asleep.\n- **Statement 6 is true**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Alfred isn't a human.\n4. Alfred is a human.\n6. Alfred isn't asleep.\n\nHowever, since \"Alfred is a human\" is contradictory to \"Alfred isn't a human,\" we need to re-evaluate the consistency. The correct consistent statements are:\n\n1. Alfred isn't a human.\n6. Alfred isn't asleep.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**1 and 6 must be true.**",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information step by step and analyze each statement to determine which must be true.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Alfred doesn't see Alfred.\n3. If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if Lewis is a donkey.\n4. A human saw Lewis.\n5. Hazel saw Hazel.\n6. Alfred isn't asleep.\n7. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - From the given information, Alfred isn't asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - We know from the given information that a human saw Lewis. However, we also know that Alfred isn't asleep. The statement \"it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep\" means Alfred is asleep, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred.**\n   - This statement involves conditional logic. Let's break it down:\n     - Premise: Not all humans are asleep.\n     - Conclusion: Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n   - Since Alfred doesn't see Alfred, the second part of the statement (\"only if Alfred saw Alfred\") is vacuously true because the condition \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is always false. However, the first part of the statement requires us to consider whether Alfred doesn't see Lewis when not all humans are asleep. There is no direct information linking Alfred's seeing or not seeing Lewis with the sleep status of humans. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude this statement is true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred doesn't see Lewis. The statement \"or a human is asleep\" must be true for the entire statement to be true. Since there is no direct contradiction to the fact that a human is asleep, and given the structure of the statement, this must be true. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - We know both of these parts are true from the given information. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless a human is asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred doesn't see Lewis. The statement \"unless a human is asleep\" means that if a human is not asleep, Alfred would see Lewis. However, since Alfred doesn't see Lewis, and there is no direct information about the sleep status of humans affecting Alfred's actions, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- 4. Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep.\n- 5. A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**4 and 5 must be true.**",

There is not a donkey that every human chased.\n5. Only donkeys are asleep.\n6. It is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 5, we know that Hazel must be a donkey because only donkeys are asleep.\n- From point 6, since it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep, Hazel is indeed asleep.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Not all humans chased Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel is a donkey, and from point 4, there is no donkey that every human chased, it follows that not all humans chased Hazel. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **Hazel chased a human.**\n   - There is no direct information about whether Hazel (the donkey) chased any humans. The given information does not provide any details about interactions between Hazel and humans. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Every human chased Hazel.**\n   - This directly contradicts the fact that not all humans chased Alfred (point 3). Since Hazel is a donkey and not all humans chased Alfred, it logically follows that not all humans chased Hazel. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n4. **A human chased Hazel.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, there is no direct information about whether any specific human chased Hazel. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Hazel chased every human.**\n   - This is the opposite of what we concluded in statement 3. Since not all humans chased Alfred, and Hazel is a donkey, it is impossible for Hazel to have chased every human. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n6. **No humans chased Hazel.**\n   - As discussed in statement 1, not all humans chased Hazel. This means that some humans did chase Hazel, so this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**1. Not all humans chased Hazel.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Hazel won't run**:\n   - The statement \"not all donkeys will run\" means that some donkeys might run, but not all.

Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Hazel ate**:\n   - As established, only donkeys ate, and since Hazel is not specified as a donkey, she did not eat. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Hazel is a donkey**:\n   - We know Hazel is either a human, a donkey, or a monkey. The fact that only donkeys ate does not provide enough information to conclude that Hazel is specifically a donkey.

Without knowing if Hazel is a donkey, we cannot conclude whether she will run or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n6. **Hazel saw Hazel and only donkeys ate**:\n   - This statement is partially true because Hazel did see herself, but the part about \"only donkeys ate\" is not relevant to the observation of Hazel seeing herself.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Lewis and Alfred will attack.\n3. No donkeys saw Lewis.\n4. Only humans drank.\n5. Every monkey saw Alfred.\n6. It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel (i.e., Lewis sees Hazel).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Hazel will attack.\n- We know from the given information that both Lewis and Alfred will attack.\n- There is no direct information about whether Hazel will attack or not.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred and Hazel will definitely attack together. This statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A monkey saw Alfred only if a donkey saw Lewis.\n- From the given information, no donkeys saw Lewis.\n- Since no donkeys saw Lewis, the condition \"a monkey saw Alfred only if a donkey saw Lewis\" is vacuously true because the antecedent (a donkey saw Lewis) is false.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred won't attack.\n- The given information states that Alfred will attack.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis and Hazel will attack.\n- We know that Lewis will attack, but there is no information about whether Hazel will attack or not.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lewis and Hazel will definitely attack together. This statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: If a monkey saw Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis.\n- From the given information, no donkeys saw Lewis.\n- Since no donkeys saw Lewis, the statement \"if a monkey saw Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis\" is vacuously true because the antecedent (a monkey saw Alfred) can never be true.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys saw Lewis and every monkey saw Alfred.\n- We know from the given information that no donkeys saw Lewis.\n- We also know that every monkey saw Alfred.\n- Therefore, this statement is true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n2. A monkey saw Alfred only if a donkey saw Lewis.\n5. If a monkey saw Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis.\n6. No donkeys saw Lewis and every monkey saw Alfred.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n**Statements 2, 5, and 6 must be true.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n3. No humans are hungry.\n4. If every donkey saw Hazel, then every monkey saw Lewis.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - We know no humans are hungry, but we have no information about whether donkeys or monkeys are hungry. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, we have no information about Alfred's hunger status. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry.**\n   - Since no humans are hungry, the condition \"Hazel isn't hungry\" does not provide any new information about humans seeing Alfred. This statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no humans are hungry.**\n   - The given information states that Alfred doesn't see Hazel. This is independent of the hunger status of humans. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n5. **If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.**\n   - The condition \"no humans are hungry\" is already given. However, since no humans are hungry, the statement \"every human saw Hazel\" is irrelevant because there are no humans who could see Hazel. Thus, this statement is vacuously true because the antecedent (\"no humans are hungry\") is always true, making the entire implication true regardless of the consequent.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel are hungry.**\n   - We know no humans are hungry, but we have no information about Alfred or Hazel's hunger status. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5. If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.**\n\nThis is because the condition \"no humans are hungry\" is always true, making the entire implication true regardless of the truth value of the consequent.",

A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively)**: This means no individual can be more than one of these categories.\n2. **A human saw a human that saw a monkey**: This implies there is a chain of sight where a human saw another human who saw a monkey.\n3. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred and every human saw Alfred**: This tells us that Alfred is seen by all humans, but Hazel did not chase Alfred.\n4. **A human chased Lewis only if every donkey saw Hazel**: This means for a human to chase Lewis, every donkey must have seen Hazel.\n5. **If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey saw Lewis**: This is a conditional statement involving monkeys and Hazel's actions.\n6. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey**: This means Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Alfred saw every human**:\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred seeing other humans. We know every human saw Alfred, but we cannot conclude that Alfred saw every human based on the given information.\n\n2. **Alfred saw a human**:\n   - Since every human saw Alfred, Alfred must have been seen by at least one human.

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred is a donkey**:\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred being a donkey. We only know that Alfred is seen by all humans.

This directly implies:\n  - Alfred won't run (Statement 1 is true).\n  - Alfred will not run, so the condition for monkeys being hungry based on humans seeing Hazel does not apply (Statements 3 and 6 are false because Alfred not running doesn't imply anything about Hazel seeing Alfred or Alfred being hungry).\n\nGiven these deductions, let's evaluate the remaining statements:\n\n- **Statement 2:** Alfred and Hazel will run. This is false because Alfred won't run, and Hazel's running status is not determined by the given information.\n- **Statement 4:** Hazel will run. This is false because no humans will run, and there is no indication that Hazel will run.\n- **Statement 5:** Alfred will run.

Every donkey saw Hazel only if a donkey saw Lewis.\n5. If not all humans chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys saw Lewis.\nThis statement is directly given as true.\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis saw a donkey.\nWe know from Statement 2 that no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, it cannot be true that Lewis saw a donkey. This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.\nFrom Statement 2, we already know that no donkeys saw Lewis. The second part of this statement (\"Lewis isn't a donkey\") is also true because if Lewis were a donkey, he would have seen himself, which contradicts Statement 2. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey saw Lewis.\nThis directly contradicts Statement 2, so it is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis saw every donkey.\nSince no donkeys saw Lewis (Statement 2), it logically follows that Lewis did not see any donkeys. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey saw Lewis.\nThis is the direct negation of Statement 2, so it is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 3: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 3 must be true.**",

Lewis ate and not all donkeys will run.\n4. Hazel didn't chase Hazel and no humans will run.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means we have at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **Not all humans chased Lewis or Hazel doesn't see Alfred.**\n   - This can be rephrased as: If some humans chased Lewis or Hazel, then Alfred sees them. Otherwise, Alfred does not see them.\n   - Since we know there's at least one human, let's consider the implications:\n     - If some humans chased Lewis or Hazel, Alfred must see them.\n     - If no humans chased Lewis or Hazel, Alfred does not see them.\n\n3. **Lewis ate and not all donkeys will run.**\n   - This means that while Lewis ate, not every donkey will run.\n\n4. **Hazel didn't chase Hazel and no humans will run.**\n   - This directly states that no humans will run.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n1. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - We do not have enough information to conclude that both Alfred and Lewis will run. The information about running is limited to donkeys and humans, and we do not have specific details about Alfred or Lewis running.\n\n2. **Alfred will run.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, we do not have enough information to conclude that Alfred will run.\n\n3. **Lewis ate and only humans will run.**\n   - We know Lewis ate, but we also know from the fourth piece of information that no humans will run. Therefore, it cannot be true that only humans will run.\n\n4. **A human will attack and no humans will attack.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\n5. **Lewis ate and no humans will run.**\n   - We know Lewis ate, and from the fourth piece of information, no humans will run. This statement is consistent with the given information.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - We do not have enough information to conclude that both Alfred and Hazel will run.

There is not a human that every human chased.\n5. Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey will attack.\n6.

This means if someone is a human, they kicked Alfred.\n- From point 4, there is no human who was chased by every other human. This implies that for any human \\(H\\), there exists another human \\(H'\\) such that \\(H\\) did not chase \\(H'\\).\n- From point 5, Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey will attack. Since we have no information about a monkey attacking, we can assume Lewis is a donkey.\n- From point 6, a human will attack and Hazel didn't chase herself. This tells us that there is at least one human who will attack, but it does not specify who that human is.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Not all humans kicked Alfred.**\n   - According to point 3, every human kicked Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - Point 6 states that a human will attack, but it does not specify Alfred. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will attack based on the given information.

A human will attack.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\n- This can be rephrased as: \n  - \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow (\\neg D \\leftrightarrow \\neg E) \\)\n  - Where \\( A \\) is \"Alfred won't attack\", \\( D \\) is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\", and \\( E \\) is \"no donkeys ate\".\n\n#### Statement 3: Every monkey ate.\n- This means every monkey is an eater, so \\( E \\) (no donkeys ate) cannot be true because every monkey ate.\n\nGiven \\( E \\) is false, we need to check the condition in Statement 2:\n- Since \\( E \\) is false, the biconditional \\( \\neg D \\leftrightarrow \\neg E \\) simplifies to \\( \\neg D \\) being true (because \\( \\neg E \\) is true).\n- Therefore, not all donkeys saw Hazel (\\( \\neg D \\)) must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A human saw Lewis.\n- This is directly given as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human will attack.\n- This is also directly given as true.\n\n### Evaluating Each Option:\n\n1. **Alfred won't attack.**\n   - From our analysis, since not all donkeys saw Hazel (\\( \\neg D \\)), and this is a necessary condition for Alfred not to attack, Alfred must have attacked. So, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred and Hazel will attack.**\n   - We know Alfred will attack, but we do not have any information about Hazel's actions. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n3. **Every monkey ate and a human saw Lewis.**\n   - Both parts are directly given as true. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - As derived from the conditions, Alfred must have attacked. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis will attack.**\n   - We know Alfred will attack, but we do not have any information about Lewis's actions. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n6. **No humans ate just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - We know a human saw Lewis, so no humans did not eat. Also, we do not have any information about monkeys seeing Lewis. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- **Option 3: Every monkey ate and a human saw Lewis.**\n- **Option 4: Alfred will attack.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**Options 3 and 4 must be true.**",

A human chased a human that chased a donkey.\n5. Alfred chased a donkey.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This statement cannot be true because the given information only states that every monkey chased every donkey, not the other way around. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that a donkey chased every monkey.\n\n2. **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - Since every monkey chased every donkey, it follows that for any specific monkey and donkey, the monkey chased the donkey. Thus, there exists at least one instance where a donkey was chased by a monkey. This statement must be true.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - The given information does not provide any indication that every donkey chased every monkey. It only states that every monkey chased every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n   - This statement is true based on the given information. Since every monkey chased every donkey, it means that for any specific donkey, every monkey chased that donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - As explained in statement 4, every monkey chased every donkey. Therefore, no donkey could have chased every monkey, making this statement false.\n\n6. **Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - The given information only states that every monkey chased every donkey, not the other way around. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that every donkey chased a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 2: A donkey chased a monkey.**\n- **Statement 4: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**Statements 2 and 4 must be true.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every donkey chased a human that chased it.\n4. A monkey kicked a donkey that kicked a donkey.\n5. Every monkey kicked Lewis only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: No donkeys chased a human.\n- From the third piece of information, \"Every donkey chased a human that chased it,\" we know that for every donkey \\(D\\), there exists a human \\(H\\) such that \\(D\\) chased \\(H\\). This means that no donkey can avoid chasing a human; hence, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey chased every human.\n- The third piece of information does not imply that every donkey chased every human. It only states that every donkey chased some human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: There is a donkey that every human chased.\n- The third piece of information does not provide enough information to conclude that there is a single donkey that every human chased. Each donkey chases a specific human, but it doesn't follow that one donkey is chased by all humans. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey chased a human.\n- Since every donkey chases a human (as per the third piece of information), this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys chased every human.\n- As discussed in Statement 2, the third piece of information does not imply that every donkey chased every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey chased every human.\n- Similar to Statement 2, the third piece of information does not support this conclusion. Each donkey chases a specific human, not necessarily every human. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: A donkey chased a human.**\n\nThus, the final answer is **Statement 4**.",

If every monkey kicked Lewis, then Lewis chased Lewis.\n5. If every monkey chased Hazel, then every monkey is asleep only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Every monkey kicked Lewis**:\n   - This means that all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n\n2. **If every monkey kicked Lewis, then Lewis chased Lewis**:\n   - Since every monkey kicked Lewis, it follows that Lewis chased Lewis. Therefore, statement 1 (\"Lewis chased Lewis\") must be true.\n\n3. **If every monkey chased Hazel, then every monkey is asleep only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel**:\n   - We need to consider the condition under which every monkey is asleep. However, we do not have information about whether every monkey chased Hazel. Without additional information, we cannot definitively conclude anything about the sleep status of the monkeys based on this statement alone.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Lewis chased Lewis**: As deduced from point 2, this must be true.\n2. **Alfred isn't asleep**: There is no direct information provided about Alfred's state of being asleep. The given conditions do not provide enough information to determine Alfred's sleep status.\n3. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep**: Again, there is no direct information provided about Alfred or Hazel's sleep status.\n4. **Alfred is asleep**: Similar to statement 3, there is no direct information provided about Alfred's sleep status.\n5. **Lewis didn't chase Lewis**: This contradicts the conclusion from point 2, so this statement must be false.\n6. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep**: There is no direct information provided about either Alfred or Lewis's sleep status.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. **Lewis chased Lewis**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **1.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n### Given Statements:\n1. Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n3. It is not the case that Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n4. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n5. It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. Lewis will run unless every donkey kicked Lewis.\n7. If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all humans kicked Hazel.\n8. If not all donkeys will run, then Lewis won't run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **No donkeys kicked Hazel**:\n   - This means no donkey is responsible for kicking Hazel.\n\n2. **It is not the case that Lewis didn't kick Alfred**:\n   - This implies that Lewis did kick Alfred.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis**:\n   - This means some monkeys did not kick Lewis.\n\n4. **It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey**:\n   - This means Lewis is a donkey.\n\n5. **Lewis will run unless every donkey kicked Lewis**:\n   - Since we know Lewis is a donkey, this statement implies that if every donkey kicked Lewis, he would not run. Otherwise, he will run.\n\n6. **If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all humans kicked Hazel**:\n   - This statement is conditional and doesn't directly affect our current analysis.\n\n7. **If not all donkeys will run, then Lewis won't run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel**:\n   - This is another conditional statement. We need to consider the implications of \"not all donkeys will run.\"\n\n### Deductions:\n- From statement 4, since Lewis is a donkey, and not all monkeys kicked him, we can infer that some monkeys did not kick him.\n- From statement 5, if every donkey kicked Lewis, he wouldn't run. Therefore, for Lewis to run, not all donkeys must have kicked him.\n- From statement 6, if not all donkeys will run, then Lewis won't run only if not all donkeys kicked him. This aligns with our previous deduction.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **Alfred and Lewis will run**:\n   - We know Lewis did kick Alfred, so this could be true, but we need more information about Alfred's status.\n\n2. **Alfred will run**:\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred running based on the given statements.\n\n3. **Hazel kicked Lewis**:\n   - There is no information suggesting Hazel kicked Lewis.\n\n4. **Lewis kicked Hazel**:\n   - There is no information suggesting Lewis kicked Hazel.\n\n5. **Lewis didn't kick Hazel**:\n   - There is no information suggesting Lewis didn't kick Hazel.\n\n6. **Hazel didn't kick Lewis**:\n   - There is no information suggesting Hazel didn't kick Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the information provided, the only statement that must be true based on the logical deductions is:\n\n- **Lewis will run unless every donkey kicked Lewis**, and since not all donkeys kicked him, he will run.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Lewis will run.**\n\nHowever, since the options do not include \"Lewis will run,\" and the closest match is that he will run under certain conditions, the most accurate answer from the given options is:\n\n**None of the statements must be true definitively based on the given information.**\n\nBut if we must choose from the provided options, the closest logical conclusion is:\n\n**1. Alfred and Lewis will run.** (This is the closest to the logical deduction that Lewis will run, though it includes Alfred, who has no direct supporting information.)",

Let's analyze it:\n     - If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel did not chase herself.\n     - This part is straightforward; if every monkey chased Hazel, she would not chase herself.\n     - The second part of the condition states that this happens only if every monkey saw Lewis. This means if every monkey saw Lewis, then Hazel did not chase herself when every monkey chased her.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - There is no direct information about donkeys chasing monkeys. We know monkeys chased donkeys, but we have no information about the reverse. This statement cannot be determined as true from the given information.\n\n2. **A monkey chased a donkey.**\n   - This is directly stated in the second piece of information. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - There is no information provided that every donkey chased a monkey. This statement cannot be determined as true from the given information.\n\n4. **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, there is no information that suggests every donkey chased every monkey. This statement cannot be determined as true from the given information.\n\n5. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - Again, there is no information that supports this statement. This statement cannot be determined as true from the given information.\n\n6. **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - While we do not have explicit information that every donkey chased a monkey, we can infer that since every monkey chased a donkey, and there are donkeys and monkeys, at least one donkey must have chased at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 2: A monkey chased a donkey.\n- Statement 6: A donkey chased a monkey.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a single statement that must be true, and both statements 2 and 6 are logically equivalent based on the given information, we can conclude that:\n\n**The statement that must be true is: \"A monkey chased a donkey.\"**",

If not all donkeys chased Alfred, then at least one human would be happy.\n\n4. **A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry.**\n   - Since no humans saw Alfred, it follows that Hazel must be hungry.\n\nNow let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Hazel is hungry.**\n   - From point 4, we know that since no humans saw Alfred, Hazel must be hungry. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n2. **Alfred isn't happy.**\n   - We need to consider two cases for Alfred:\n     - If Alfred is a donkey: Not all donkeys chased Alfred (since Alfred is one of them), so at least one human would be happy. But since no humans saw Alfred, no human can be happy, which means Alfred cannot be a donkey.\n     - If Alfred is a monkey: The condition about happiness does not apply because the statement about happiness is only relevant to humans. Therefore, Alfred being a monkey does not affect the happiness of any human.\n   - Since Alfred cannot be a donkey, Alfred must be a monkey. And since no humans saw Alfred, no human can be happy. Thus, Alfred isn't happy. This statement is true.\n\n3. **Alfred and Hazel are happy.**\n   - As established, Alfred cannot be a donkey, so he must be a monkey. Since no humans saw Alfred, no human can be happy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - As explained above, Alfred cannot be a donkey, so he must be a monkey. Since no humans saw Alfred, no human can be happy. Therefore, Alfred is not happy. This statement is false.\n\n5. **Hazel isn't hungry.**\n   - From point 4, we know that Hazel must be hungry. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Hazel is happy.**\n   - From point 4, we know that Hazel must be hungry. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statements that must be true are 1 and 2.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey saw a human that saw it.\n3. Alfred drank unless every human saw Hazel.\n4. A monkey is hungry and Lewis isn't happy.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 1, we know the universe consists of donkeys, humans, and monkeys, with at least one of each.\n- Point 2 implies that for every monkey, there exists at least one human who saw it, and that human saw the monkey.\n- Point 3 can be rephrased as: Alfred drank only if every human saw Hazel. This means if Alfred did not drink, then not all humans saw Hazel.\n- Point 4 tells us that a monkey is hungry and Lewis isn't happy. This doesn't directly affect the logical structure but provides additional context.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **A human saw every monkey.**\n   - We know every monkey saw a human that saw it, but this does not necessarily mean every human saw every monkey. It could be that different humans saw different monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every human saw a monkey.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, while every monkey saw a human that saw it, it does not imply that every human saw a monkey. Therefore, this statement is also not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every human saw every monkey.**\n   - This is a stronger claim than the previous two. Again, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that every human saw every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No humans saw a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every monkey saw a human that saw it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A human saw a monkey.**\n   - Since every monkey saw a human that saw it, it must be true that at least one human saw at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **No humans saw every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because it is possible that some humans saw all the monkeys. The given information does not preclude this possibility. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5.

In other words, there exists at least one human who did not chase at least one monkey, or there exists at least one monkey that was not chased by every human.\n\n3. **Lewis chased every monkey.**\n   - This means that Lewis is a human who chased all the monkeys. Since no humans chased every monkey, this statement directly contradicts the second point unless we interpret it as an exception to the general rule. However, for the sake of logical consistency, let's assume this is a specific case where Lewis is indeed a human who chased all the monkeys.\n\n4. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel ate.**\n   - This can be rephrased as: If Hazel is not a human, then Hazel ate. The contrapositive of this statement is: If Hazel did not eat, then Hazel is a human.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Lewis is a human.**\n   - From the third piece of information, we know that Lewis chased every monkey. Given that no humans chased every monkey, this statement cannot be true based on the direct interpretation of the given conditions. However, since the problem states \"Lewis chased every monkey,\" we must consider this as a specific case. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Lewis didn't eat.**\n   - There is no direct information about whether Lewis ate or not. The fact that Lewis chased every monkey does not provide any information about his eating habits. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis ate.**\n   - Similarly, there is no direct information about whether Lewis ate or not. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Lewis isn't a human.**\n   - As established, the statement that Lewis is a human must be true. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Hazel ate.**\n   - We need to consider the condition about Hazel. If Hazel is not a human, then Hazel must have eaten. However, without additional information, we cannot definitively say that Hazel is not a human. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel ate based solely on the given information.\n\n6. **Lewis and Hazel ate.**\n   - There is no direct information about Hazel's eating habits. Even if we assume Hazel is not a human (which would imply she ate), we still do not have enough information to conclude that both Lewis and Hazel ate.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**1.

Not all humans will run.\n6. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"A monkey kicked Lewis or not all monkeys saw Hazel.\"\n- From point 2, we know \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" This directly implies the first part of the statement (\"A monkey kicked Lewis\" is false).\n- The second part of the statement is \"not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" Since we have no direct information about whether all monkeys saw Hazel or not, this part could be either true or false.\n- Therefore, the statement \"A monkey kicked Lewis or not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is true because the first part is false, making the entire disjunction true regardless of the second part.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel and every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n- From point 6, we know \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" However, this does not give us any information about whether Hazel sees herself or not.\n- From point 2, we know \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" which contradicts the second part of the statement.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n- From point 2, we know \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" so the first part is true.\n- From point 6, we know \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel,\" so the second part is false.\n- Therefore, the statement as a whole is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n- From point 2, we know \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" so the first part is true.\n- From point 6, we know \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel,\" so the second part is true.\n- Therefore, the statement as a whole is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\"\n- From point 6, we know \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel,\" but this does not give us any information about whether Hazel sees herself or not.\n- From point 2, we know \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" so the second part is true.\n- Therefore, the statement can only be true if Hazel doesn't see herself, which we cannot confirm from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Hazel saw Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\"\n- From point 6, we know \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel,\" so the first part is false.\n- From point 2, we know \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" so the second part is true.\n- Therefore, the statement as a whole is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n\n1. \"A monkey kicked Lewis or not all monkeys saw Hazel.\"\n4. \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n\nThus, the final answer is that statements 1 and 4 must be true.",

However, since there must be at least one human and one monkey, and we know that no humans will run, it is possible for humans and monkeys to be awake.

This statement could be true, but we need to check further.\n\n4. **A donkey is asleep**: We know that Lewis is a donkey and is asleep. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Every donkey is asleep**: We know that Lewis is a donkey and is asleep, but we do not have information about whether all other donkeys are asleep. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred will run**: The information provided does not give us any indication that Alfred will run. The only information we have about Alfred is that he is asleep and that a donkey kicked Hazel if he is asleep.

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys saw every human.\n- This statement is contradictory because it says \"no donkeys saw every human,\" but we know from the given information that \"every donkey saw every human.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a donkey that every human saw.\n- Since every donkey saw every human, it follows that for any donkey \\(D\\), every human \\(H\\) saw \\(D\\). Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.\n- As explained in Statement 3, this statement is contradictory.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A monkey chased Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n3. Every donkey chased Alfred unless every donkey kicked Lewis.\n4. Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n5. Not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\n6. No humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means we have at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **A monkey chased Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - There is at least one monkey that chased Alfred and another monkey that kicked Alfred.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased Alfred unless every donkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - If every donkey kicked Lewis, then not every donkey chased Alfred. Otherwise, every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n4. **Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.**\n   - This implies that if Alfred did kick Hazel, then Lewis did not chase Lewis. Conversely, if Lewis chased Lewis, then Alfred did not kick Hazel.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This means:\n     - If every monkey chased Hazel, then not all donkeys drank.\n     - If not all donkeys drank, then every monkey chased Hazel.\n\n6. **No humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This means:\n     - If every monkey chased Hazel, then no humans are hungry.\n     - If no humans are hungry, then every monkey chased Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n1. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred and Lewis drank. The given conditions do not specify their drinking habits directly.\n\n2. **No humans are hungry unless only donkeys drank.**\n   - From condition 6, we know that no humans are hungry if every monkey chased Hazel. However, it does not specify what happens if only donkeys drank. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded from the given information.\n\n3. **No humans are hungry or only donkeys drank.**\n   - This statement is logically equivalent to \"If no humans are hungry, then only donkeys drank.\" From condition 6, we know that no humans are hungry if every monkey chased Hazel. But we do not have information about the scenario where only donkeys drank. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys drank just in case no humans are hungry.**\n   - From condition 6, we know that no humans are hungry if every monkey chased Hazel. And from condition 5, we know that not all donkeys drank if every monkey chased Hazel. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Not all humans are hungry and every donkey drank.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether not all humans are hungry or whether every donkey drank. The given conditions do not provide this specific information.\n\n6. **Alfred drank.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred drank. The given conditions do not specify Alfred's drinking habit directly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. Not all donkeys drank just in case no humans are hungry.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **4**.",

If Hazel kicked Alfred, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- From statement 3, we know that \"Every donkey chased a monkey that chased it.\" This means for each donkey, there exists at least one monkey that it chased. However, it does not necessarily mean that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- Again, from statement 3, we know that every donkey chased a monkey that chased it. This directly implies that at least one donkey chased at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys chased a monkey.\n- This contradicts statement 3, which states that every donkey chased a monkey that chased it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- As mentioned earlier, statement 3 only guarantees that every donkey chased at least one monkey, not every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n- The given information does not provide enough detail to conclude that there is a single donkey that every monkey chased. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- This is the negation of statement 4, which we have already determined is not necessarily true. Therefore, this statement is also not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 2: A donkey chased a monkey.**\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 2**",

This statement is true.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts point 4, where it is stated that Hazel saw herself.

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a contradiction because if no donkeys saw Hazel, then \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be true, but it would also imply that all donkeys did not see Hazel, which is a stronger statement than just \"not all.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts point 4, where it is stated that Hazel saw herself. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Hazel saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts point 2, where it is stated that some donkeys did not see Hazel, but it does not necessarily mean that no donkeys saw Hazel.

The given condition only tells us what happens if Hazel is not hungry, but it doesn't provide information about whether some or none of the donkeys will attack when Hazel is hungry.\n\n3. **No donkeys will attack.**\n   - Given that Hazel is hungry, the condition \"If donkeys do attack, then Hazel must be hungry\" becomes irrelevant because Hazel is already known to be hungry. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no donkeys will attack based solely on the given information.\n\n4. **Lewis will attack.**\n   - There is no information provided about Lewis attacking or not. This statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n5. **A donkey will attack.**\n   - Again, there is no direct information that guarantees a donkey will attack. The condition only specifies what happens if they do attack, not that they will.\n\n6. **Every donkey will attack.**\n   - Similar to the previous points, there is no information that guarantees every donkey will attack.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the statements can be definitively concluded as true based on the provided information. However, the closest logical conclusion we can make is that since Hazel is hungry, the condition \"If donkeys do attack, then Hazel must be hungry\" does not apply, and thus we cannot infer anything about donkeys attacking or not attacking.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the statements must be true in this situation.**",

A human chased Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis.\n4. If Lewis won't run, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"A human kicked a donkey that kicked a human.\"\n- This implies a sequence of events where a human kicked a donkey, and that donkey then kicked another human. Let's denote these humans as \\( H_1 \\) and \\( H_2 \\).\n\n#### Statement 3: \"A human chased Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis.\"\n- This means that for a human to chase Lewis, it must be the case that not all humans chased Lewis. Therefore, if all humans chased Lewis, no human would chase Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"If Lewis won't run, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n- This statement is a bit complex. It can be broken down into two parts:\n  - If Lewis won't run, then either not all donkeys kicked Hazel, or no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n  - The contrapositive of this statement is: If all donkeys kicked Hazel and some monkeys kicked Hazel, then Lewis will run.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A human chased Lewis.**\n   - From Statement 3, we know that a human can chase Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis. We need to check if this condition holds.\n   - Since there is at least one of each type (donkey, human, monkey), it is possible that not all humans chased Lewis. However, without additional information, we cannot definitively say that a specific human chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Lewis chased a human.**\n   - There is no direct information about Lewis chasing a human. The only information we have is about humans chasing Lewis. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis chased every human.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, there is no direct information about Lewis chasing every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n   - From Statement 3, this is a necessary condition for a human to chase Lewis. Since we do not have information that all humans chased Lewis, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Every human chased Lewis.**\n   - This directly contradicts Statement 3, which states that a human can chase Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **No humans chased Lewis.**\n   - This would mean that the condition for a human to chase Lewis (not all humans chased Lewis) is not met. However, since we do not have information that all humans chased Lewis, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n\nThis is because the condition for a human to chase Lewis (not all humans chased Lewis) is a necessary part of the logic provided.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Every monkey saw Hazel.\n4. If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if Lewis is hungry.\n5. A monkey is hungry.\n6. It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel is hungry.\n- From point 5, we know a monkey is hungry. However, this does not directly imply that Hazel is hungry. Hazel could be a donkey or a human. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel is hungry based on the given information alone.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis isn't hungry.\n- From point 4, we have the conditional statement: \"If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if Lewis is hungry.\"\n- We need to consider the contrapositive of this statement: \"If Lewis is not hungry, then it is not the case that every monkey saw Lewis.\"\n- Since we know from point 3 that every monkey saw Hazel, and Hazel is not mentioned as being a monkey (we will address this later), we can infer that Lewis is not a monkey. Thus, if Lewis is not a monkey, the condition about monkeys seeing him does not apply directly.\n- However, since we do not have direct information about Lewis being a human or a donkey, and the statement does not provide enough context to definitively say Lewis is not hungry, we cannot conclusively state that Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel isn't a monkey.\n- From point 3, we know every monkey saw Hazel. This means Hazel must be a monkey because if Hazel were a donkey or a human, the statement would not hold true for all monkeys.\n- Therefore, Hazel must be a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 4: Hazel is a monkey.\n- As discussed above, since every monkey saw Hazel and Hazel must be one of the three categories (donkey, human, or monkey), and given that Hazel is not a donkey or a human (as per the analysis of statement 3), Hazel must be a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis and Hazel are hungry.\n- From point 5, we know a monkey is hungry. Since Hazel is a monkey (from statement 4), Hazel is hungry.\n- For Lewis, from point 4, if a human chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if Lewis is hungry. Since we do not have information that a human chased Lewis, we cannot definitively conclude that Lewis is hungry. Therefore, we cannot conclude that both Lewis and Hazel are hungry.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis is hungry.\n- As discussed in the analysis of statement 2, we do not have sufficient information to conclude that Lewis is hungry. The condition about Lewis being hungry depends on whether a human chased him, which is not specified.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 3: Hazel isn't a monkey.**\n\nThis is incorrect based on our detailed analysis. The correct statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 4: Hazel is a monkey.**",

Every human chased every human that chased it.\n6. Every human saw every monkey that saw every donkey.\n7. No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Condition 4: No monkeys saw a monkey.\nThis means no monkey observed another monkey. This implies that if a monkey saw something, it could not have been another monkey.\n\n#### Condition 6: Every human saw every monkey that saw every donkey.\nSince there is at least one donkey, let's denote it as \\(D\\).

Lewis could be a human or a monkey, and neither are mentioned as having eaten.\n   - **False**\n\n6. **A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - We know a human is happy. The condition \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" does not directly relate to whether a human is happy. The happiness of a human is independent of what donkeys did to Alfred based on the given information.\n   - **False**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1. Alfred ate.",

Therefore, this statement must also be true.\n\n3. **No humans saw a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts point 3, so it must be false.\n\n4. **Every human saw every monkey.**\n   - While it is possible that every human saw every monkey, we do not have enough information to conclude this definitively. Point 3 only states that every monkey was seen by at least one human, not necessarily every human.\n\n5. **Every human saw a monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 4, while it is possible, we do not have enough information to conclude this definitively. Point 3 only states that every monkey was seen by at least one human, not necessarily every human.\n\n6. **No humans saw every monkey.**\n   - This is the negation of statement 5. Since we cannot definitively conclude that every human saw every monkey, we also cannot definitively conclude that no humans saw every monkey.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n3. No donkeys chased Lewis.\n4. No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis.\n5. A human will attack and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: No humans chased Lewis.\n- From the given information, we know that no donkeys chased Lewis. However, there is no direct information about whether humans chased Lewis or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no humans chased Lewis based on the given information alone. This statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Not all humans chased Lewis.\n- To determine if this statement must be true, consider the implications of the other statements. If all humans chased Lewis, then the condition \"No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis\" would be violated because it implies that if all humans chased Lewis, some humans would be asleep. Since we know that a human will attack and only donkeys are asleep, and since no donkeys chased Lewis, it means no one is asleep. Thus, not all humans can have chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every human chased Lewis.\n- As discussed above, if every human chased Lewis, it would imply that some humans are asleep, which contradicts the fact that no one is asleep. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis chased a human.\n- There is no information provided about who chased whom. The given conditions do not provide any direct evidence that Lewis chased a human. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human chased Lewis.\n- Similar to the previous statement, there is no direct information indicating that a human chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis chased every human.\n- Again, there is no information provided about who chased whom. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 2: Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n\nThis is the only statement that logically follows from the given conditions without leading to any contradictions.",

This implies that for every donkey, there exists at least one human who kicked it. Therefore, a donkey was indeed kicked by a human. **This statement must be true.**\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- This statement is the negation of \"Every donkey kicked every human.\" Since we know from statement 2 that every human kicked every donkey, it follows that no donkey could have kicked every human. **This statement must be true.**\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- This directly contradicts statement 2. Since we established that every human kicked every donkey, it cannot be true that every donkey kicked every human. **This statement is false.**\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey kicked every human.\n- This is similar to statement 3. Since every human kicked every donkey, it cannot be true that a donkey kicked every human. **This statement is false.**\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- This is consistent with statement 2. Since every human kicked every donkey, it follows that every donkey was kicked by at least one human. **This statement must be true.**\n\n#### Statement 6: There is a donkey that every human kicked.\n- This is also consistent with statement 2.

Every monkey kicked Lewis and a monkey is happy.\n5. If every monkey kicked Lewis, then not all humans kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4, we know that every monkey kicked Lewis and at least one monkey is happy. This means there is at least one monkey who is happy and has kicked Lewis.\n- From point 5, we have a conditional statement: \"If every monkey kicked Lewis, then not all humans kicked Hazel.\" Since every monkey did kick Lewis, the condition \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is true.

So, we can update our list of known facts as follows:\n- Lewis saw Alfred.\n- Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement based on these facts:\n\n1. **Lewis saw Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - We already established that Lewis saw Alfred.\n   - There is no information about whether Lewis sees Hazel or not, so this statement could be true or false. However, since we have no information to confirm or deny whether Lewis sees Hazel, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n2. **Hazel saw Hazel and Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - We know Lewis saw Alfred.\n   - We also know Hazel doesn't see Hazel, so this statement is false.\n\n3. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - We know Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n   - We know Lewis saw Alfred, so \"it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred\" is false.

Therefore, we cannot definitively say Alfred won't attack. This statement might be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Alfred and Hazel will attack**:\n   - For this to be true, Alfred must be asleep, and Hazel must attack. However, we do not have enough information to confirm that Alfred is asleep. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Hazel didn't kick Hazel**:\n   - The statement \"Hazel kicked every monkey\" does not specify that Hazel did not kick herself. Since Hazel is a monkey, she could have kicked herself. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Hazel kicked Hazel**:\n   - As mentioned above, the statement \"Hazel kicked every monkey\" does not exclude the possibility that Hazel kicked herself. Therefore, this statement is also false.\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis will attack**:\n   - We know Hazel is a monkey, so the condition \"If Alfred is asleep, then Hazel will attack\" does not apply here since Hazel is not involved in attacking Alfred. We also do not have any information suggesting that Lewis will attack. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred will attack**:\n   - Similar to the previous points, we do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred is asleep or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Alfred will attack.

The statement does not provide enough information to conclude that Hazel is a donkey, so we cannot definitively say Hazel will run. This statement might be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Hazel saw Hazel and a human will run.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Hazel, so this part is true. However, as discussed, we cannot definitively conclude that a human will run. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Hazel saw Hazel and no humans will run.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Hazel, so this part is true. However, the statement \"no humans will run\" contradicts the given information that not all humans will run (which means some humans will run). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Hazel saw Hazel and only humans will run.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Hazel, so this part is true. However, the statement \"only humans will run\" contradicts the given information that every donkey will run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Hazel, so this part is true. The statement \"not all humans will run\" is consistent with the given information. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nThus, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

The statement \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" implies that Donkey did not see Hazel. However, since Hazel saw Hazel, this part doesn't provide new information about who saw whom directly but confirms Hazel's existence.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - Similarly, since there is only one monkey, let's denote it as Monkey. The statement \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" implies that Monkey did not kick Lewis. The fact that Lewis saw Alfred provides information about who saw whom but does not directly affect the running behavior.\n\n4. **A human saw Lewis and every donkey will run.**\n   - There is only one human, so let's denote it as Human. The statement \"A human saw Lewis\" tells us that Human saw Lewis. The crucial part here is \"every donkey will run.\" Since there is only one donkey (Donkey), it follows that Donkey will run.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the above analysis:\n\n1. **A donkey will run.**\n   - True, because every donkey will run according to the given information.\n\n2. **Alfred will run.**\n   - There is no information provided that suggests Alfred will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys will run.**\n   - False, because every donkey will run, meaning all donkeys will run.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - There is no information provided that suggests either Alfred or Lewis will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n5. **No donkeys will run.**\n   - False, because every donkey will run, meaning some donkeys will run.\n\n6. **Only donkeys will run.**\n   - There is no information provided that suggests only donkeys will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n1. A donkey will run.",

It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Every donkey saw Alfred.**\n   - This means that for every individual that is a donkey, they saw Alfred. Since there is at least one donkey, we can conclude that at least one donkey saw Alfred. However, we cannot definitively say that every single donkey saw Alfred without more information.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys will run.**\n   - This means that some donkeys will not run, but we do not have enough information to determine how many or which ones.\n\n3. **It is not the case that Hazel is a monkey.**\n   - Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a human.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.**\n   - This means that some donkeys did not kick Alfred, but again, we do not have enough information to determine how many or which ones.\n\n5. **Lewis will run or no donkeys are happy.**\n   - This statement does not directly relate to the visibility of Alfred or the actions of the donkeys, so it is less relevant to our current analysis.\n\n6. **It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - This means that Lewis sees Hazel. However, this does not provide direct information about the visibility of Alfred or the actions of the donkeys.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Alfred saw a donkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the given information only states that every donkey saw Alfred, not the other way around. We cannot conclude that Alfred saw a donkey based on the given information.\n\n2. **Alfred saw every donkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because while every donkey saw Alfred, we do not have information indicating that Alfred saw every single donkey.\n\n3. **A donkey saw Alfred.**\n   - This must be true because the given information states that every donkey saw Alfred. Therefore, at least one donkey (and in fact, every donkey) saw Alfred.\n\n4. **Alfred will run.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Alfred will run or not, so this cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This is false because the given information states that every donkey saw Alfred.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This is false because the given information states that every donkey saw Alfred.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3.

We only know that every human saw every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys saw every human.\n- This statement is the negation of Statement 4.

This means that for Alfred (a human) to have drunk, it must be the case that every monkey chased Hazel. However, since we don't have information about whether every monkey chased Hazel, we can only conclude that Alfred drank if every monkey indeed chased Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - This is false because Alfred is a human, and every human drank just in case every monkey chased Hazel. Without additional information, we assume the condition was met, so Alfred drank.\n\n2. **Alfred is happy and no donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This is true based on the given information. Alfred is happy, and no donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n3. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. We know Alfred drank, but we have no information about whether Lewis drank or not. Lewis could be a monkey or another type of entity that doesn't drink.\n\n4. **Alfred drank.**\n   - This is true. As established, Alfred is a human, and every human drank under the given conditions.\n\n5. **Lewis drank.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. Lewis could be a monkey or another type of entity that doesn't drink.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - This is not necessarily true.

Given there is only one human, this human is not hungry.\n\n4. **Every donkey drank.**\n   - There is only one donkey, so the donkey drank.\n\n5. **If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.**\n   - Let's analyze the condition: \"If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n     - This can be rephrased as: \"If Alfred won't attack, then (every monkey kicked Lewis) implies (every human saw Hazel).\"\n     - The contrapositive of this statement is: \"If not every human saw Hazel, then Alfred will attack, or not every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Not all humans saw Alfred.**\n   - This is true because no humans saw Alfred.\n\n2. **A human saw Alfred.**\n   - This is false because no humans saw Alfred.\n\n3. **Alfred saw a human.**\n   - This is false because Alfred did not see any human.\n\n4. **Every human saw Alfred.**\n   - This is false because no humans saw Alfred.\n\n5. **Alfred saw every human.**\n   - This is false because Alfred did not see any human.\n\n6. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - We need to determine if Alfred will attack based on the given conditions. From the fifth piece of information, we know:\n     - If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\n     - Since no humans saw Alfred, Alfred could either attack or not attack. However, the condition about Alfred not attacking and the implications do not force Alfred to attack. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Alfred will attack.\n\nGiven the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**1.

Since we know Lewis is a human, it could be that \\(H_1 = \\text{Lewis}\\) and \\(M_1\\) saw Lewis, who then saw \\(M_1\\).\n\n5. **A monkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - If all monkeys saw Hazel, then a monkey will kick Lewis. If not all monkeys saw Hazel, then a monkey does not kick Lewis. Since we have at least one monkey and one human (Lewis), and since the problem doesn't specify whether Hazel is a monkey or a human, let's assume Hazel is a monkey for simplicity (as the problem doesn't give us more information about Hazel). Therefore, if all monkeys saw Hazel, a monkey would kick Lewis.\n\n6. **Not all humans kicked Alfred just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This means if no monkeys saw Lewis, then not all humans kicked Alfred. Since we know Lewis is a human, and the problem states \"no monkeys saw Lewis,\" it implies that not all humans kicked Alfred. However, this doesn't directly affect our chase relationships between donkeys and monkeys.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the problem only states that every monkey chased every donkey, not the other way around.\n\n2. **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the problem only states that every monkey chased every donkey, not the other way around.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the problem only states that every monkey chased every donkey, not the other way around.\n\n4. **A monkey chased every donkey.**\n   - This is true based on the given information: \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\"\n\n5. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the problem only states that every monkey chased every donkey, not the other way around.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the problem only states that every monkey chased every donkey, so it's possible that some donkeys chased some monkeys.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. If a monkey chased Hazel, then every donkey saw Hazel.\n3. Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.\n4. Hazel saw Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy (which means Lewis is happy).\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Every monkey ate but it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - From point 3, we know \"Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.\" This directly contradicts the first part of this statement (\"Every monkey ate\"). Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - From point 3, we know \"Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.\" This means that if Alfred doesn't see Hazel, it cannot be because not all monkeys ate (since all monkeys ate). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **If a monkey saw Alfred, then Hazel ate.**\n   - There is no direct information linking a monkey seeing Alfred to Hazel eating. The only information we have about Hazel eating is from point 3, which states \"Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.\" This does not imply that if a monkey saw Alfred, Hazel would eat. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A monkey saw Alfred only if Hazel ate.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, there is no direct link between a monkey seeing Alfred and Hazel eating. Therefore, this statement is also not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - From point 3, we know \"Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.\" However, there is no information provided about Hazel seeing Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a monkey ate.**\n   - From point 3, we know \"Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.\" This means that if a monkey ate, Hazel saw Hazel. Therefore, Alfred not seeing Hazel cannot be due to a monkey eating. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the given statements can be conclusively determined to be true based on the provided information.

However, since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there's at least one of each, it's impossible for Lewis not to kick Lewis (because if he didn't, all humans would be asleep, which contradicts the existence of at least one donkey and one monkey).\n\n4. **If no humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Lewis.**\n   - Since we established that Lewis must have kicked Lewis, all humans are asleep. Therefore, this statement does not provide new information about the scenario.\n\n5. **If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - Since all humans are asleep, this condition is never met, so it doesn't affect our analysis.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- From the first two statements, we know that every monkey and every donkey that kicked a monkey (which is every donkey) kicked Lewis.\n- Therefore, every monkey and every donkey that kicked a monkey (every donkey) kicked Lewis.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n1. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.**\n   - False, because every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n2. **No monkeys kicked Lewis.**\n   - False, because every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n3. **Lewis kicked a monkey.**\n   - We do not have any information that directly states this, but it is not necessary for the other conclusions.\n\n4. **A monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - True, because every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n5. **Lewis kicked every monkey.**\n   - We do not have any information that directly states this, but it is not necessary for the other conclusions.\n\n6. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - We do not have any direct information about Alfred's state, but since all humans are asleep, and Alfred could be a human, Alfred is likely asleep, but this is not definitively stated.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n**4. A monkey kicked Lewis.**",

It can be simplified as follows:\n     - If it is not true that all humans are asleep (i.e., at least one human is awake), then for a human to have chased Lewis, it must be the case that Hazel did not chase herself (which is always false since no entity can chase itself). Therefore, the condition \"a human chased Lewis\" cannot be true under these circumstances.\n\n4. **A human saw Lewis and Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - This tells us that there exists a human who saw a donkey named Lewis.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement based on the given information:\n\n1. **A donkey chased a human.**\n   - We know from point 2 that no donkey chased a human.

Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred saw a human.\n- Since every human saw Alfred, it logically follows that Alfred saw at least one human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No humans saw Alfred.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that every human saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A human saw Alfred.\n- This is consistent with the given information that every human saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 4: Alfred saw a human.**\n- **Statement 6: A human saw Alfred.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 4 and 6 must be true.",

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Every human is asleep if and only if a human is asleep**: This statement is a bit tricky. It suggests that for every human to be asleep, there must be at least one human asleep. However, since we know Alfred is awake, not all humans can be asleep. Thus, this statement is false because it implies that if any human is asleep, then all humans must be asleep, which contradicts the fact that Alfred is awake.\n\n3. **A human is asleep**: We know Alfred is awake, so for a human to be asleep, there must be another human who is asleep. However, the information provided does not specify whether any other human is asleep or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say this statement is true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Only humans are asleep**: This statement is too strong. We know Alfred is a human and he is awake, so not all entities can be humans. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Not all humans are asleep**: Since Alfred is awake, it is certain that not all humans are asleep. This statement is true.\n\n6. **Every human is asleep**: As mentioned earlier, Alfred is awake, so it cannot be true that every human is asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5. Not all humans are asleep.**\n\nFinal Answer: 5.

If Alfred is asleep, then every monkey saw Lewis (from point 4). Since Hazel is the only monkey and she is awake, this would mean Lewis was seen by Hazel. However, we have no information that directly contradicts Alfred being asleep based on the given conditions. Therefore, this statement might not necessarily be true, but it doesn't contradict anything either.\n\n2. **Hazel isn't happy.**\n   - From point 2, we know no monkeys are happy. Since Hazel is a monkey, Hazel cannot be happy. This statement is true.\n\n3. **Hazel is happy.**\n   - This is false because Hazel is a monkey and no monkeys are happy.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n   - There is no information provided that suggests Lewis is asleep. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n   - Hazel is awake (point 6), so this statement is false.\n\n6. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - As mentioned earlier, there is no direct contradiction to Alfred being asleep, but we also have no evidence to support it.

Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased a monkey.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given information that a donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, while a donkey chased every monkey, we do not have enough information to conclude that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - This is the opposite of statement 5. Since we do not have enough information to conclude that every donkey chased every monkey, it is possible that no donkey chased every monkey. However, since we know that a donkey chased every monkey, this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**1. A donkey chased a monkey.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **1. A donkey chased a monkey.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all humans are hungry.\n3. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. Hazel will attack only if a donkey kicked Hazel.\n5. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Not all humans are hungry**: This means that at least one human is not hungry.\n2. **No donkeys kicked Hazel**: This directly tells us that the condition for Hazel to attack (a donkey kicking Hazel) is never met.\n3. **Hazel will attack only if a donkey kicked Hazel**: Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, Hazel will never attack.\n4. **If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel**:\n   - We need to consider two cases: \n     - Case 1: Hazel is not hungry.\n     - Case 2: Hazel is hungry.\n\n#### Case 1: Hazel is not hungry\n- If Hazel is not hungry, the condition \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" does not apply because the antecedent (Hazel being hungry) is false. Therefore, this part of the statement does not provide any new information about Alfred.\n\n#### Case 2: Hazel is hungry\n- For the statement \"If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" to be true, we need to ensure that:\n  - Hazel is hungry.\n  - Either no monkeys kicked Hazel, or not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\nSince we know from point 3 that no donkeys kicked Hazel, the condition \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is irrelevant here. Thus, the statement simplifies to:\n- If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\nHowever, since no donkeys kicked Hazel (and thus no donkeys could have kicked Alfred), it follows that not all donkeys kicked Alfred is always true regardless of whether Hazel is hungry or not.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Hazel will never attack because no donkeys kicked her.\n- The statement about Alfred depends on whether Hazel is hungry or not, but since not all donkeys kicked Alfred is always true, Alfred will not attack either.\n\nThus, the correct statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. Hazel won't attack.**\n\nThis is the only statement that can be definitively concluded based on the given conditions.",

Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\n5. Lewis is a donkey.\n6. Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.**\n   - This statement is directly given as part of the information provided. Therefore, it must be true.\n\n2. **A monkey chased a monkey.**\n   - Since every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, and there is at least one monkey, let's denote this monkey as \\( M_1 \\). If \\( M_1 \\) chased another monkey \\( M_2 \\), then \\( M_1 \\) would have to chase \\( M_2 \\) according to the rule. Thus, this statement must also be true.\n\n3. **Every monkey chased a monkey.**\n   - From the previous point, we know that if \\( M_1 \\) chased \\( M_2 \\), then \\( M_1 \\) chased a monkey. However, we cannot definitively say that every single monkey chased a specific monkey without more information. The statement \"every monkey chased a monkey\" implies a universal condition that isn't necessarily met just from the given rules. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true based on the given information.\n\n4. **No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - The statement \"every monkey chased every monkey that chased it\" means that for any two monkeys \\( M_i \\) and \\( M_j \\), if \\( M_i \\) chased \\( M_j \\), then \\( M_i \\) also chased \\( M_i \\). This does not imply that no monkeys chased every monkey. In fact, it suggests that every monkey did chase every monkey that chased it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Every monkey chased every monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, this is a universal claim that isn't necessarily supported by the given information. We only know that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, not that every monkey chased every other monkey universally. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n6. **A monkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This statement is too strong. It claims that a single monkey chased all other monkeys, which is not supported by the given information. The information only states that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, not that a single monkey chased all others. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1. A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\n2. A monkey chased a monkey.\n\nThus, the final answer is: **1 and 2**.",

The information provided does not directly address Alfred's state of being asleep.\n\n2. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - Similarly, we cannot conclude that Alfred is definitely asleep based on the given information.\n\n3. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n   - There is no information provided about Hazel's state of being asleep, so we cannot conclude this.\n\n4. **Lewis is a monkey.**\n   - We have established that there is only one monkey, and it did not kick Lewis. Therefore, Lewis cannot be the monkey because the monkey did not kick itself. Thus, Lewis is not a monkey.\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n   - Again, we do not have enough information to conclude that both Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n\n6. **Lewis isn't a monkey.**\n   - As established, since the single monkey did not kick Lewis, Lewis cannot be the monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement that must be true is:\n6. Lewis isn't a monkey.",

It is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **A human is happy and not all donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - From the given information, we know a human is happy.\n   - We also know that not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Every human is happy and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - The given information only states that \"a human is happy,\" not \"every human is happy.\"\n   - We also know that not all donkeys saw Hazel, which means some donkeys did see Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and every human is happy.**\n   - This is essentially the same as statement 1, just rearranged.\n   - Since we know a human is happy and not all donkeys saw Hazel, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **A human is happy and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - As mentioned before, we know a human is happy.\n   - However, we know that not all donkeys saw Hazel, which means some did see Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Every donkey is happy unless every human saw Hazel.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether every donkey is happy or not.\n   - The condition \"unless every human saw Hazel\" is irrelevant because we do not have enough information to determine the happiness of every donkey.\n   - Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Every donkey is happy or every human saw Hazel.**\n   - Again, there is no information provided about the happiness of every donkey.\n   - The condition \"or every human saw Hazel\" is irrelevant because we do not have enough information to determine if every human saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1. A human is happy and not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n3. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and every human is happy.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a single statement that must be true, and both 1 and 3 are essentially the same with different wording, we can conclude that:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 1 (or equivalently Statement 3) must be true.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every human chased every donkey.\n3. Not all humans chased Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n4. Not all donkeys drank just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every donkey chased every human.\n- From the second piece of information, we know that every human chased every donkey. However, there is no direct information about whether every donkey chased every human. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement must be true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a donkey that every human chased.\n- This is directly supported by the second piece of information, which states that every human chased every donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey chased a human.\n- Since every human chased every donkey, it follows that for any specific human \\(H\\) and donkey \\(D\\), \\(H\\) chased \\(D\\). Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys chased every human.\n- This statement suggests that there is at least one human that no donkey chased. However, since every human chased every donkey, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey chased every human.\n- Similar to Statement 1, there is no direct information supporting this. We only know that every human chased every donkey, not the other way around. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey chased a human.\n- Again, similar to Statement 1, there is no direct information supporting this. We only know that every human chased every donkey, not the other way around. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- **Statement 2**: There is a donkey that every human chased.\n- **Statement 3**: A donkey chased a human.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**Statements 2 and 3 must be true.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every donkey kicked a donkey.\n3. Alfred isn't a human unless every donkey kicked Lewis.\n4. A human chased Hazel only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n5. If Lewis is a donkey, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n6. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n7. Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: No donkeys kicked every donkey.\n- This statement suggests that no single donkey kicked all other donkeys. However, we know from point 2 that \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\" This means that for each donkey, there exists at least one donkey that was kicked by it. It does not necessarily mean that one donkey kicked all others. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily false, but it is not guaranteed to be true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.\n- This would imply that there is a specific donkey that all other donkeys kicked. The information given only states that every donkey kicked a donkey, but it does not specify that there is a single donkey that was kicked by all others. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey kicked a donkey.\n- This is directly stated in the given information as \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked every donkey.\n- This would mean that for any two donkeys \\(D_1\\) and \\(D_2\\), \\(D_1\\) kicked \\(D_2\\) and \\(D_2\\) kicked \\(D_1\\). The given information only states that every donkey kicked *some* donkey, not necessarily every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys kicked a donkey.\n- This contradicts the given information that \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey kicked every donkey.\n- Similar to Statement 2, this would imply that there is a specific donkey that was kicked by all others. The information given only states that every donkey kicked some donkey, not necessarily every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 3: A donkey kicked a donkey.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**Statement 3 must be true.**",

This means that either some donkeys will run or every monkey chased Hazel.\n- Point 6 states: \"Not all humans will run.\" This means that at least one human will not run.\n- Point 7 states: \"Hazel isn't asleep.\" This doesn't directly affect our analysis but confirms that Hazel is awake.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Alfred chased a human.**\n   - We know from point 4 that every human chased Alfred. However, the statement says Alfred chased a human, which is not necessarily true based on the given information. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n2. **Alfred chased every human.**\n   - The information provided does not specify whether Alfred chased every human. It only states that every human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n3. **Not all humans chased Alfred.**\n   - The information provided states that every human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Alfred will run.**\n   - There is no information provided about Alfred running or not running. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n5. **No humans chased Alfred.**\n   - As stated earlier, every human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **A human chased Alfred.**\n   - Since every human chased Alfred, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

No humans ate just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n5. No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.\n6. Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: Not all humans chased Lewis.\n- This means there is at least one human who did not chase Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 3: A human saw Alfred just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- This can be rephrased as: If every human chased Hazel, then a human saw Alfred; and if a human saw Alfred, then every human chased Hazel.\n- Let's denote:\n  - \\( H \\): Every human chased Hazel.\n  - \\( S \\): A human saw Alfred.\n- Therefore, \\( H \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( S \\rightarrow H \\).\n- This implies \\( H \\leftrightarrow S \\). So, either both \\( H \\) and \\( S \\) are true, or both are false.\n\n#### Statement 4: No humans ate just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n- This can be rephrased as: If no humans ate, then not all donkeys chased Alfred; and if not all donkeys chased Alfred, then no humans ate.\n- Let's denote:\n  - \\( E \\): No humans ate.\n  - \\( C \\): Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n- Therefore, \\( E \\leftrightarrow C \\).

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information step by step to determine which of the statements must be true.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. No donkeys kicked every human.\n4. Lewis kicked every human.\n5. Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n6. No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3 and Statement 4:\n- **Statement 3:** No donkeys kicked every human.\n- **Statement 4:** Lewis kicked every human.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that Lewis cannot be a donkey because if Lewis were a donkey, then he would have to kick every human, which contradicts Statement 3. Therefore, **Lewis is not a donkey**.\n\n#### Statement 5:\n- **Statement 5:** Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n\nSince we've established that Lewis is not a donkey, let's consider the second part of Statement 5: \"every donkey kicked Lewis.\" If every donkey kicked Lewis, and since Lewis is not a donkey, it means that the condition \"only donkeys drank\" must be true. This implies that no humans or monkeys drank.\n\n#### Statement 6:\n- **Statement 6:** No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n\nThis statement doesn't directly help us determine who Alfred is, but it does provide a conditional relationship. Since we know Lewis is not a donkey, the condition \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is irrelevant to Lewis chasing himself. However, this doesn't give us new information about Alfred's status as a donkey, human, or monkey.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - We have already deduced this from the contradiction between Statements 3 and 4.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - From our analysis, only donkeys drank, and since Lewis is not a donkey, neither Lewis nor Alfred drank.\n\n3. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - We have already determined that Lewis is not a donkey.\n\n4. **Alfred drank.**\n   - As discussed, only donkeys drank, and Alfred is not a donkey, so Alfred did not drink.\n\n5. **Lewis drank.**\n   - As discussed, only donkeys drank, and Lewis is not a donkey, so Lewis did not drink.\n\n6. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - As discussed, only donkeys drank, and Alfred is not a donkey, so Alfred did not drink.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. **Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **1. Lewis isn't a donkey.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all humans are hungry.\n3. Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n4. If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel is hungry.\n5. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n6. Alfred isn't hungry.\n7. Lewis isn't happy.\n8. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n9. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred is a monkey.\n- From point 8, every monkey chased Alfred. This means Alfred could be a monkey, but it does not necessarily have to be true that Alfred is a monkey. Alfred could also be a donkey or a human. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred is a monkey based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred isn't asleep.\n- There is no direct information about Alfred's sleep status from the given points. We need to check other implications first before concluding anything about Alfred's sleep status.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred isn't a monkey.\n- From point 8, every monkey chased Alfred. Since Alfred didn't chase Alfred (point 3), Alfred cannot be a monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred is asleep.\n- There is no direct information about Alfred's sleep status from the given points. We need to check other implications first before concluding anything about Alfred's sleep status.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n- There is no direct information about Lewis's sleep status from the given points. We need to check other implications first before concluding anything about Lewis's sleep status.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel are asleep.\n- There is no direct information about Hazel's sleep status from the given points. We need to check other implications first before concluding anything about Hazel's sleep status.\n\n### Further Implications:\n- From point 4, if not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel is hungry.\n- From point 5, if Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n- Alfred isn't hungry (point 6).\n- Lewis isn't happy (point 7).\n\nSince Alfred isn't hungry, the condition \"if no humans are hungry\" in point 5 is satisfied. Therefore, if Lewis didn't chase Lewis, a human chased Hazel. However, since Alfred didn't chase Alfred, and Alfred isn't a monkey, Alfred must be either a donkey or a human. If Alfred is a human, and Alfred isn't hungry, then the condition \"a human chased Hazel\" must be true. \n\nGiven that Alfred didn't chase Alfred, and considering the exclusivity of being a donkey, human, or monkey, Alfred must be a human. Since Alfred is a human and not hungry, and considering the implications of the statements, we can infer that Alfred is not asleep because if he were asleep, the conditions would not hold consistently with the given points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n**Alfred isn't a monkey.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**3. Alfred isn't a monkey.**",

However, since we know Alfred is a human, and only humans can chase (implying they can see), this statement does not provide new information about who is asleep or awake.\n\n4. **Only humans are hungry and Hazel isn't asleep.**\n   - Since only humans are hungry, Hazel must be a human and is not asleep.\n\n5. **Only humans are hungry and Hazel is a monkey.**\n   - This statement contradicts the previous point where we established that Hazel is a human. Therefore, there seems to be an inconsistency here, but let's assume the first part is correct for now and re-evaluate based on the given conditions.\n\nGiven the contradiction, let's focus on the consistent parts:\n- Alfred is a human.\n- Hazel is a human and is not asleep.\n- Only humans are hungry.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A monkey is asleep.**\n   - We have no information about whether any monkeys are asleep or not. This cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n2. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - Alfred is a human, and humans are not mentioned as being asleep. This is false.\n\n3. **No monkeys are asleep.**\n   - We have no information about whether any monkeys are asleep or not. This cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys are asleep.**\n   - Similar to the previous two, we have no specific information about the sleep status of monkeys. This cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n5. **Only monkeys are asleep.**\n   - We have no information about the sleep status of any other entities (donkeys or humans). This cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n6. **Every monkey is asleep.**\n   - Again, we have no information about the sleep status of any monkeys. This cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the provided statements can be definitively concluded as true based on the given information. The most accurate conclusion is that none of the statements must be true.\n\n**Final Answer: None of the statements must be true.**",

Let's analyze it further:\n   - If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then the condition \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is equivalent to \"every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Every human saw Hazel**:\n   - From point 4, we know Hazel saw every human. However, this does not necessarily mean that every human saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No humans saw Hazel**:\n   - This directly contradicts point 4, which states that Hazel saw every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all humans saw Hazel**:\n   - Since Hazel saw every human, it follows that all humans saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel**:\n   - From point 4, Hazel saw every human, so Hazel is not a human. The \"if and only if\" part of the statement is true because if Hazel were a human, she would have seen herself, which is not possible under the given conditions. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **A human saw Hazel**:\n   - From point 4, Hazel saw every human, so it is certain that at least one human saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a human**:\n   - From point 4, Hazel saw every human, so this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 4: Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.\n- Statement 5: A human saw Hazel.\n- Statement 6: Hazel saw a human.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**Statements 4, 5, and 6 must be true.**",

Alfred could be a monkey or a human (which we already determined is false). So, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n3. **Lewis is a donkey**:\n   - From point 5, we know that Lewis is either a human or a monkey (but not a donkey). Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey. This statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred isn't a donkey**:\n   - Since Alfred cannot be a human (as shown in statement 1) and there is no indication that Alfred is a donkey, Alfred must be a monkey. Therefore, Alfred is not a donkey. This statement must be true.\n\n5. **Alfred is a human**:\n   - As previously determined, Alfred cannot be a human. This statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1. Alfred isn't a human.\n4.

Every human chased Alfred.\n5. It is not the case that Lewis is happy.\n6. A donkey is happy unless no humans are hungry.\n7. A human saw Alfred if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred is happy.\n- From statement 4, we know that every human chased Alfred.\n- However, there is no direct information about Alfred's happiness based on the given statements. We need more context about Alfred's status as a donkey, human, or monkey, and whether he is happy or not. Since we do not have enough information to determine Alfred's happiness directly from the given statements, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A human chased Alfred.\n- From statement 4, we know that every human chased Alfred. This means that at least one human chased Alfred, making this statement true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred chased a human.\n- There is no information provided that directly states Alfred chased anyone. The only information we have is that every human chased Alfred, but there is no mention of Alfred chasing anyone. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all humans chased Alfred.\n- From statement 4, we know that every human chased Alfred. This means that all humans chased Alfred, so it is not the case that not all humans chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred chased every human.\n- There is no information provided that indicates Alfred chased any humans. The only information we have is that every human chased Alfred, but there is no mention of Alfred chasing anyone. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No humans chased Alfred.\n- From statement 4, we know that every human chased Alfred. This means that some humans chased Alfred, so it is not the case that no humans chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 2: A human chased Alfred.**\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 2**",

The only certainty is that Lewis is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and we cannot definitively say which one based on the given information.\n\n5. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - We do not have enough information to conclude that Lewis is specifically a donkey.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Not all monkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. A human chased a monkey that chased it.\n5. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n6. No humans will attack.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Statement 1: Alfred will attack.**\n  - The information does not provide any direct information about whether Alfred will attack or not. We only know that not all donkeys chased Alfred, but we do not have enough information to conclude that Alfred will attack. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 2: Only humans will attack.**\n  - This statement is too strong. The information states that no humans will attack, but it does not provide any information about other entities (donkeys or monkeys) attacking. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 3: A human will attack.**\n  - Similar to Statement 2, the information explicitly states that no humans will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 4: Every human will attack.**\n  - Again, the information states that no humans will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 5: Alfred and Hazel will attack.**\n  - The information does not provide any direct information about whether Hazel will attack or not. We only know that not all monkeys kicked Hazel, but we do not have enough information to conclude that Hazel will attack. Additionally, as stated earlier, no humans will attack, and there is no information about Alfred attacking. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 6: Not all humans will attack.**\n  - The information explicitly states that no humans will attack. Therefore, this statement is true because it aligns with the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: Not all humans will attack.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 6 must be true.",

No humans chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **No donkeys chased a donkey.**\n   - This means no donkey chased another donkey.\n\n2. **A monkey chased a donkey.**\n   - This confirms that there is at least one instance where a monkey chased a donkey.\n\n3. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - This is a general statement about Alfred but doesn't directly impact the chase dynamics between donkeys, monkeys, and humans.\n\n4. **Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - Since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and Lewis isn't a donkey, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n5. **Every monkey will run or it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - Since we know Lewis isn't a donkey, this statement is always true regardless of whether the monkeys run or not.\n\n6. **No humans chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - This implies that if every monkey did not kick Lewis, then some humans must have chased Hazel. However, since Lewis isn't a donkey, the condition \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is irrelevant here. Therefore, this statement doesn't provide new information about the chase dynamics.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A donkey chased every donkey.**\n   - We know no donkey chased another donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **There is a donkey that every donkey chased.**\n   - We know no donkey chased another donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **A donkey chased a donkey.**\n   - We know no donkey chased another donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased every donkey.**\n   - We know no donkey chased another donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.**\n   - We know no donkey chased another donkey. Therefore, this statement is vacuously true because the premise (a donkey chasing another donkey) is never met.\n\n6. **Every donkey chased a donkey.**\n   - We know no donkey chased another donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. There is a human that every donkey kicked.\n3. Every human chased every donkey that chased every donkey.\n4. No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.\n5. Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n6. No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a monkey ate.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - From condition 2, we know that there is a human that every donkey kicked. However, it does not necessarily mean that every donkey kicked every human. It could be that some donkeys did not kick certain humans. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A donkey kicked every human.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, from condition 2, we know that there is a human that every donkey kicked, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every human. This statement is also not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n   - Again, from condition 2, we know that there is a human that every donkey kicked, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This statement is logically equivalent to saying \"Every human is asleep if and only if at least one human is not asleep.\" This is a tautology because if every human were asleep, then it would be false that not all humans are asleep, and vice versa. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n   - This statement is the negation of statement 2. Since we cannot conclude from the given information that no donkeys kicked every human, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked a human.**\n   - This statement contradicts condition 2, which states that there is a human that every donkey kicked. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**4. Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n\nThis is the only statement that can be definitively concluded as true from the given logical conditions.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\n3. Lewis saw a donkey.\n4. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey saw a donkey.\n- Since every donkey saw every donkey that saw it, and Lewis saw a donkey, if Lewis is a donkey, then a donkey (Lewis) saw a donkey. This statement must be true regardless of whether Lewis is a donkey or not because the condition \"every donkey saw every donkey that saw it\" applies universally among donkeys.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys saw every donkey.\n- The statement \"every donkey saw every donkey that saw it\" implies that each donkey saw all other donkeys that saw it. Therefore, no donkey can see every single donkey, as it would mean seeing itself and all others, which is logically impossible for a single donkey to see all others simultaneously. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey saw every donkey.\n- From the given condition, every donkey saw every donkey that saw it. However, this does not necessarily mean that a donkey saw every single donkey. It means that if a donkey saw another donkey, it also saw that donkey. We cannot conclude that a donkey saw every single donkey without additional information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey saw a donkey.\n- This statement is implied by the condition that every donkey saw every donkey that saw it. If a donkey saw another donkey, it saw a donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey saw every donkey.\n- This is a stronger version of the given condition. While it is true that every donkey saw every donkey that saw it, we cannot conclude that every donkey saw every single donkey without additional information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\n- This is directly stated in the given condition. If a donkey saw another donkey, it saw that donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1. A donkey saw a donkey.\n2. No donkeys saw every donkey.\n4. Every donkey saw a donkey.\n6. A donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n1, 2, 4, 6",

We only know that no donkeys kicked Alfred and no humans kicked Lewis, but this does not imply that they will attack.\n\n6. **Not all humans will attack.**\n   - This is true because no humans will attack, so it is correct to say that not all humans will attack.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all donkeys saw Alfred.\n3. Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\n4. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every donkey.\n- This statement suggests that for every pair of donkeys \\(D_1\\) and \\(D_2\\), \\(D_1\\) kicked \\(D_2\\).\n- From the third piece of information, we know that every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it. However, this does not necessarily mean that every donkey kicked every other donkey. It only means that if \\(D_1\\) kicked \\(D_2\\), then \\(D_2\\) also kicked \\(D_1\\). Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys kicked a donkey.\n- This statement suggests that no donkey kicked any other donkey.\n- The third piece of information states that every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it. This directly contradicts this statement. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every donkey.\n- As discussed above, the third piece of information only guarantees that every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, not that every donkey kicked every other donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.\n- This statement suggests that there exists a donkey \\(D\\) such that every other donkey kicked \\(D\\).\n- The third piece of information does not provide enough information to conclude that there is a single donkey that every other donkey kicked. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey kicked a donkey.\n- This statement suggests that at least one donkey kicked another donkey.\n- The third piece of information states that every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it. This implies that there is at least one instance where a donkey kicked another donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every donkey.\n- This statement suggests that no donkey kicked every other donkey.\n- As discussed earlier, the third piece of information does not guarantee that no donkey kicked every other donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey kicked a donkey.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**Statement 5 must be true.**",

A monkey kicked Alfred.\n6. Every donkey drank.\n7. Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, we know there is at least one monkey, and it is happy.\n- From point 5, we know a monkey kicked Alfred, so Alfred was kicked by a monkey.\n- From point 6, every donkey drank, meaning all donkeys drank.\n- From point 7, only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis. Since every donkey drank, this condition is satisfied.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - We know from point 5 that a monkey kicked Alfred, but this does not provide information about whether Alfred drank or not. The fact that every donkey drank does not necessarily mean Alfred, who could be a human or a monkey, drank. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - We know every donkey drank, but we have no information about Hazel drinking. Hazel could be a human or a monkey, and neither the given conditions nor the specific mention of Hazel drinking can confirm this. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We know every donkey drank, but we have no information about Lewis drinking. Lewis could be a human or a monkey, and neither the given conditions nor the specific mention of Lewis drinking can confirm this. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A monkey is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - This is directly supported by points 3 and 5. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Alfred drank.**\n   - As mentioned earlier, we do not have enough information to conclude that Alfred drank. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - We know a monkey kicked Alfred (point 5), but we have no information about Alfred's happiness. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n4. A human is happy if and only if no donkeys will attack.\n5. No donkeys will attack just in case a human is asleep.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Alfred and Lewis will attack.**\n   - Since Alfred and Lewis are humans and they are asleep, according to the given conditions, no donkeys will attack because a human (Alfred or Lewis) is asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A human is happy just in case a human is asleep.**\n   - From the given conditions, a human is happy if and only if no donkeys will attack, and no donkeys will attack just in case a human is asleep. This means that a human is happy if and only if a human is asleep. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **A human is happy just in case every human is asleep.**\n   - The condition for a human to be happy is that no donkeys will attack, which happens if a human is asleep. However, it does not require that every human must be asleep; it only requires that at least one human is asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - Since Alfred is a human and he is asleep, no donkeys will attack. Therefore, Alfred will not attack. This statement is false.\n\n5. **Alfred won't attack.**\n   - As explained above, since Alfred is asleep, no donkeys will attack, so Alfred will not attack. This statement is true.\n\n6. **A human is happy just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - For a human to be happy, no donkeys will attack, which happens if a human is asleep. If all humans were asleep, then a human would still be asleep, meaning no donkeys would attack, and thus a human would be happy. However, if no humans were asleep, then no donkeys would attack, and a human would still be happy. Therefore, the correct condition is that at least one human must be asleep, not that not all humans are asleep. This statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- 2. A human is happy just in case a human is asleep.\n- 5. Alfred won't attack.\n\nSo, the final answer is: **2 and 5**.",

However, it does not imply that if a donkey saw Lewis, then it must see Hazel. It's a conditional statement.\n\n4. **A monkey kicked Alfred and no humans will attack.**\n   - This means Alfred was kicked by a monkey, and no humans will attack as a result of this event.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - The information provided does not indicate that Alfred will attack. We only know that Alfred was kicked by a monkey, but there is no information about Alfred's reaction or intention to attack. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis will attack.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, there is no information suggesting that Alfred or Lewis will attack. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A human will attack.**\n   - The information explicitly states that \"no humans will attack.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all humans will attack.**\n   - Since no humans will attack, it is true that not all humans will attack. This statement is true.\n\n5. **Every human will attack.**\n   - As stated, no humans will attack, so it cannot be true that every human will attack. This statement is false.\n\n6. **Only humans will attack.**\n   - Since no humans will attack, it is clear that only humans will not attack. This statement is true, but it is redundant because the condition that no humans will attack already implies that only humans will not attack.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **Not all humans will attack.**\n- **Only humans will not attack.**\n\nHowever, since the question asks for which statement must be true, and considering the redundancy, the most directly relevant and unambiguous true statement is:\n\n**Not all humans will attack.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **4.

Every human saw Alfred.\n5. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel (which means Lewis sees Hazel).\n7. Lewis saw Lewis if and only if not all humans kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, no donkeys saw Lewis.\n- From point 5, Lewis sees Hazel.\n- From point 7, we need to consider the condition involving humans kicking Alfred. If not all humans kicked Alfred, then Lewis saw Lewis. However, if all humans did kick Alfred, then Lewis did not see Lewis.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n1. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - This statement is contradictory. It cannot be true because it says both \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" and \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n\n2. **A donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - According to point 3, no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Lewis saw every donkey.**\n   - We know Lewis isn't a donkey (point 5). Since Lewis can't be a donkey, he could potentially see other donkeys. However, the information provided does not give us enough detail to conclude that Lewis saw every donkey. Thus, this statement may or may not be true based on the given information.\n\n4. **No donkeys saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - This statement is a tautology because it reiterates that no donkeys saw Lewis (from point 3) and that Lewis is not a donkey (point 5). Therefore, it is true.\n\n5. **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - This statement is consistent with points 3 and 5. Therefore, it is true.\n\n6. **Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - According to point 3, no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 4: No donkeys saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n- **Statement 5: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\nThus, the final answer is that statements 4 and 5 must be true.",

This means:\n  - If a human saw Hazel, then every donkey chased Lewis.\n  - If every donkey chased Lewis, then a human saw Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n1. **Lewis saw Lewis just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Lewis saw himself or any other entity based on a human seeing Hazel. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true from the given information.\n\n2. **A human saw Lewis and it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - There is no direct information linking a human seeing Lewis with Hazel not seeing herself. Also, the statement about Hazel not seeing herself does not directly relate to the given conditions.

However, there is no direct link between Lewis seeing Hazel and not all humans seeing Hazel. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n4. **A human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel.**\n   - From the given statements, we know that every donkey chased Lewis if and only if a human saw Hazel. Since there are donkeys and humans, and every donkey chasing Lewis implies a human saw Hazel, and vice versa, this statement must be true. If a human saw Hazel, then every donkey chased Lewis, which means Lewis saw Hazel. Conversely, if Lewis saw Hazel, then a human must have seen Hazel for the condition to hold.\n\n5. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - There is no information provided about a human seeing Lewis or the condition of Hazel seeing herself. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n6. **Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - As previously discussed, there is no direct link between Lewis seeing himself and the condition of not all humans seeing Hazel.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: a donkey, a human, and a monkey.\n3. Alfred is a monkey.\n4. Hazel saw Lewis.\n5. If not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\n6. If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\n7. Only donkeys are asleep.\n8. It is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 7, we know that only donkeys are asleep. This means that neither humans nor monkeys are asleep.\n- From point 8, since it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep, Hazel must be asleep. But from point 7, only donkeys are asleep, so Hazel must be a donkey.\n- Since Hazel is a donkey and is asleep, and only donkeys are asleep, no other donkeys can be asleep. Therefore, all donkeys are asleep except Hazel.\n- From point 5, if not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\n- From point 6, if not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\n- Since only donkeys are asleep, all humans are awake. Therefore, no humans are hungry (from point 6).\n\nGiven that no humans are hungry, Lewis must be hungry (from point 6). \n\nNow, let's apply this to the conditions in points 5 and 6:\n- Since no humans are hungry, the condition \"not all humans are asleep\" does not hold because all humans are awake. Thus, the antecedent of both conditional statements (points 5 and 6) is false.\n- A false antecedent makes both conditional statements true regardless of the consequents. So, the statements in points 5 and 6 are true.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **A donkey saw Lewis**: We do not have enough information to conclude this directly. Hazel saw Lewis, but we do not know if Hazel is a donkey.\n2. **Not all donkeys saw Lewis**: We cannot conclude this either. We only know Hazel saw Lewis, but we do not know about other donkeys.\n3. **Lewis saw every donkey**: We do not have information about what Lewis saw.\n4. **No donkeys saw Lewis**: We do not have information to conclude this. Hazel saw Lewis, and Hazel is a donkey.\n5. **Every donkey saw Lewis**: We do not have information to conclude this. Hazel saw Lewis, but we do not know about other donkeys.\n6. **Lewis saw a donkey**: We do not have information to conclude this. The problem does not provide any information about what Lewis saw.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided statements must be true based on the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the statements must be true.**",

So, Alfred is either a donkey or a human.\n- From point 4, every donkey drank. Since Alfred could be a donkey, Alfred might have drunk.\n- From point 5, a monkey is hungry.\n- From point 7, every monkey drank. This means all monkeys drank.\n- From point 8, Lewis is hungry. Since a monkey is hungry (point 5) and every monkey drank (point 7), it implies that at least one monkey is hungry and drank.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Not all monkeys drank.**\n   - This statement is false because point 7 explicitly states that every monkey drank.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - Alfred might have drunk (if he is a donkey), but we do not have enough information to confirm that Lewis drank.

However, since we know there is only one donkey and it did not chase Hazel, this statement does not provide new information directly.\n\n6. **Alfred didn't chase Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement.

Therefore, this statement cannot be true because the donkey did not chase anyone, so it did not kick anyone.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, since the donkey did not chase anyone, this statement is false.\n\n3. **A donkey kicked every human.**\n   - Again, since the donkey did not chase anyone, this statement is false.\n\n4. **A donkey kicked a human.**\n   - As established, the donkey did not chase anyone, so it did not kick anyone.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n### Given Statements:\n1. Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys saw a donkey.\n3. Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey kicked Hazel.\n4. If no humans chased Hazel, then not all humans chased Lewis.\n5. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if every human saw Hazel.\n6. Hazel saw Hazel and every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Hazel saw Hazel**: This means Hazel is a donkey, a human, or a monkey who saw herself. Since everything is exclusively one of these three categories, and Hazel saw herself, Hazel must be a donkey, a human, or a monkey who saw herself. However, since we need to determine which specific category Hazel falls into based on other conditions, we will revisit this after analyzing other statements.\n\n2. **Every monkey chased Alfred**: This means Alfred is a donkey, a human, or a monkey who was chased by every monkey. Since everything is exclusively one of these three categories, Alfred cannot be a monkey because every monkey chased him. Therefore, Alfred must be a donkey or a human.\n\n3. **No donkeys saw a donkey**: This means that if someone is a donkey, they did not see another donkey. This does not directly help us determine the identity of Hazel or Alfred but is useful for consistency checks.\n\n4. **Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey kicked Hazel**: This implies that if a monkey kicked Hazel, Lewis could be a human or a monkey. Without additional information about whether a monkey kicked Hazel, we can't definitively say if Lewis is a donkey or not.\n\n5. **If no humans chased Hazel, then not all humans chased Lewis**: This statement provides a conditional relationship between humans chasing Hazel and Lewis. If no humans chased Hazel, it doesn't necessarily mean that Lewis wasn't chased by all humans, but it does imply that if some humans did chase Hazel, then not all humans chased Lewis.\n\n6. **If every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if every human saw Hazel**: This is a complex conditional statement. It tells us that if every monkey chased Hazel, then for Lewis to be a donkey, every human must have seen Hazel. \n\n### Deductions:\n- From statement 6, if every monkey chased Hazel, then for Lewis to be a donkey, every human must have seen Hazel. However, we know from statement 1 that there is at least one human, so if every human saw Hazel, it would support Lewis being a donkey under this condition.\n- Statement 3 suggests that if a monkey kicked Hazel, Lewis could be a human or a monkey. We need to check if a monkey kicked Hazel to determine Lewis's status.\n- Statement 6 also implies that if every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis being a donkey depends on every human seeing Hazel. Since we know Hazel saw herself (statement 1), it is possible that every human saw Hazel, supporting Lewis being a donkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis, the most consistent and supported statement is:\n- **Lewis is a donkey** (Statement 6 supports this under certain conditions).\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that none of the other statements contradict this conclusion. Since Alfred is a donkey or a human (statement 2), and Hazel is a donkey, human, or monkey who saw herself (statement 1), the only definitive statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer:**\n6. Lewis is a donkey.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Lewis didn't kick Lewis.\n3. Only humans are hungry.\n4. Hazel kicked every human.\n5. No donkeys kicked Hazel and Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n6. Not all monkeys chased Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### Statement 1: If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n- Since only humans are hungry, if Hazel is hungry, it means Hazel is a human.\n- The condition \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be irrelevant because Hazel is a human, and the statement about donkeys kicking Hazel is already given as false (no donkeys kicked Hazel).\n- Therefore, the statement \"If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is always true regardless of whether humans are hungry or not.\n- However, the \"only if no humans are hungry\" part is redundant since Hazel being hungry implies Hazel is a human, and humans can be hungry.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n- From the given information, only humans are hungry.\n- We know Hazel is a human and kicked every human, so Hazel is hungry.\n- We also know Hazel didn't chase Alfred, which doesn't provide direct information about Alfred's status.\n- We know Lewis didn't kick Lewis, which doesn't provide direct information about Lewis's status.\n- Since we have no direct information that Alfred is a human, we cannot conclude that Alfred is hungry.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: If Hazel kicked Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n- As established, Hazel is a human and cannot kick herself.\n- The condition \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" is false.\n- A false antecedent makes the entire implication true regardless of the consequent.\n- Therefore, the statement is true.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred is hungry.\n- As previously discussed, only humans are hungry.\n- We have no direct information that Alfred is a human.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Only humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- This is directly supported by the given information.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- Since only humans are hungry, if not all humans are hungry, it means some humans are not hungry.\n- This is consistent with the given information.\n- No donkeys kicked Hazel is also given.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement must be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n3. If Hazel kicked Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n5. Only humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n6. Not all humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nSo, the final answer is: **1, 3, 5, 6**.",

A human is asleep unless every donkey will attack.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis will attack.\n- We have no direct information about whether Alfred or Lewis will attack. The only information we have is that humans saw Alfred, and a human is asleep unless every donkey will attack. This does not provide enough information to conclude that Alfred or Lewis will attack. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred won't attack.\n- Similar to Statement 1, we do not have any direct information about whether Alfred will attack or not. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred will attack.\n- Again, similar to Statements 1 and 2, we do not have any direct information to conclude that Alfred will attack. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys saw Lewis and every donkey drank.\n- This statement is consistent with the given information. It states that no donkeys saw Lewis, which is directly stated, and it also states that every donkey drank, which is also directly stated. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all donkeys drank.\n- This statement is not supported by the given information. There is no information about what Lewis saw or did not see. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis will attack.\n- We have no direct information about whether Lewis will attack or not. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: No donkeys saw Lewis and every donkey drank.**\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 4 must be true.**",

Since Alfred isn't a human (from statement 4) and everything is either a donkey, human, or monkey, Alfred must be a donkey. Therefore, Alfred will run.

Therefore, every donkey must be happy, making this statement false.\n\n3. **Every donkey is happy.**\n   - As explained above, since every donkey will run and not all donkeys will run cannot be true, every donkey must be happy. This statement must be true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys are happy.**\n   - This directly contradicts the conclusion that every donkey is happy. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - These two statements are mutually exclusive. If not all donkeys will run, then not every donkey will run. But we know from statement 5 that every donkey will run. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n6. **Only donkeys are happy.**\n   - We have established that every donkey is happy.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n3. Every donkey chased Alfred.\n4. Alfred drank unless Alfred isn't a human.\n5. Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, we know that every donkey chased Alfred. This means if there is even one donkey, it chased Alfred.\n- Point 5 states \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\" This implies that if no donkeys chased Alfred, then not all donkeys chased Alfred. However, since every donkey chased Alfred (from point 3), this condition can never be met because it would contradict the fact that every donkey chased Alfred. Therefore, the phrase \"just in case no donkeys chased Alfred\" is essentially irrelevant here as it cannot happen under the given conditions.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This statement contradicts point 3, which says every donkey chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred chased every donkey.**\n   - The given information does not provide any information about Alfred chasing donkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n3. **A donkey chased Alfred.**\n   - Since every donkey chased Alfred (point 3), this statement is true.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This directly contradicts point 3. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Alfred chased a donkey.**\n   - The given information does not provide any information about Alfred chasing donkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Alfred drank.**\n   - According to point 4, Alfred drank unless Alfred isn't a human. Since there is at least one human (point 2), Alfred must be a human. Therefore, Alfred drank. This statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 3: A donkey chased Alfred.**\n- **Statement 6: Alfred drank.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 3 and 6 must be true.",

Only humans are hungry.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### 1. No donkeys kicked Alfred or no humans are hungry.\n- From point 5, we know that only humans are hungry. This means there are no donkeys that are hungry.\n- Since not all donkeys chased Alfred, it doesn't necessarily mean that no donkeys kicked Alfred. It just means that some donkeys did not chase Alfred.\n- Therefore, the statement \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" does not have to be true based on the given information. However, since no humans are hungry, the second part of the statement \"no humans are hungry\" is true.\n- Thus, the entire statement is not necessarily true because the first part (\"No donkeys kicked Alfred\") is not guaranteed to be true.\n\n#### 2. Alfred is hungry.\n- From point 5, only humans are hungry. The statement does not provide any direct information about Alfred being a human. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred is hungry.\n\n#### 3. Alfred isn't hungry.\n- Since only humans are hungry and Alfred could be a donkey or a monkey, Alfred is not necessarily hungry. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### 4. No donkeys kicked Alfred unless no humans are hungry.\n- We already established that only humans are hungry. So, the condition \"no humans are hungry\" is false.\n- If the condition \"no humans are hungry\" is false, then the statement \"no donkeys kicked Alfred\" does not need to be true for the whole statement to hold. However, since not all donkeys chased Alfred, it doesn't necessarily mean that no donkeys kicked Alfred. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### 5. Only humans are hungry and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n- From point 5, only humans are hungry, which is true.\n- We also know from the given information that not all donkeys chased Alfred, and not all donkeys kicked Alfred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### 6. Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n- As established, only humans are hungry. The statement does not provide any direct information about Alfred being a human. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred is hungry.\n- Since a donkey kicked Lewis, and only humans are hungry, Lewis is not necessarily hungry. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A human will run.\n3. A human is happy.\n4. Lewis didn't chase Hazel.\n5. A donkey kicked Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\n6. If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n7. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Lewis won't run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Statement 1**: This is a given condition that ensures the universe consists of exactly one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n2. **Statement 2**: Since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and a human will run, we can infer that the human in this scenario will run.\n3. **Statement 3**: A human is happy.\n4. **Statement 4**: Lewis didn't chase Hazel. This doesn't directly affect the running behavior but might be relevant for other conditions.\n5. **Statement 5**: A donkey kicked Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel. Since there is only one human, this statement simplifies to: A donkey kicked Lewis if the human did not kick Hazel.\n6. **Statement 6**: If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel. Since there is only one donkey, this statement simplifies to: If Hazel didn't chase herself, then Alfred was not kicked by the donkey only if the donkey did not kick Hazel.\n7. **Statement 7**: If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Lewis won't run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel. Since there is only one donkey, this statement simplifies to: If the donkey did not kick Alfred, then Lewis won't run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Deductions:\n- From Statement 2, we know the human will run.\n- From Statement 3, we know the human is happy.\n- From Statement 5, since there is only one human, the condition \"not all humans kicked Hazel\" is always true because there is only one human. Therefore, the donkey will kick Lewis.\n- From Statement 6, since the donkey kicks Lewis, it means not all donkeys kicked Alfred (since there is only one donkey). Thus, from Statement 7, if the donkey did not kick Alfred, then Lewis won't run. But since the donkey does kick Lewis, Lewis will run.\n- Since Lewis runs, and the human runs (from Statement 2), both Alfred and Lewis will run.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the correct statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n\nThis is the only statement that logically follows from the given conditions.",

A monkey kicked Alfred and Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n4. If not all donkeys will run, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n5. Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively)**: This means no individual can belong to more than one category.\n2. **Every monkey chased every human that chased every monkey**: This implies a complex interaction between monkeys and humans.\n3. **A monkey kicked Alfred and Lewis didn't kick Alfred**: This tells us about the actions of Alfred and Lewis.\n4. **If not all donkeys will run, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis**: This is a conditional statement involving the running of donkeys and the actions of Alfred and Hazel.\n5. **Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred**: This directly links Hazel to Alfred.\n\n### Deductions:\n- Since Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred, it follows that Alfred was chased by Hazel.\n- From point 3, we know a monkey (Hazel) kicked Alfred. So, Alfred was both chased and kicked by a monkey.\n- From point 4, since Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred, the condition \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is irrelevant for determining whether Alfred kicked Hazel.

This statement cannot be determined from the given information.\n2. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred**: This is true because Alfred was kicked by Hazel (a monkey) and he did not chase himself.\n3. **Alfred will run**: We have no direct information about whether Alfred will run. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.\n4. **Alfred won't run**: Similar to statement 3, we have no direct information about whether Alfred will run.

Since no donkeys kicked Alfred (statement 6), Alfred sees Lewis, which means \\( A \\) is false.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. A human saw a monkey that saw it.\n4. Every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred.\n5. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n6. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### 1. Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.\n- This statement can be broken into two parts:\n  - If Hazel isn't a human, then a human saw Hazel.\n  - If a human saw Hazel, then Hazel isn't a human.\n- From the given information, we know that a human saw a monkey that saw something. However, we do not have direct information about who saw whom among humans and Hazel. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude this statement based on the given information alone.\n\n#### 2. Hazel saw a human.\n- We know that a human saw a monkey that saw something. However, we do not have any information indicating whether Hazel was involved in this sequence of seeing. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n#### 3. Every human saw Hazel.\n- The statement \"every human saw Hazel\" would imply that all humans observed Hazel. However, the given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. It only states that every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred, but it does not specify which condition applies universally for humans.\n\n#### 4. No humans saw Hazel.\n- Similar to the previous statement, we do not have enough information to conclude that no humans saw Hazel. The given information does not rule out the possibility that some humans saw Hazel.\n\n#### 5. Hazel saw every human.\n- There is no information provided that suggests Hazel saw every human. The given information does not mention any interaction between Hazel and other humans.\n\n#### 6. Not all humans saw Hazel.\n- This statement is more plausible because the given information does not provide enough evidence to conclude that all humans saw Hazel. Since the statement \"every human saw Hazel\" is not supported, its negation (not all humans saw Hazel) is a reasonable conclusion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n\nThis is the most logically sound conclusion given the constraints and information provided.",

However, since the monkey drank (from the fourth piece of information), the condition for Alfred being kicked does not apply. Therefore, Alfred did not get kicked, and thus Alfred must have drunk. So, this statement is true.\n\n2. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - We already established that Alfred drank. Hazel cannot be a monkey, and since the only other options are donkey or human, and no humans are mentioned to have drunk (as per the context), Hazel must be the donkey. The donkey drank. Thus, both Alfred and Hazel drank. So, this statement is true.\n\n3. **A monkey drank.**\n   - The fourth piece of information directly states that every monkey drank. Since there is only one monkey, this statement is true.\n\n4. **No monkeys drank.**\n   - This contradicts the fourth piece of information, so this statement is false.\n\n5. **Not all monkeys drank.**\n   - This also contradicts the fourth piece of information, so this statement is false.\n\n6. **Only monkeys drank.**\n   - Since Hazel (a donkey) drank, this statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Lewis.\n3. A monkey chased Alfred and a human will run.\n4. No donkeys saw Hazel and a human will run.\n5. If Alfred ate, then every monkey saw Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\n6. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if not all donkeys will run.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### 1. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and a monkey chased Alfred.\n- This is directly stated as part of the given information. Therefore, it must be true.\n\n#### 2. Every donkey chased Alfred or not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n- We know that a monkey chased Alfred. However, we do not have direct information about whether every donkey chased Alfred. Also, we do not have direct information about whether all monkeys saw Hazel. The statement combines two unrelated conditions without clear logical connection from the given information. Thus, this statement does not necessarily have to be true based on the given information.\n\n#### 3. Every donkey chased Alfred unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n- Similar to the previous statement, we do not have enough information to determine whether every donkey chased Alfred. The condition \"unless not all monkeys saw Hazel\" does not provide a clear logical link to the behavior of donkeys. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true based on the given information.\n\n#### 4. Alfred will run.\n- From the given information, we know that a human will run. However, we do not have any direct information about Alfred running. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true based on the given information.\n\n#### 5. Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- Again, we know that a human will run, but we do not have any information about Lewis running. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true based on the given information.\n\n#### 6. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n- Let's analyze the given conditions:\n  - Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n  - A monkey chased Alfred.\n  - If Alfred ate, then every monkey saw Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\n  - If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if not all donkeys will run.\n  \n  The statement \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred\" introduces a new condition (Alfred saw Alfred) which is not supported by the given information. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**1. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and a monkey chased Alfred.**\n\nThis is the only statement that can be directly confirmed from the provided information.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. There is a monkey that every donkey saw.\n4. If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\n5. Only borogoves are beamish.\n6. Every rath gyred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 1, we know the universe consists exclusively of donkeys, humans, and monkeys.\n- Point 2 confirms that there is at least one of each type.\n- Point 3 tells us that there is a specific monkey that every donkey saw.\n- Point 4 involves conditional logic: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" This can be rephrased as: \"If some humans are awake, then Lewis is hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n- Points 5 and 6 provide additional information about borogoves and raths, but they do not directly affect the current analysis since no borogoves or raths are mentioned in the other points.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Only monkeys drank.**\n   - We have no information about who drank, so this cannot be concluded. Therefore, it is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Lewis drank.**\n   - Again, we have no information about who drank, so this cannot be concluded. Therefore, it is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys drank.**\n   - Similar to the previous two, we have no information about who drank, so this cannot be concluded. Therefore, it is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No monkeys drank.**\n   - Similarly, we have no information about who drank, so this cannot be concluded. Therefore, it is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Lewis and Hazel drank.**\n   - Again, we have no information about who drank, so this cannot be concluded. Therefore, it is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A monkey drank.**\n   - We still have no direct information about who drank, but we can infer something from the given conditions. Since there is a specific monkey that every donkey saw, and there is at least one of each type, it is possible that this monkey could be the one that drank. However, without more specific information, we cannot definitively conclude that a monkey drank. But given the options, this is the most plausible conclusion based on the available information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**6.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Hazel is a monkey.\n3. If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if not all donkeys will run.\n4. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\n5. A human will attack.\n6. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: \n\"If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if not all donkeys will run.\"\n\nThis can be rephrased as:\n- Alfred won't attack \u2192 (not all donkeys saw Hazel) \u2194 (not all donkeys will run)\n\nSince we know from statement 5 that \"A human will attack,\" Alfred must attack (because if Alfred won't attack, it would contradict the fact that a human will attack). Therefore, the left part of the implication is false (Alfred attacks).\n\nGiven that the left part is false, the right part must also be false for the implication to hold. So, the statement \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" must be true, and \"not all donkeys will run\" must be false. This means:\n- All donkeys saw Hazel.\n- All donkeys will run.\n\n#### Statement 4:\n\"If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\"\n\nThis can be rephrased as:\n- Lewis didn't chase Lewis \u2192 (every monkey saw Lewis) \u2194 (a human chased Hazel)\n\nSince Hazel is a monkey (statement 2), and every monkey saw Lewis (from the analysis of statement 3), the left part of the implication is true. For the implication to hold, the right part must also be true. Therefore:\n- A human chased Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 5:\n\"A human will attack.\"\n\nThis is already given and consistent with our previous findings.\n\n#### Statement 6:\n\"Every monkey chased Alfred.\"\n\nSince Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred, Hazel chased Alfred.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the above analysis, we have established the following truths:\n- All donkeys saw Hazel.\n- All donkeys will run.\n- A human chased Hazel.\n- Hazel chased Alfred.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the provided statements:\n\n1. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred.** - False, because Hazel chased Alfred.\n2. **Alfred didn't chase Hazel.** - True, because Alfred attacked and there is no information suggesting Alfred chased Hazel.\n3. **Alfred chased Hazel.** - False, because Alfred attacked and there is no information suggesting Alfred chased Hazel.\n4. **Alfred and Lewis will run.** - We cannot determine this directly from the given information. However, since all donkeys will run and Alfred is not specified as a donkey, we cannot conclude this definitively.\n5. **Alfred will run.** - We cannot determine this directly from the given information. However, since all donkeys will run and Alfred is not specified as a donkey, we cannot conclude this definitively.\n6. **Hazel chased Alfred.** - True, because every monkey chased Alfred and Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n- Hazel chased Alfred.\n\nSo, the correct answers are:\n2.

This implies that any entity that saw Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This is a tautology because \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is equivalent to \"Some donkeys did not chase Alfred,\" and the statement \"just in case\" here means the same as \"if and only if.\" So, this doesn't provide new information but confirms the equivalence.\n\n4. **If every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. For it to be true, we need to consider two cases:\n     - Case 1: Not every monkey saw Lewis. In this case, the condition \"Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel\" does not need to be checked.\n     - Case 2: Every monkey saw Lewis. Then, for Alfred to see Alfred, every human must have seen Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - Since no donkeys saw Hazel, this statement is true.\n\n2. **A donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - This is false because no donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n3. **Every donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - This is false because no donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n4. **Hazel saw a donkey.**\n   - This is false because no donkeys saw Hazel, and Hazel saw herself, so Hazel did not see any donkeys.\n\n5. **Hazel saw every donkey.**\n   - This is false because no donkeys saw Hazel, so Hazel could not have seen any donkeys.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - This is false because it contradicts the fact that Hazel saw herself.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**1.

A monkey chased Alfred and a human will run.\n5. Every monkey saw Alfred.\n6. No donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Alfred will run.**\n   - From point 4, we know that \"a human will run.\" Since Alfred is not specified as a donkey or a monkey, he must be a human. Therefore, Alfred will run. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **A monkey saw Alfred.**\n   - From point 5, we know that \"every monkey saw Alfred.\" This means that at least one monkey saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - Point 5 states that \"every monkey saw Alfred,\" which implies that all monkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Alfred saw every monkey.**\n   - The information provided does not give us any indication about whether Alfred saw every monkey. We only know that every monkey saw Alfred, but we have no information about Alfred's actions. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true, and we cannot conclude it must be true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Alfred saw a monkey.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, we do not have any information about what Alfred saw. We only know that every monkey saw Alfred, but we cannot conclude that Alfred saw a monkey. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true, and we cannot conclude it must be true based on the given information.\n\n6. **No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This directly contradicts point 5, which states that \"every monkey saw Alfred.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1. Alfred will run.\n2. A monkey saw Alfred.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**1 and 2 must be true.**",

There is no direct information about whether Lewis is asleep or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lewis is asleep based on the given information.\n   \n2. **Every human is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - This statement is partially true because it correctly states that every human is happy (since Lewis is a human and he is happy) and that a monkey kicked Alfred. However, it incorrectly states \"every human\" when only Lewis is mentioned as being happy. Thus, this statement is not entirely true.\n   \n3. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred isn't asleep, so this statement is false.\n   \n4. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred isn't asleep, so this statement is false.\n   \n5. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - This statement is contradictory. It says both \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" and \"every monkey kicked Lewis,\" which cannot both be true simultaneously. Therefore, this statement is false.\n   \n6. **Lewis and Alfred are asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred isn't asleep, so this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided statements must be true based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer:** None of the statements must be true.",

Hazel saw Hazel (this doesn't provide new information about the relationships between entities).\n4. A donkey saw every monkey.\n5. Every donkey chased every human that chased it.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4, we know that a donkey saw every monkey. This means that for any donkey \\(D\\) and any monkey \\(M\\), \\(D\\) saw \\(M\\).\n- From point 5, we know that every donkey \\(D\\) chased every human \\(H\\) that chased \\(D\\). This implies that if a human \\(H\\) chased a donkey \\(D\\), then \\(D\\) chased \\(H\\).\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **A donkey chased a human.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude this from the given information. While it is possible, we do not have enough information to say that it must happen. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased every human.**\n   - This statement is too strong. The given information only tells us that if a human chased a donkey, then the donkey chased the human. It does not imply that every donkey chased every human. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n3. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - This statement is also too strong. The given information does not provide enough evidence to conclude that no donkeys chased every human. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, this is too strong. The given information does not guarantee that every donkey chased every human. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every human.**\n   - Again, this is too strong. The given information does not guarantee that every donkey chased every human. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n6. **A donkey chased every human that chased it.**\n   - This statement aligns with the given information. If a human \\(H\\) chased a donkey \\(D\\), then according to point 5, \\(D\\) chased \\(H\\). However, this does not imply that \\(D\\) chased every human; it only implies that \\(D\\) chased the specific human \\(H\\) that chased \\(D\\). Therefore, this statement is consistent with the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**6.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. No donkeys saw Lewis.\n4. Every monkey saw Alfred.\n5. A monkey will attack unless every human saw Hazel.\n6. Only donkeys are asleep.\n7. Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since Hazel is a monkey, and every monkey saw Alfred, it follows that Hazel saw Alfred.\n- From point 5, for a monkey not to attack, every human must have seen Hazel. Since Hazel is a monkey, this condition is irrelevant because monkeys do not need to satisfy this condition to avoid attacking.\n- Since only donkeys are asleep, and no donkeys saw Lewis, we can infer that Lewis is either a human or a monkey. However, since Hazel is a monkey and monkeys saw Alfred, Lewis cannot be a monkey (because all monkeys saw Alfred). Therefore, Lewis must be a human.\n- Since Hazel is a monkey and saw Alfred, and no donkeys saw Lewis, we can conclude that Alfred is not a donkey. Alfred could be a human or a monkey. However, since Hazel is a monkey and saw Alfred, Alfred must be a human (because monkeys saw Alfred).\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Hazel doesn't see Alfred.**\n   - This is false because we established that Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n2. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - Since Hazel is a monkey and saw Alfred, and no condition prevents monkeys from attacking (as long as they are not humans who did not see Hazel), Alfred does not necessarily have to attack. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred and Lewis will attack.**\n   - As analyzed, Alfred is a human and Lewis is a human. Humans do not attack based on the given conditions. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - This is true because we established that Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n5. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the information provided does not specify whether Alfred saw Hazel or not. It only states that Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n6. **Alfred saw Hazel.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the information provided does not specify whether Alfred saw Hazel or not. It only states that Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. Hazel saw Alfred.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey.\n5. A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4: \"Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey.\"\n  - This means if a human \\(H\\) chased a donkey \\(D\\), then \\(D\\) chased \\(H\\).\n\n- From point 5: \"A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\"\n  - Let's denote the donkey as \\(D_1\\) and the human as \\(H_1\\). So, a monkey \\(M\\) chased \\(D_1\\) that chased \\(H_1\\).\n  - According to point 4, since \\(D_1\\) chased \\(H_1\\), \\(H_1\\) must have chased \\(D_1\\).\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **A donkey chased every human.**\n   - We cannot conclude this from the given information. The information only tells us about the relationship between specific donkeys and humans, not all donkeys and all humans.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - We know from point 5 that a donkey (\\(D_1\\)) chased a human (\\(H_1\\)). However, we do not have information about other donkeys chasing other humans. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true for all donkeys and all humans.\n\n3. **No humans chased every donkey.**\n   - Since no donkey chased a human that chased it (point 3), and we know from point 5 that a donkey chased a human, it implies that not every human can chase every donkey. If every human chased every donkey, then every donkey would chase every human, which contradicts point 3. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased a human.**\n   - This is false because point 5 states that a donkey chased a human.\n\n5. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, we cannot conclude this from the given information. The information only tells us about the relationship between specific donkeys and humans, not all donkeys and all humans.\n\n6. **Every donkey chased every human.**\n   - This is too strong a claim based on the given information.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\n3. A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\n4. No donkeys chased Alfred only if Alfred isn't a human.\n5. Not all donkeys chased Alfred if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\n6. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\nThis implies a reflexive property among monkeys. Each monkey sees another monkey, and that monkey sees the original monkey. This does not necessarily mean that every monkey saw every other monkey, just that there is a chain of sight where each monkey sees another monkey that sees it.\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\nThis establishes a sequence of actions involving a monkey, a donkey, and a human. It doesn't provide direct information about the sight relationships but confirms the existence of these entities in a specific order.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys chased Alfred only if Alfred isn't a human.\n- If Alfred is a human, then some donkeys chased Alfred.\n- If Alfred is not a human, then no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys chased Alfred if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\n- If Lewis saw Hazel, then not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n- If not all donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis saw Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 6: If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n- If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then either no humans are hungry or Alfred saw Alfred.\n- If Alfred did not see Alfred, then no humans are hungry.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n1. **There is a monkey that every monkey saw.**\n   - From Statement 2, we know each monkey sees another monkey, but it does not guarantee that one monkey sees all others. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No monkeys saw every monkey.**\n   - This is consistent with the information from Statement 2, as it only states that each monkey sees another monkey, not that one sees all. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Every monkey saw every monkey.**\n   - This would imply a complete mutual visibility among all monkeys, which is not guaranteed by Statement 2. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A monkey saw every monkey.**\n   - Similar to option 3, this would imply a complete mutual visibility, which is not guaranteed by the given information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A monkey saw a monkey.**\n   - This is directly supported by Statement 2, which states that every monkey saw a monkey that saw it. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **No monkeys saw a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which states that every monkey saw a monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n\n- **No monkeys saw every monkey.**\n- **A monkey saw a monkey.**\n\nThus, the correct answers are:\n\n2.

Therefore, at least one monkey (Hazel) saw Lewis. This statement is false.\n\n2. **Lewis saw a monkey.**\n   - Since Hazel is a monkey and Lewis sees Hazel, Lewis saw a monkey. This statement is true.\n\n3. **Every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - We only know for sure that Hazel (a monkey) saw Lewis. We do not have information about other monkeys. This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Lewis saw every monkey.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, we only know that Hazel (a monkey) was seen by Lewis. We do not have information about whether Lewis saw other monkeys. This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **A monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - As established, Hazel (a monkey) saw Lewis. This statement is true.\n\n6. **Not all monkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - We do not have enough information to confirm that not all monkeys saw Lewis. It is possible that some monkeys did not see Lewis, but we cannot definitively say this without more information. This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 2: Lewis saw a monkey.\n- Statement 5: A monkey saw Lewis.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**Statements 2 and 5 must be true.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A donkey saw every human.\n3. If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n4. Not all humans will run and Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 1, we know the universe consists of donkeys, humans, and monkeys, with at least one of each.\n- Point 2 states that \"a donkey saw every human.\" This means there is at least one donkey that saw every human.\n- Point 3 involves conditional logic: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" This can be simplified to:\n  - If not all humans are asleep, then either Alfred sees Lewis or not every monkey saw Hazel.\n- Point 4 states that \"Not all humans will run and Lewis isn't hungry.\" This provides no direct logical connection to the other points but confirms that Lewis is not hungry and some humans won't run.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **No donkeys saw every human.**\n   - This contradicts point 2, which states that a donkey saw every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A donkey saw a human.**\n   - Since a donkey saw every human (point 2), it follows that a donkey saw at least one human. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Every donkey saw every human.**\n   - While point 2 states that a donkey saw every human, it does not specify that every single donkey saw every human. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Every donkey saw a human.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, point 2 only guarantees that at least one donkey saw every human, not that every donkey did so. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **No donkeys saw a human.**\n   - This directly contradicts point 2, which states that a donkey saw every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **There is a donkey that every human saw.**\n   - This is equivalent to statement 2, which is true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 2: A donkey saw a human.**\n- **Statement 6: There is a donkey that every human saw.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that statements 2 and 6 must be true.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. If a human chased Hazel, then not all donkeys will run only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\n3. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.\n5. Not all donkeys chased Alfred and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.\n- This means Alfred is asleep.\n\n#### Statement 2: Not all donkeys chased Alfred and only donkeys are asleep.\n- Since Alfred is asleep, and only donkeys are asleep, Alfred must be a donkey.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude:\n- Alfred is a donkey and is asleep.\n\n#### Statement 3: If a human chased Hazel, then not all donkeys will run only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\n- This statement involves conditional logic. We need to consider the conditions under which it holds true.\n\n#### Statement 4: If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n- This statement also involves conditional logic. However, since we have no information about Lewis being a donkey or monkeys kicking anyone, we cannot derive new information from this directly.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements to Determine Truth:\n\n1. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - Alfred is a donkey and is asleep, so he will not run.\n   - There is no direct information about Hazel running, but the statement \"not all donkeys will run only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" does not provide enough information to determine if Hazel will run. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - Alfred is a donkey and is asleep, so he will not run.\n   - There is no direct information about Lewis running, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - From our analysis, Alfred is indeed a donkey.\n\n4. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - Alfred is a donkey and is asleep, so he will not run. This statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - Alfred is a donkey and is asleep, so he will not run. This statement is false.\n\n6. **Alfred isn't a donkey.**\n   - Alfred is a donkey. This statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Alfred won't run.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**4.

A monkey will attack or not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: \"No monkeys chased every monkey.\"\n- This statement is false because the third piece of information states that \"Every monkey chased every monkey.\" Therefore, it is impossible for no monkeys to have chased every monkey.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"A monkey chased every monkey.\"\n- This statement is true based on the third piece of information, which directly states that \"Every monkey chased every monkey.\"\n\n#### Statement 1: \"No monkeys chased a monkey that chased it.\"\n- We need to check if this can be true or false. Since every monkey chased every other monkey, it means that if Monkey A chased Monkey B, then Monkey B also chased Monkey A. However, the statement says \"no monkeys chased a monkey that chased it,\" which contradicts the fact that every monkey chased every other monkey. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"There is not a monkey that every monkey chased.\"\n- This statement is false because, as established, every monkey chased every other monkey. Therefore, every monkey did chase every other monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Alfred will attack.\"\n- There is no information given about Alfred attacking anyone. The only information we have about Alfred is that he kicked Lewis. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will attack.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"No monkeys chased a monkey.\"\n- This statement is false because, as stated, every monkey chased every other monkey. Therefore, it is not true that no monkeys chased a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey chased every monkey.**\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 4 must be true.**",

No donkeys saw Hazel.\n6. Every human saw Alfred.\n7. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 5, we know that no donkeys saw Hazel because \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" is explicitly stated.\n- From point 6, since every human saw Alfred, and there is at least one human, it means at least one human saw Alfred.\n- Point 7 states a conditional: \"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" Since no donkeys saw Hazel (point 5), this part of the condition is irrelevant for our analysis. The key here is the \"only if every monkey saw Hazel\" part. This implies that if not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel must have kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel. However, since no donkeys saw Hazel, the condition about \"every monkey saw Hazel\" does not affect the truth of the statement about Hazel kicking Alfred directly.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Alfred will run.**\n   - We do not have any direct information about whether Alfred will run or not. The given conditions do not provide any information about Alfred running. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Hazel will run.**\n   - Similarly, we do not have any direct information about whether Hazel will run or not.

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Hazel and Alfred will run.**\n   - This statement combines both previous points and cannot be concluded as true without additional information.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys will run and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This statement is partially true based on the given information. We know from point 5 that no donkeys saw Hazel, and from point 3 that not all monkeys will run. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - Again, we do not have any direct information about whether Alfred will or will not run. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - This statement combines both previous points and cannot be concluded as true without additional information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4.

Since we know that every monkey saw Alfred, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This also contradicts statement 5. Since every monkey saw Alfred, it means all monkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Alfred will run.**\n   - We have no direct information about whether Alfred will run or not based on the given statements. The only relevant statement is about Lewis, but it doesn't provide any information about Alfred's behavior. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will run.\n\n5. **Alfred saw every monkey.**\n   - We have no information about whether Alfred saw every monkey or not.

A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Not all monkeys chased Lewis.**\n   - According to point 3, every monkey chased Lewis. Therefore, it cannot be true that not all monkeys chased Lewis. This statement is false.\n\n2. **If every monkey chased Lewis, then not all monkeys chased Lewis.**\n   - From point 3, we know that every monkey chased Lewis.

This statement is false.\n\n3. **Lewis chased a monkey.**\n   - The information provided does not give any direct indication about whether Lewis chased a monkey or not. We only know that every monkey chased Lewis. This statement could be true or false based on additional information not provided. We cannot conclude it must be true from the given information.\n\n4. **No monkeys chased Lewis.**\n   - Point 3 states that every monkey chased Lewis.

We only know that every monkey chased Lewis. This statement could be true or false based on additional information not provided. We cannot conclude it must be true from the given information.\n\n6. **A monkey chased Lewis.**\n   - Point 3 states that every monkey chased Lewis.

A monkey kicked Hazel or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n- From point 4, no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- If no donkeys kicked Hazel, then the only way for the statement \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" to be false is if every donkey kicked Lewis.\n- However, we do not have enough information to definitively say that every donkey kicked Lewis.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### 6. No donkeys kicked Hazel and every monkey kicked Lewis.\n- Point 4 directly states that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- Point 6 states that not all monkeys kicked Lewis, which means it is not true that every monkey kicked Lewis.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**No donkeys kicked Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.**\n\nThus, the correct answer is **Statement 2**.",

Hazel will not run because she is a human and only donkeys run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - As explained, Alfred will run because he is a donkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Lewis saw Lewis.**\n   - We concluded that for every donkey to have seen Hazel, Lewis must not see Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **Statement 2: Lewis doesn't see Lewis.**\n- **Statement 5: Alfred will run.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**Statements 2 and 5 must be true.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Every human chased a monkey.\n4. Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n5. A human will run.\n6. Alfred isn't hungry.\n7. Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since every human chased a monkey, we can infer that there is an interaction between humans and monkeys.\n- The fact that a human will run does not provide specific information about who chases whom, but it confirms that there is at least one human.\n- Hazel didn't chase Alfred, which is irrelevant to the chasing of monkeys.\n- Alfred and Lewis not being hungry also do not affect the chasing behavior directly.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **No humans chased a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every human chased a monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **No humans chased every monkey.**\n   - This means that not all monkeys were chased by every human. However, since every human chased at least one monkey, it doesn't necessarily mean they chased every single monkey. This could be true, but it is not guaranteed based on the given information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A human chased every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that every single monkey was chased by at least one human. While it is possible, the given information only states that every human chased a monkey, not that every human chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **There is a human that every monkey chased.**\n   - This would mean that there is at least one human who chased every single monkey. Again, while it is possible, the given information does not guarantee this. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every human chased every monkey.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, this would mean that every human chased every single monkey. The given information only states that every human chased at least one monkey, not every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A human chased a monkey.**\n   - This is directly supported by the given information that every human chased a monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**6. A human chased a monkey.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

However, since no humans saw a monkey, and Hazel saw every monkey, Hazel cannot be a human. Therefore, Hazel must be a monkey. This statement is true.\n\n2. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human**:\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it suggests that Hazel being a human is a necessary condition for Hazel not being a human, which is logically impossible. This statement is false.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a human**:\n   - As established, since Hazel saw every monkey and no humans saw a monkey, Hazel cannot be a human. This statement is true.\n\n4. **Hazel is a human**:\n   - We have already determined that Hazel cannot be a human. This statement is false.\n\n5. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human**:\n   - This is a contradiction similar to the second statement. It suggests that not being a human implies being a human, which is logically impossible. This statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1.

According to this statement, for every pair of \\(M_i\\) and \\(D_j\\), \\(M_i\\) kicked \\(D_j\\).\n\n3. **Every monkey kicked Lewis and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - This means that every monkey kicked Lewis, and at least one monkey (let's call it \\(M_k\\)) also kicked Alfred.\n\n4. **If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no donkeys ate.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. We need to consider two cases:\n     - Case 1: Hazel chased Hazel. In this case, the condition \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no donkeys ate\" does not apply.\n     - Case 2: Hazel didn't chase Hazel. Then, for the condition to hold, either all donkeys did kick Alfred, or some donkeys ate.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that for every pair of \\(D_i\\) and \\(M_j\\), \\(D_i\\) kicked \\(M_j\\). However, the given information only states that every monkey kicked every donkey, not the other way around. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - Since every monkey kicked every donkey, and there is at least one of each, it follows that at least one donkey kicked at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **No donkeys kicked every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that there exists at least one monkey that no donkey kicked. However, since every monkey kicked every donkey, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - As mentioned earlier, the given information only states that every monkey kicked every donkey, not the other way around.

Therefore, no donkeys kicked Alfred. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **A donkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - This contradicts the fact that no donkeys kicked Alfred. This statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - Since every donkey is happy, Alfred, being a donkey, is happy. This statement must be true.\n\n4. **Alfred kicked every donkey.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that Alfred kicked every donkey. This statement cannot be confirmed or denied based on the given information.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.**\n   - This statement is ambiguous and doesn't align with the clear conclusion that no donkeys kicked Alfred. This statement cannot be confirmed or denied based on the given information.\n\n6. **Every donkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - This directly contradicts the fact that no donkeys kicked Alfred. This statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n1. No donkeys kicked Alfred.\n3. Alfred is happy.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **1 and 3**.",

Since the human is happy, we need to determine who the human is based on the next piece of information.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys will run.**\n   - This means at least one donkey will not run. Given there is only one donkey, this donkey will not run.\n\n5. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - This directly tells us that Lewis is the donkey.\n\nFrom the above points, we can deduce:\n- Lewis is the donkey.\n- The human must be Alfred (since Lewis is the donkey and there is only one human).\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Lewis will run.**\n   - We know from point 4 that not all donkeys will run, and since Lewis is the only donkey, he will not run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - Alfred is the human, and there is no information suggesting that humans will or will not run.

A monkey kicked Hazel only if no humans are asleep.\n5. If no humans chased Hazel, then Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The given information does not provide any direct relationship between donkeys and monkeys regarding chasing. We know that every monkey chased every donkey, but we do not have information about whether a donkey chased a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- This statement is also not necessarily true. Again, the given information does not provide any direct relationship between donkeys and monkeys regarding chasing. We cannot conclude that no donkeys chased every monkey based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. While every monkey chased every donkey, we do not have information indicating that a specific donkey chased a specific monkey. It is possible that all donkeys chased all monkeys, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The given information does not provide any direct relationship between donkeys and monkeys regarding chasing. We only know that every monkey chased every donkey, but we do not have information about whether every donkey chased every monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. Similar to the previous statements, the given information does not provide any direct relationship between donkeys and monkeys regarding chasing. We only know that every monkey chased every donkey, but we do not have information about whether every donkey chased a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 6: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n- This statement must be true. Since every monkey chased every donkey, it follows that for any given monkey, there exists at least one donkey that was chased by that monkey. Therefore, there is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**Statement 6: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 6**",

A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n5. Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Lewis is a donkey unless Hazel isn't a human.\"\nThis can be rephrased as:\n- If Hazel is a human, then Lewis is a donkey.\n- If Hazel isn't a human, then Lewis is not necessarily a donkey (he could be a human or a monkey).\n\n#### Statement 4: \"A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\"\n- This means Lewis cannot be a donkey because a monkey is the only thing that is guaranteed to be hungry.\n\nFrom Statements 3 and 4, we conclude:\n- Lewis is not a donkey.\n- Since Lewis is not a donkey, he must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.\"\n- Alfred isn't hungry.\n- It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry, so Lewis must be hungry.\n\nSince Lewis is hungry and a monkey is the only thing that is guaranteed to be hungry, we conclude:\n- Lewis must be a monkey.\n\nGiven that Lewis is a monkey, from Statement 4, we know:\n- A monkey is hungry, so Lewis is indeed hungry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - From Statement 5, Alfred isn't hungry. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a tautology (a statement that is always true regardless of the truth value of its components). It is true.\n\n3. **Hazel is a human.**\n   - We have no direct information about Hazel being a human or not. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n4. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a contradiction (a statement that is always false regardless of the truth value of its components). It is false.\n\n5. **Hazel isn't a human.**\n   - We have no direct information about Hazel being a human or not. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - Alfred isn't hungry (Statement 5), and Lewis is hungry (from the analysis above). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2. Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.**\n\nThis is a tautology and is always true.",

Therefore, it is not possible for no donkeys to chase every donkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every donkey chased every donkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. The second piece of information only states that every donkey chased every donkey that chased it, not that every donkey chased every other donkey. So, we cannot conclude that every donkey chased every donkey.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey chased a donkey.\n- This statement must be true. Since there is at least one donkey and every donkey chased every donkey that chased it, there must be at least one instance where a donkey chased another donkey.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased a donkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The second piece of information only guarantees that if a donkey \\(D_1\\) chased another donkey \\(D_2\\), then \\(D_1\\) also chased \\(D_2\\). It does not guarantee that every donkey chased some other donkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\n- This statement is true. The second piece of information directly states that every donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey chased every donkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. As mentioned earlier, the second piece of information only guarantees that if a donkey \\(D_1\\) chased another donkey \\(D_2\\), then \\(D_1\\) also chased \\(D_2\\).

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n4. No donkeys saw Hazel.\n5. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. No donkeys saw Hazel (reiterating point 4).\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\"\n- From points 4 and 5, we know no donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- This statement is consistent with the given information.\n- Therefore, Statement 1 could be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n- From points 4 and 5, we know no donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- Since Lewis isn't a donkey, he can't have seen Hazel as a donkey.\n- However, the statement does not specify whether Lewis sees Hazel in another capacity (e.g., as a human or a monkey).\n- We cannot definitively conclude that Lewis doesn't see Hazel based on the given information.\n- Therefore, Statement 2 might be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information alone.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n- From points 4 and 5, we know no donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- The statement claims that Lewis doesn't see Hazel, which is consistent with Lewis not being a donkey.\n- However, the statement also claims that not all donkeys saw Hazel, which is true based on point 4.\n- Therefore, Statement 3 could be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n- This statement is contradictory because it says both \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" and \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n- These two parts cannot both be true simultaneously.\n- Therefore, Statement 4 is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Lewis.\"\n- From points 4 and 5, we know no donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- Since Lewis isn't a donkey, the part about no donkeys seeing Lewis is consistent.\n- Therefore, Statement 5 could be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\"\n- From points 3 and 5, we know Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- Both parts of the statement are consistent with the given information.\n- Therefore, Statement 6 could be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n\n1. Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n3. Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n5. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Lewis.\n6. Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for which, if any, of the following statements must be true, and considering the context of the problem, the most directly supported statement from the given information is:\n\n**Statement 1: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\nThis is the most straightforward and directly supported statement based on the given conditions.",

Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\"\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- Point 2 states \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred,\" which is true.\n- Point 3 states \"No donkeys saw Hazel,\" which is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is **Statement 6**.",

The only information we have is that no humans kicked Lewis, but this does not imply anything about Lewis kicking a human. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Lewis kicked every human.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, we do not have any information indicating that Lewis kicked every human. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n4. **Every human kicked Lewis.**\n   - This directly contradicts point 3, which states that no humans kicked Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A human kicked Lewis or Lewis kicked Lewis.**\n   - As established, no humans kicked Lewis (point 3). Therefore, for this statement to be true, Lewis would need to have kicked himself. However, there is no information suggesting that Lewis kicked himself. Therefore, this statement may or may not be true based on the given information.\n\n6. **A human kicked Lewis.**\n   - Again, from point 3, we know no humans kicked Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**1. Not all humans kicked Lewis.**\n\nThis is because we are explicitly told that no humans kicked Lewis, which directly implies that not all humans kicked Lewis.",

Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### 1. No donkeys saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n- From point 3, we know \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"\n- Point 4 states \"Lewis saw Alfred,\" so it is not true that \"Lewis did not see Alfred.\"\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### 2. Lewis is a donkey or Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n- We know from point 3 that no donkeys saw Lewis, which means Lewis cannot be a donkey.\n- Since Lewis saw Alfred (point 4), it is not true that \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\"\n- Therefore, this statement is false because it suggests either Lewis is a donkey (which is false) or Alfred doesn't see Lewis (which is also false).\n\n#### 3. Lewis is a donkey unless Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n- As established, Lewis is not a donkey (point 3).\n- The condition \"unless Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is irrelevant since Alfred does see Lewis.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### 4. If Alfred doesn't see Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis.\n- Alfred seeing Alfred is irrelevant here; the statement is about Alfred not seeing himself.\n- Since Alfred sees Lewis (point 4), the antecedent \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is false.\n- A false antecedent makes the entire implication true regardless of the consequent.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### 5. Lewis is a donkey or it is not the case that Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n- As established, Lewis is not a donkey.\n- Since Alfred sees Lewis (point 4), it is not the case that \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\"\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### 6. No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.\n- This is a restatement of points 3 and 4.\n- Both parts are true based on the given information.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information step by step and analyze the implications for each statement.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey kicked Hazel.\n3. Every human chased every donkey that chased every human.\n4. Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n5. Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n6. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n7. It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n8. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 1, we know there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- From point 2, since every monkey kicked Hazel, and there is at least one monkey, it follows that at least one monkey kicked Hazel.\n- From point 3, every human chased every donkey that chased every human. This implies a complex interaction between humans and donkeys, but it does not directly affect our current analysis.\n- From point 4, Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n- From point 5, Lewis didn't kick Alfred, which is irrelevant to our current analysis.\n- From point 6, Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- From point 7, since Lewis sees Hazel (from point 6 and point 7), it means Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n- From point 8, if every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis. Since every monkey kicked Hazel, the condition \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" holds true only if every monkey kicked Lewis. This is consistent with the given information.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - We need to determine if not all donkeys saw Hazel. Since every monkey kicked Hazel and there is at least one monkey, it is possible that some donkeys did not see Hazel. However, from point 7, we know Lewis sees Hazel, so this statement is true.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This statement is false because if not all donkeys saw Hazel, it does not imply that no donkeys saw Lewis. In fact, Lewis seeing Hazel does not preclude donkeys from also seeing Hazel.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - This statement is false because Lewis sees Hazel, as stated in point 7.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - This statement is false because Lewis isn't a donkey, as stated in point 6.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - This statement is true based on the previous analysis.\n\n6. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - This statement is true based on points 4 and 6.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n5. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\nHowever, the question asks for which, if any, of the following statements must be true. Based on the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**Statement 1: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n\nThis is the only statement that must be true based on the given conditions.",

A human saw Lewis.\n6. It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, we know no donkeys saw Alfred. This means Alfred cannot be a donkey because if he were, a donkey would have seen him, which contradicts the statement.\n- Therefore, Alfred must be either a human or a monkey.\n- Point 4 tells us that a donkey kicked Lewis. Since no donkeys saw Alfred, it is possible that the donkey who kicked Lewis could be different from the one that saw Alfred.\n- Point 5 states that a human saw Lewis. This means Lewis was seen by a human, and since a donkey kicked Lewis, it implies that the donkey and the human who saw Lewis are different entities.\n- Point 6 states that it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel. This is a tautology and doesn't provide new information about the entities involved.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - We concluded that Alfred cannot be a donkey because no donkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Every donkey saw Alfred.**\n   - We know no donkeys saw Alfred, so this statement is false.\n\n3. **Alfred saw a donkey.**\n   - There is no information provided that directly states Alfred saw a donkey. The only information we have is that no donkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A donkey saw Alfred.**\n   - As established, no donkeys saw Alfred.

Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\n5. Not all monkeys will run.\n6. It is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased a human.\n- From statement 4, we know that every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\n- This implies that for a donkey to chase a human, there must be a donkey that chases a human first.\n- Since there is at least one of each type (donkey, human, and monkey), let's denote a donkey as \\(D\\), a human as \\(H\\), and a monkey as \\(M\\).\n- If \\(D\\) chases \\(H\\), then every donkey (including \\(D\\)) would chase \\(H\\). However, since there is no donkey that every donkey chased (from statement 3), it means that not all donkeys necessarily chase \\(H\\).\n- Therefore, it is possible that only some donkeys chase humans, but not all. So, statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey chased every human.\n- From statement 4, every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\n- This does not imply that every donkey chased every human directly. It only implies that if a donkey \\(D_1\\) chases a human \\(H\\), then every other donkey \\(D_2\\) also chases \\(H\\).\n- Since there is no donkey that every donkey chased (from statement 3), it means that not all donkeys necessarily chase every human. So, statement 2 is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey chased a human.\n- As discussed above, from statement 4, if a donkey \\(D_1\\) chases a human \\(H\\), then every other donkey \\(D_2\\) also chases \\(H\\).\n- However, since there is no donkey that every donkey chased (from statement 3), it means that not all donkeys necessarily chase every human. So, statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased every human.\n- This is a stronger claim than what we have derived from the given statements. We know that if a donkey chases a human, then every other donkey also chases that human, but not all donkeys necessarily chase every human. So, statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys chased every human.\n- This is consistent with the information provided. Since there is no donkey that every donkey chased (from statement 3), it follows that not all donkeys necessarily chase every human. So, statement 5 is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased a human.\n- This is too strong a claim. We know that some donkeys might chase humans, but not all. So, statement 6 is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: No donkeys chased every human.**\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 5 must be true.**",

If every monkey chased Lewis, then not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred won't run.\n- From statement 3, we know that every human will run and every human saw Alfred. However, Alfred is not specified as a human, so we cannot conclude that Alfred won't run based on the given information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- We know from statement 3 that every human will run and every human saw Alfred. Since Alfred is not specified as a human, we cannot conclude that Alfred will run. Also, there is no direct information about whether Lewis is a human or what Lewis does, so we cannot conclude that Lewis will run. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis will run.\n- There is no direct information about whether Lewis runs or not. The only information we have about running is that every human will run, but we do not know if Lewis is a human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A human saw Alfred just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n- From statement 2, we know that not all donkeys chased Alfred. This means that it is possible for a human to see Alfred (since every human saw Alfred). However, the statement \"A human saw Alfred just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred\" implies a conditional relationship that is not directly supported by the given information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred will run.\n- As previously discussed, Alfred is not specified as a human, and there is no direct information about whether Alfred runs or not. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A human saw Alfred if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n- From statement 3, we know that every human saw Alfred. However, statement 2 tells us that not all donkeys chased Alfred, but it does not imply that no donkeys chased Alfred. Therefore, the \"if and only if\" condition is not satisfied because the absence of all donkeys chasing Alfred is not necessary for a human to see Alfred. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided statements must be true based on the given information.

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **A donkey will run.**\n   - Since Hazel kicked a donkey, and every donkey runs, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys will run.**\n   - The information provided does not give any indication that some donkeys might not run. In fact, since every donkey runs, this statement is false.\n\n4. **No donkeys will run.**\n   - This contradicts the information that every donkey runs. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - There is no information provided that suggests either Alfred or Hazel will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Only donkeys will run.**\n   - While it is true that every donkey runs, the information does not exclude the possibility that humans or monkeys might also run under different conditions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that only donkeys will run.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**2. A donkey will run.**\n\nFinal Answer: 2. A donkey will run.",

Not all donkeys saw Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n3. A monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n4. If Alfred ate, then no humans are hungry only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n5. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\n6. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n- This means that some donkeys did not see Hazel, and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n- Since not all donkeys saw Hazel (from Statement 2), it follows that no monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 5: If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\n- Since not all donkeys saw Hazel (from Statement 2), for not all donkeys to have kicked Alfred, Hazel must have kicked Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 6: If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n- From Statement 5, we know that not all donkeys kicked Alfred because Hazel kicked Alfred. Therefore, this statement does not provide new information about Hazel being hungry or not.\n\n### Evaluating Each Option:\n\n1. **Hazel kicked a monkey.**\n   - There is no direct evidence from the given statements that Hazel kicked a monkey. We only know that a monkey kicked Alfred, and no monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n2. **A monkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - From Statement 3, we know that a monkey could only kick Hazel if every donkey saw Hazel. However, since not all donkeys saw Hazel (Statement 2), no monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n3. **Every monkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - This is false based on Statement 3, as no monkey kicked Hazel when not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n4. **Alfred ate.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred ate or not. The statement about Alfred eating is conditional and depends on other conditions that are not fully met without additional information.\n\n5. **No monkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This is true based on Statement 3, as no monkey could have kicked Hazel when not all donkeys saw her.\n\n6. **Hazel kicked every monkey.**\n   - There is no evidence provided that Hazel kicked any monkey, let alone every monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\n4. A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\n5. If every human is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Every monkey chased every monkey.\"\n- This statement suggests that for every pair of monkeys \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\), \\(M_1\\) chased \\(M_2\\). However, the given condition \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it\" does not imply that every monkey chased every other monkey. It only implies a reflexive chase pattern where each monkey chases another monkey that also chases it. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"A monkey chased a monkey.\"\n- The given condition \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it\" directly implies that at least one monkey chased another monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"A monkey chased every monkey.\"\n- This statement suggests that for every monkey \\(M\\), some other monkey \\(M'\\) chased \\(M\\). However, the given condition only states that each monkey chased a specific monkey that also chased it, not that every monkey was chased by every other monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 1: \"No monkeys chased every monkey.\"\n- This statement is the negation of Statement 6. Since we have already determined that Statement 6 is not necessarily true, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"There is a monkey that every monkey chased.\"\n- This statement suggests that there exists a single monkey \\(M\\) such that every other monkey chased \\(M\\). However, the given condition only states that each monkey chased a specific monkey that also chased it, not that there is a single monkey that every other monkey chased. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"No monkeys chased a monkey.\"\n- This statement suggests that no monkey chased any other monkey. However, the given condition \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it\" directly contradicts this statement. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey chased a monkey.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**Statement 4 must be true.**",

Every monkey chased a donkey.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This statement is a conditional statement: \"P if and only if not Q\" where P is \"every human is asleep\" and Q is \"all humans are asleep.\"\n   - This is logically equivalent to saying that if every human is asleep, then it is not true that all humans are asleep, and vice versa.\n   - Since we know Hazel is a human, and there is at least one other human, it is possible for some humans to be awake while others are asleep. Therefore, this statement can be true under certain conditions but does not necessarily have to be true based on the given information alone. It depends on the specific state of sleep of the humans.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased Hazel.**\n   - From the given information, every donkey chased every human. Since Hazel is a human, every donkey must have chased Hazel.\n   - This statement must be true.\n\n3. **Hazel chased a donkey.**\n   - The information does not provide any direct evidence about whether Hazel chased any donkey. We only know that every donkey chased every human, but this does not imply that every human chased every donkey.\n   - This statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased Hazel.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given information that every donkey chased every human, and since Hazel is a human, this statement cannot be true.\n   - This statement must be false.\n\n5. **Hazel chased every donkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, the information does not provide any evidence that Hazel chased any donkey. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys chased Hazel.**\n   - This statement is the negation of statement 2.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Alfred ate.\n4. Lewis saw Lewis if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis.\n5. Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human saw Lewis and Hazel is a monkey.\n- From the given information, we know that Lewis saw Lewis if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis. This means that for Lewis to see himself, no monkeys can see him.\n- Also, Lewis saw himself just in case not all humans saw Hazel. This implies that if all humans saw Hazel, then Lewis would not have seen himself.\n- However, the statement \"A human saw Lewis and Hazel is a monkey\" does not directly follow from the given conditions. We need more specific information about who saw whom and what Hazel is. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: No monkeys saw Lewis if and only if a human saw Hazel.\n- From the given information, Lewis saw himself if and only if no monkeys saw him. This means that if no monkeys saw Lewis, then he saw himself.\n- The statement also says that Lewis saw himself just in case not all humans saw Hazel. So, if all humans did not see Hazel, then Lewis saw himself, which means no monkeys saw him.\n- Conversely, if no monkeys saw Lewis, then Lewis saw himself, which means not all humans saw Hazel.\n- Therefore, this statement is true based on the given conditions.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel isn't a human just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.\n- From the given information, Lewis saw himself if and only if no monkeys saw him. This means that if no monkeys saw Lewis, then he saw himself.\n- The statement also says that Lewis saw himself just in case not all humans saw Hazel. So, if all humans did not see Hazel, then Lewis saw himself, which means no monkeys saw him.\n- Conversely, if no monkeys saw Lewis, then Lewis saw himself, which means not all humans saw Hazel.\n- Therefore, Hazel is not a human if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis. This statement is true based on the given conditions.\n\n#### Statement 4: Hazel is a human only if every monkey saw Lewis.\n- From the given information, Lewis saw himself if and only if no monkeys saw him. This means that if no monkeys saw Lewis, then he saw himself.\n- The statement also says that Lewis saw himself just in case not all humans saw Hazel. So, if all humans did not see Hazel, then Lewis saw himself, which means no monkeys saw him.\n- However, the statement \"Hazel is a human only if every monkey saw Lewis\" is not supported by the given conditions. It suggests a stronger condition than what is provided. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: If Hazel is a human, then every monkey saw Lewis.\n- This statement is the converse of Statement 4. Since Statement 4 is not necessarily true, its converse is also not necessarily true. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: No monkeys saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.\n- From the given information, Lewis saw himself if and only if no monkeys saw him. This means that if no monkeys saw Lewis, then he saw himself.\n- The statement also says that Lewis saw himself just in case not all humans saw Hazel. So, if all humans did not see Hazel, then Lewis saw himself, which means no monkeys saw him.\n- Therefore, this statement is true based on the given conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n2. No monkeys saw Lewis if and only if a human saw Hazel.\n3. Hazel isn't a human just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.\n6. No monkeys saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n**Statements 2, 3, and 6 must be true.**",

Therefore, statement 1 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n- This is directly derived from combining statements 3 and 4 as explained above.\n- Therefore, statement 2 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred if and only if every human chased Hazel.\"\n- We know that Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred (from the analysis of statements 3 and 4).\n- However, there is no direct information linking \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" to \"every human chased Hazel.\"\n- Therefore, statement 3 cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Alfred and Hazel are asleep.\"\n- From statement 2, we know Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n- From statement 4, Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n- If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Alfred is asleep (from statement 2).\n- However, there is no information about Hazel being asleep.\n- Therefore, statement 4 cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Alfred is asleep.\"\n- As explained for statement 4, if no donkeys chased Alfred, then Alfred is asleep.\n- From statement 4, Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n- Therefore, Alfred is asleep if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n- Since we can't definitively conclude that no donkeys chased Alfred without additional information, we cannot conclusively say Alfred is asleep.\n- Therefore, statement 5 cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if every human chased Hazel.\"\n- There is no direct information linking \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" to \"every human chased Hazel.\"\n- Therefore, statement 6 cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys saw Lewis.\n3. A donkey saw a donkey that saw a monkey.\n4. Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a monkey chased Hazel.\n5. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n6. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys saw Lewis.\nThis is directly given as a fact.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey saw a donkey that saw a monkey.\nThis means there exists a chain of sight where a donkey saw another donkey who saw a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a monkey chased Hazel.\nThis implies that if a monkey chased Hazel, Alfred would see Alfred. Since we have no information suggesting a monkey chased Hazel, we cannot definitively conclude anything about Alfred seeing Alfred from this statement alone.\n\n#### Statement 5: If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\nThis can be broken down into two parts:\n- If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then either not all donkeys kicked Hazel or every human saw Hazel.\n- This means that if Lewis didn't chase Lewis, it must be the case that either not all donkeys kicked Hazel or every human saw Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 6: If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\nThis can be broken down into two parts:\n- If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n- This means that for Alfred to run, it must be the case that every monkey saw Hazel if not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n1. **Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This contradicts the given statement that no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - This aligns with the given statement that no donkeys saw Lewis. We do not have enough information to definitively say whether Lewis is a donkey or not, but this option does not contradict any given information.\n\n3. **Lewis saw every donkey.**\n   - There is no information given that suggests Lewis saw any donkeys. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This is consistent with the given statement that no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this must be true.\n\n5. **A donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This contradicts the given statement that no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n6. **Lewis saw a donkey.**\n   - There is no information given that suggests Lewis saw any donkeys. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **4. Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**",

This means if no monkeys saw Lewis, then every human drank.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - True: From point 4, Hazel didn't chase Alfred. From point 6, Hazel saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n2. **Hazel saw Hazel and Alfred didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - True: From point 6, Hazel saw Hazel. From point 4, Hazel didn't chase Alfred, so Alfred didn't chase Alfred is implied. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - True: From point 4, Hazel didn't chase Alfred, so Alfred didn't chase Alfred is implied. From point 6, Hazel saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - False: From point 6, Hazel saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - False: From point 6, Hazel saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Hazel saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - False: From point 6, Hazel saw Hazel. However, from point 4, Hazel didn't chase Alfred, so Alfred didn't chase Alfred is true. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Hazel didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n2. Hazel saw Hazel and Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n3. Alfred didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are statements 1, 2, and 3.",

It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n- This means we have at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: Only donkeys are hungry.\n- This means no humans or monkeys can be hungry.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all humans kicked Lewis.\n- This means at least one human did not kick Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 4: Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n- This implies that if Hazel is not a human, then every donkey saw Hazel. However, since we know there is at least one human, Hazel cannot be a non-human (donkey or monkey) because that would contradict the exclusivity condition. Therefore, Hazel must be a human.\n\n#### Statement 5: If a donkey kicked Hazel, then Alfred isn't a human.\n- Since Hazel is a human, this statement does not provide new information directly about Alfred being a human or not.\n\n#### Statement 6: A monkey kicked Alfred.\n- This tells us that Alfred was kicked by a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 7: It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n- This means Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- From Statement 2, since only donkeys are hungry, and Lewis is not a donkey, Lewis is neither hungry.\n- From Statement 6, a monkey kicked Alfred, so Alfred is not a donkey (since only donkeys are hungry). Therefore, Alfred is not hungry.\n\nGiven these conclusions, we can evaluate the provided statements:\n\n1. **Lewis is hungry.** - False, as Lewis is not a donkey.\n2. **Alfred isn't hungry.** - True, as Alfred was kicked by a monkey, not a donkey.\n3. **Alfred is hungry.** - False, as Alfred was kicked by a monkey.\n4. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.** - False, as both are not hungry.\n5. **Alfred and Hazel are hungry.** - False, as neither Alfred nor Hazel are donkeys.\n6. **Lewis isn't hungry.** - True, as Lewis is not a donkey.\n\nThus, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **Alfred isn't hungry.**\n- **Lewis isn't hungry.**\n\nSo, the correct answers are:\n\n2. Alfred isn't hungry.\n6. Lewis isn't hungry.",

However, since we don't have information about whether every human saw Hazel, we can't directly infer anything about the happiness of donkeys from this alone.\n\n6. **If Lewis chased Lewis, then not all donkeys are hungry.**\n   - This statement is conditional. Since Lewis chasing Lewis is not mentioned as happening, we cannot use this to draw any conclusions about the hunger of donkeys.\n\n7. **A human will attack and Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - This tells us that a human (which could be Lewis) will attack, and Hazel did not chase herself.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Lewis will attack.**\n   - From the information given, we know that a human will attack, and Lewis is a human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Lewis and Hazel will attack.**\n   - We only know for sure that a human will attack, and Lewis is a human. There is no information provided about Hazel's behavior, so we cannot conclude that Hazel will attack. Thus, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n3. **Hazel will attack.**\n   - There is no information provided about Hazel's behavior, so we cannot conclude that Hazel will attack. Thus, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n4. **Only humans are hungry and no humans will attack.**\n   - We know that only humans are hungry, but we also know that a human (Lewis) will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Lewis won't attack.**\n   - We know that a human will attack, and Lewis is a human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Only humans are hungry and a human will attack.**\n   - We know that only humans are hungry and that a human (Lewis) will attack. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1. Lewis will attack.\n6. Only humans are hungry and a human will attack.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n**1 and 6 must be true.**",

A human is happy.\n5. A monkey is happy.\n6. Hazel saw Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Statement 1: Every monkey chased a monkey.**\n  - This statement is not necessarily true because the given condition only specifies that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, not that every monkey chased some other monkey. It\u2019s possible for a monkey to chase no other monkeys, as long as it chases itself if it chases anything.\n\n- **Statement 2: No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n  - This statement is not necessarily true. The given condition does not preclude the possibility that a monkey could chase every other monkey. We need more specific information to conclude this.\n\n- **Statement 3: Every monkey chased every monkey.**\n  - This statement is not necessarily true based on the given condition. The condition states that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, but it doesn't imply that every monkey chased every other monkey.\n\n- **Statement 4: A monkey chased every monkey.**\n  - This statement is not necessarily true for the same reason as Statement 3. The condition only specifies that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, not that every monkey chased every other monkey.\n\n- **Statement 5: A monkey chased a monkey.**\n  - This statement must be true. Since every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, and there is at least one monkey, it follows that at least one monkey must have chased another monkey. If no monkey had chased another monkey, then the condition would not hold.\n\n- **Statement 6: A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.**\n  - This statement is true by the given condition. The problem explicitly states that \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 5: A monkey chased a monkey.**\n- **Statement 6: A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**Statements 5 and 6 must be true.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type (donkey, human, monkey).\n3. A human saw Alfred.\n4. A donkey kicked every donkey.\n5. Hazel saw Hazel and no humans will attack.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Statement 3:** \"A human saw Alfred.\"\n  - This means Alfred is either a human or a donkey (since only these two types can be seen by a human). However, we cannot definitively say whether Alfred is a human or a donkey based on this alone.\n\n- **Statement 4:** \"A donkey kicked every donkey.\"\n  - This implies that every donkey is kicking another donkey. However, it does not provide any direct information about attacks or behavior towards humans.\n\n- **Statement 5:** \"Hazel saw Hazel and no humans will attack.\"\n  - Since Hazel saw Hazel, Hazel must be a donkey or a monkey (since a human cannot see themselves). The statement also says no humans will attack, which is consistent with the previous exclusivity of types.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Not all humans will attack.**\n   - We do not have enough information to conclude that not all humans will attack. The statement \"no humans will attack\" is specific to the context where Hazel saw herself, and we cannot generalize this to all humans.\n\n2. **Only humans will attack.**\n   - We know from the statement \"no humans will attack\" that humans will not attack. However, we do not have information about other types (donkeys or monkeys) attacking or not attacking. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - From the information given, we cannot determine whether Alfred will attack or not. Alfred could be a human or a donkey, and neither option provides a definitive answer about his behavior.\n\n4. **Every human will attack.**\n   - We do not have any information that suggests every human will attack. The statement \"no humans will attack\" only applies to the specific scenario where Hazel saw herself.\n\n5. **A human will attack.**\n   - Similar to the previous points, we do not have any information that indicates a human will attack. The statement \"no humans will attack\" specifically negates this possibility.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel will attack.**\n   - As mentioned earlier, we do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred will attack. Additionally, Hazel will not attack according to the given statement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided statements must be true based on the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the statements must be true.**",

The information provided does not directly link Lewis to drinking.\n\n2. **No humans ate if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis.**\n   - From the analysis of Statement 3, we know \\( H \\leftrightarrow D \\). Since \\( H \\leftrightarrow D \\) and \\( \\neg D \\leftrightarrow \\neg K \\), it follows that:\n     - If no humans ate (\\( \\neg H \\)), then not all donkeys drank (\\( \\neg D \\)), which means not all humans kicked Lewis (\\( \\neg K \\)).\n     - Conversely, if not all humans kicked Lewis (\\( \\neg K \\)), then not all donkeys drank (\\( \\neg D \\)), which means no humans ate (\\( \\neg H \\)).\n\n   Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Lewis ate.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, we cannot determine from the given information whether Lewis ate or not.\n\n4. **Lewis didn't eat.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, we cannot determine from the given information whether Lewis ate or not.\n\n5. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - We cannot determine from the given information what Lewis is.

Alfred is asleep only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - From statement 4: \"Alfred is asleep only if Lewis chased Lewis.\"\n   - This means that for Alfred to be asleep, it must be true that Lewis chased Lewis.\n   - However, we have no information about whether Lewis actually chased Lewis or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred is definitely asleep. So, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n2. **Lewis kicked a human.**\n   - From statement 2: \"Every human kicked Lewis.\"\n   - Since every human kicked Lewis, and there is at least one human, it follows that at least one human kicked Lewis. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **A human kicked Lewis.**\n   - This is directly stated in statement 2: \"Every human kicked Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **No humans kicked Lewis.**\n   - This contradicts statement 2, which says every human kicked Lewis. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Lewis kicked every human.**\n   - We know from statement 2 that every human kicked Lewis, but we have no information about whether Lewis kicked any humans.

A human will attack and Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: No humans chased Lewis.\nThis means that no human chased Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 6: A human will attack and Hazel is a monkey.\nSince Hazel is a monkey, and a human will attack, we know that a human will attack. This doesn't provide direct information about who chases whom, but it confirms that a human will indeed attack.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every human kicked every monkey that kicked it.\nThis statement is about the interaction between humans and monkeys, but it doesn't directly affect the chasing behavior.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human saw Hazel or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n- If every human saw Hazel, then the condition is satisfied regardless of what donkeys do.\n- If not every human saw Hazel, then every donkey must have kicked Lewis.\n\nGiven that there's at least one of each type (donkey, human, monkey), and considering the exclusivity, let's assume the second part of the statement holds true for simplicity (since the first part is less restrictive).\n\nSo, if not every human saw Hazel, then every donkey must have kicked Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 5: If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n- If every monkey saw Lewis, then the condition \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n- Since we don't have information about Alfred seeing Alfred, we can't definitively conclude anything from this statement alone.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Lewis chased a human.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that Lewis chased anyone, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n2. **A human chased Lewis.**\n   - We are explicitly told that no humans chased Lewis, so this is false.\n\n3. **Lewis chased every human.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that Lewis chased anyone, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n4. **Every human chased Lewis.**\n   - Again, there is no information suggesting that any human chased Lewis, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n5. **Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n   - Since no humans chased Lewis, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - The statement about Alfred only provides a conditional scenario involving Alfred's actions and does not give us enough information to determine if Alfred will attack.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. A human kicked a donkey that kicked a donkey.\n4. Every monkey kicked Lewis and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n5. Hazel saw Hazel and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **A human kicked a donkey that kicked a donkey.**\n   - This implies there is at least one human and one donkey involved in a sequence of kicking actions. Let's denote the human as \\( H \\) and the donkeys as \\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_2 \\). So, \\( H \\) kicked \\( D_1 \\), and \\( D_1 \\) kicked \\( D_2 \\).\n\n2. **Every monkey kicked Lewis and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This means every monkey is a kicker of Lewis, and Hazel was not seen by any donkey. Therefore, Hazel cannot be a donkey because if Hazel were a donkey, it would have been seen by some donkey, which contradicts the statement.\n\n3. **Hazel saw Hazel and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.**\n   - Since Hazel saw Hazel, Hazel must be a donkey (because only donkeys can see other donkeys, as per the exclusive nature of the categories). However, this directly contradicts the previous point where we concluded Hazel cannot be a donkey. Thus, Hazel must be a human or a monkey.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - From the information that every monkey kicked Lewis, Lewis cannot be a donkey (since monkeys and humans are the only other categories and they would kick a donkey, not another donkey). Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Hazel is a donkey.**\n   - We concluded that Hazel cannot be a donkey due to the contradiction with the statement \"no donkeys saw Hazel.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a donkey.**\n   - This aligns with our conclusion from the previous point. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - The statement \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" does not provide enough information to definitively say Alfred is a donkey. Alfred could be a human or a monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't a donkey.**\n   - Similarly, the statement \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" does not provide enough information to definitively say Alfred is not a donkey. Alfred could be a donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - From the information that every monkey kicked Lewis, Lewis cannot be a donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n3. Hazel isn't a donkey.\n\nThus, the correct answers are:\n1.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Lewis is a donkey.\n4. A donkey saw a human that saw a monkey.\n5. Hazel didn't chase Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n6. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n7. Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, we know Lewis is a donkey.\n- From point 4, a donkey saw a human that saw a monkey. Since Lewis is a donkey, it could be that Lewis saw a human who then saw a monkey. However, we don't have specific identities for these humans and monkeys, only that such a sequence exists.\n- From point 5, Hazel didn't chase Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel. This means there's no direct interaction between Hazel and Lewis.\n- From point 6, not all donkeys chased Alfred. This means some donkeys did not chase Alfred.\n- From point 7, Hazel saw Alfred. This means Hazel and Alfred interacted in some way.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Hazel saw a donkey.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Alfred, but we don't have enough information to conclude that Alfred was a donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - We know a donkey saw a human who saw a monkey, but we don't have any information indicating that a donkey specifically saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that all donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - Similarly, there is no information suggesting that no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - While we can't confirm that all donkeys saw Hazel, we also can't confirm that none of them did. The lack of specific information about what each donkey saw means this statement is not necessarily false, but it is not necessarily true either. However, since we need to identify a statement that must be true, this is a strong candidate.\n\n6. **Hazel saw every donkey.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Alfred, but we don't have any information indicating that Hazel saw every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5. Not all donkeys saw Hazel.**\n\nThis is because we cannot definitively say that all donkeys saw Hazel, nor can we definitively say that none of them did. Therefore, the statement \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is the most logically sound conclusion from the given information.",

A monkey chased a human that chased a donkey.\n5. If Lewis chased Lewis, then Alfred isn't a human.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"There is not a human that every human chased.\"\n- This statement is false because the given information explicitly states that every human chased every human. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"No humans chased a human.\"\n- This statement is false because the given information states that every human chased every human. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"No humans chased a human that chased it.\"\n- To verify this, we need to consider the chase dynamics:\n  - Let's denote a human as \\( H \\) and a donkey as \\( D \\).\n  - According to the given information, a monkey chased a human that chased a donkey.\n  - Let\u2019s assume \\( M \\) (monkey) chased \\( H_1 \\) (human) who chased \\( D \\) (donkey).\n  - Since every human chased every human, \\( H_1 \\) would have chased every human, including itself.\n  - However, the statement says no humans chased a human that chased it, which contradicts the fact that every human chased every human.\n  - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Alfred is a donkey.\"\n- The given information does not provide any specific details about Alfred. We only know that if Lewis chased Lewis, then Alfred isn\u2019t a human. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Alfred is a donkey; he could be a monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"No humans chased every human.\"\n- This statement is false because the given information explicitly states that every human chased every human. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"A human chased every human.\"\n- This statement is true because the given information explicitly states that every human chased every human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**Statement 6: A human chased every human.**\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 6 must be true.**",

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Lewis isn't hungry**:\n   - Similar to the previous point, we do not have enough information to conclude that Lewis is not hungry. Therefore, this statement is also not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis is a monkey**:\n   - Since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and we know that Lewis did not eat, and since all monkeys ate, Lewis cannot be a monkey because he did not eat.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Every human is asleep just in case no donkeys will attack.\n4. A human will attack but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.\n5. Every monkey drank and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: \"A human will attack but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.\"\n- This means that Alfred is asleep because if Alfred were awake, then a human would not attack according to statement 3.\n- Therefore, Alfred is asleep.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Every monkey drank and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n- This means that some donkeys did not kick Alfred, implying that at least one donkey did not kick Alfred.\n\n### Evaluating Each Option:\n\n1. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - From statement 3, we know Alfred is asleep. Since a human will attack only if they are not asleep, and Alfred is asleep, Alfred will not attack.\n   - **False.**\n\n2. **Alfred drank.**\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred drinking. The only information about drinking is that every monkey drank, but nothing is said about Alfred.\n   - **Cannot be determined.**\n\n3. **A human will attack and every monkey drank.**\n   - We established that Alfred is asleep, so a human will attack.\n   - We also know from the given information that every monkey drank.\n   - **True.**\n\n4. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred drinking. The only information about drinking is that every monkey drank, but nothing is said about Alfred.\n   - **Cannot be determined.**\n\n5. **Alfred won't attack.**\n   - As established, Alfred is asleep, and since a human will attack only if they are not asleep, Alfred will not attack.\n   - **True.**\n\n6. **Every monkey drank and no humans will attack.**\n   - We know every monkey drank, but we also know that a human will attack because Alfred is asleep.\n   - **False.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **3. A human will attack and every monkey drank.**\n- **5. Alfred won't attack.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**3 and 5 must be true.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys chased a monkey.\n3. A monkey kicked a monkey that kicked a donkey.\n4. No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Hazel doesn't see Alfred.\n5. If every monkey chased Lewis, then a monkey chased Hazel.\n6. If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys chased a monkey.\nThis means that no donkey chased any monkey.\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey kicked a monkey that kicked a donkey.\nThis implies that there is a chain of events where a monkey kicked another monkey, and that monkey then kicked a donkey. This does not provide direct information about chasing but confirms the existence of interactions between monkeys and donkeys.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Hazel doesn't see Alfred.\nThis means that if Hazel sees Alfred, no donkey can kick Alfred. If Hazel doesn't see Alfred, then some donkey might kick Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 5: If every monkey chased Lewis, then a monkey chased Hazel.\nIf every monkey chased Lewis, then it follows that at least one monkey chased Hazel. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that every monkey chased Hazel; it just means that if the condition is met, then a monkey chased Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 6: If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\nThis is a conditional statement. It tells us that if every monkey saw Lewis, then either not all donkeys kicked Alfred or Alfred kicked Hazel (or both).\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - From Statement 2, we know no donkeys chased a monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n   - We have no information that suggests any specific donkey was chased by every monkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, we have no information that any donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - Again, we have no information that supports this claim. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n5. **Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - We have no information that supports this claim. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - Since no donkeys chased any monkey (from Statement 2), it logically follows that no donkeys chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n\nFinal Answer: **6. No donkeys chased every monkey.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n3. A monkey chased Alfred.\n4. Every human is happy.\n5. If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every human saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Alfred and Lewis are humans because they are mentioned in the context of seeing and being seen.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the happiness of humans\n- From point 2, we know that a human is happy. Since Alfred and Lewis are humans, at least one of them is happy.\n- From point 4, every human is happy. Therefore, both Alfred and Lewis are happy.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the condition involving Alfred, Lewis, and Hazel\n- Point 2 states: \"A human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n  - This means Lewis sees Hazel.\n- Point 5 states: \"If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every human saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n  - Since Alfred and Lewis are both humans, and we already established that Lewis sees Hazel, the condition about Alfred not seeing Lewis does not apply here.\n  - Therefore, the condition simplifies to: \"Every human saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nSince we have no information about monkeys kicking Hazel, we can assume the condition holds true, meaning every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n1. **Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n   - We established that both Alfred and Lewis are humans and every human is happy.\n   - **True.**\n\n2. **A monkey is happy and every human chased Alfred.**\n   - We have no information about the happiness of the monkey.\n   - We know a monkey chased Alfred, but we have no information about whether every human chased Alfred.\n   - **False.**\n\n3. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - We established that Alfred is a human and every human is happy.\n   - **True.**\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel are happy.**\n   - We established that Alfred is happy.\n   - We also established that every human saw Hazel, so Hazel is happy.\n   - **True.**\n\n5. **Alfred isn't happy.**\n   - We established that Alfred is happy.\n   - **False.**\n\n6. **A human is happy and a monkey chased Alfred.**\n   - We established that Alfred is a human and every human is happy.\n   - We know a monkey chased Alfred.\n   - **True.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1.

Every human is asleep just in case not all humans kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"A donkey kicked every human.\"\n- This statement directly follows from the second piece of information provided. It means that for every human, there exists at least one donkey that kicked them. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 1: \"No donkeys kicked a human.\"\n- This contradicts statement 2. If no donkeys kicked a human, then it would be false that a donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Every donkey kicked every human.\"\n- While it is true that a donkey kicked every human, we do not have enough information to conclude that every single donkey kicked every single human. The original statement only says that every human was kicked by at least one donkey, not necessarily every donkey. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"A donkey kicked a human.\"\n- This is a weaker form of statement 2. Since a donkey kicked every human, it is certainly true that at least one donkey kicked at least one human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"No donkeys kicked every human.\"\n- This is the negation of statement 2. Since statement 2 is true, its negation cannot be true. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"There is a donkey that every human kicked.\"\n- This is a stronger form of statement 2. While statement 2 guarantees that every human was kicked by at least one donkey, it does not guarantee that there is a single donkey that kicked every human. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 2: A donkey kicked every human.**\n- **Statement 4: A donkey kicked a human.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that statements 2 and 4 must be true.",

Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **Alfred chased Hazel.**\n   - We do not have any information about Alfred chasing Hazel. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Alfred will run.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred will run or not. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3. Hazel chased Alfred.**\n\nFinal Answer: 3.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. Every monkey chased a donkey.\n4. A monkey saw a human that saw a human.\n5. If Alfred ate, then a human chased Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey chased a donkey. This means that for every monkey \\(M\\), there exists a donkey \\(D\\) such that \\(M\\) chased \\(D\\). This directly implies statement 1: \"A monkey chased a donkey\" is true.\n\nNow let's analyze the other statements:\n\n- **Statement 2:** \"A donkey chased a monkey.\"\n  - The given information does not provide any direct relationship between donkeys chasing monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n- **Statement 3:** \"A donkey chased every monkey.\"\n  - Again, the given information does not provide any direct relationship indicating that a single donkey chased all monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n- **Statement 4:** \"Every donkey chased a monkey.\"\n  - Similar to the previous statements, the given information does not provide any direct relationship indicating that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n- **Statement 5:** \"Every donkey chased every monkey.\"\n  - As with the previous statements, the given information does not provide any direct relationship indicating that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n- **Statement 6:** \"No donkeys chased every monkey.\"\n  - Since we cannot conclude that every donkey chased every monkey (as per the analysis of statement 5), it logically follows that no donkeys chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 1: A monkey chased a donkey.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 1 must be true.",

It is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred (which means Alfred chased Alfred).\n6. Not all monkeys ate just in case a human saw Hazel.\n7. Every monkey chased Hazel just in case not all humans kicked Lewis.\n8. If a human chased Lewis, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From statement 2: No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- From statement 4: Hazel saw Hazel.\n- From statement 5: Alfred chased Alfred (this does not directly affect our analysis).\n\nNow, let's focus on the implications of the other statements:\n\n- Statement 3: Every monkey kicked Lewis. This means that if something is a monkey, it kicked Lewis.\n- Statement 7: Every monkey chased Hazel just in case not all humans kicked Lewis. Since we know from statement 2 that no donkeys kicked Hazel, and since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, it follows that not all humans kicked Lewis. Therefore, every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - We already know from statement 2 that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - The statement \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" could be true, but it is not necessarily implied by the given information. There could be some donkeys who saw Hazel, so this statement is not definitively true.\n\n2. **If every donkey saw Hazel, then a donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - This statement is false because we know from statement 2 that no donkeys kicked Hazel, regardless of whether they saw Hazel or not.\n\n3. **No donkeys kicked Hazel and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - We know from statement 2 that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - However, statement 4 tells us that Hazel saw Hazel, so this statement is false.\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked Hazel and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - We know from statement 2 that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - Statement 4 confirms that Hazel saw Hazel.\n   - This statement is true based on the given information.\n\n5. **No donkeys kicked Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - We know from statement 2 that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - However, statement 4 tells us that Hazel saw Hazel, which means at least one donkey (Hazel) saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - We know from statement 2 that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - However, statement 4 tells us that Hazel saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4.

However, based on the third piece of information, if a monkey saw something, every human saw it. Therefore, if a monkey saw a particular thing, every human saw it, meaning every human did see every monkey that saw something. So, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A human saw every monkey that saw it.**\n   - This is directly supported by the third piece of information. If a monkey saw something, every human saw it. So, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Every human saw every monkey.**\n   - We cannot conclude this from the given information. The third piece of information only states that if a monkey saw something, every human saw it, but it does not say that every human saw every monkey directly. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A human saw a monkey.**\n   - Since there is at least one monkey and every human saw every monkey that saw something, and since there is at least one of each type, it is certain that at least one human saw at least one monkey. So, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Every human saw a monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, we cannot conclude this from the given information. While it is possible that every human saw a monkey, we do not have enough information to guarantee this.

Every donkey saw Hazel only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 1, we know the universe consists of donkeys, humans, and monkeys, with at least one of each.\n- Point 3 tells us that for every monkey \\(M\\), there exists a donkey \\(D\\) such that \\(M\\) chased \\(D\\).\n- Point 4 indicates a chain of actions involving humans: a human \\(H_1\\) kicked another human \\(H_2\\), who in turn kicked a monkey \\(M\\).\n- Point 5 states that for every donkey \\(D\\), \\(D\\) saw Hazel only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - This means there is at least one monkey that no donkey chased. However, from point 3, we know every monkey was chased by some donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **No donkeys chased a monkey.**\n   - This would mean no donkey chased any monkey, which contradicts point 3. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This would imply that for every pair of donkey and monkey, the donkey chased the monkey. However, point 3 only guarantees that every monkey was chased by some donkey, not necessarily every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - This means every donkey chased at least one monkey. While point 3 guarantees that every monkey was chased by some donkey, it does not specify that every donkey chased a specific monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, this would mean every donkey chased every monkey. Again, point 3 only guarantees that every monkey was chased by some donkey, not necessarily every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - This is consistent with point 3, which states that every monkey was chased by some donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. A donkey chased a monkey.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A human saw a monkey that saw a monkey.\n3. Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n4. No donkeys saw Hazel.\n5. No donkeys kicked Alfred unless every donkey will attack.\n6. Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n7. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: A human saw a monkey that saw a monkey.\n- This implies there is a chain of sight: Human -> Monkey -> Monkey.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n- This is a tautology and doesn't provide new information about the relationships between entities.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys saw Hazel.\n- This means Hazel is not seen by any donkeys.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n- This can be rephrased as: If Hazel is not a human, then every donkey saw Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 7: If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n- This statement involves conditional logic. Let's break it down:\n  - If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then:\n    - Either all donkeys did kick Alfred, or some donkeys did not kick Alfred.\n    - If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Every donkey saw a human.**\n   - There is no direct evidence from the given statements that every donkey saw a human. We know a human saw a monkey, but we don't have information about whether every donkey saw a human.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw a human.**\n   - This is also not necessarily true. The fact that a human saw a monkey does not preclude the possibility that some donkeys might have seen a human.\n\n3. **No donkeys saw every human.**\n   - This is a stronger claim than what we can infer. We know no donkeys saw Hazel, but we don't have enough information to conclude that no donkeys saw every human.\n\n4. **A donkey saw a human.**\n   - This could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information. We know a human saw a monkey, but we don't know if any donkey saw that human.\n\n5. **Every donkey saw every human.**\n   - This is an overstatement. We know no donkeys saw Hazel, so it cannot be true that every donkey saw every human.\n\n6. **A donkey saw every human.**\n   - Similar to statement 5, this is an overstatement. We know no donkeys saw Hazel, so it cannot be true that a donkey saw every human.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided statements must be true based on the given information.

So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - This is a contradiction. It cannot be both true that not all donkeys will run and that every donkey will run simultaneously. So, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys are happy.**\n   - We have no direct information about the happiness of donkeys. However, since not all monkeys will run (statement 2) and every monkey will run unless every donkey is happy (statement 4), it follows that not all donkeys are happy. This must be true.\n\n4. **No donkeys are happy.**\n   - We do not have enough information to conclude that no donkeys are happy. It could be that some are happy and some are not. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Only donkeys are happy.**\n   - Again, we do not have enough information to conclude that only donkeys are happy. There could be other entities (humans or monkeys) that are also happy. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred will run.**\n   - From statement 5, if Alfred is a human, then no donkeys are happy. However, we do not have information about Alfred being a human or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say Alfred will run.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every monkey saw a human.\n4. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n5. A monkey kicked Alfred.\n6. Alfred isn't a human unless every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey saw a human. This means that for every monkey \\(M\\), there exists a human \\(H\\) such that \\(M\\) saw \\(H\\). Therefore, statement 2 \"A monkey saw a human\" must be true.\n\nNow let's evaluate the other statements:\n\n- **Statement 1: No humans saw every monkey.**\n  - We know from point 3 that every monkey saw a human. However, this does not imply that no human saw every monkey. It only tells us that every individual monkey was seen by at least one human. So, it is possible that some humans saw all monkeys. Therefore, statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 2: A monkey saw a human.**\n  - This is directly stated in point 3. Therefore, statement 2 is true.\n\n- **Statement 3: Every human saw a monkey.**\n  - The information provided does not indicate that every human saw every monkey. It only states that every monkey saw a human. Therefore, statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 4: A human saw every monkey.**\n  - Similar to statement 3, the information does not support this. It only states that every monkey saw a human, not that a specific human saw every monkey. Therefore, statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 5: Every human saw every monkey.**\n  - Again, the information does not support this. It only states that every monkey saw a human, not that every human saw every monkey. Therefore, statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 6: A human saw a monkey.**\n  - Since every monkey saw a human (point 3), it follows that at least one human saw at least one monkey. Therefore, statement 6 is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- Statement 2: A monkey saw a human.\n- Statement 6: A human saw a monkey.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**Statements 2 and 6 must be true.**",

No humans are asleep only if Hazel didn't chase Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **A monkey chased Alfred.**\n   - From point 2, we know that every monkey chased Alfred. Since there is at least one monkey, it follows that a monkey did indeed chase Alfred.\n   - **True.**\n\n2. **Alfred chased a monkey.**\n   - There is no direct statement about Alfred chasing a monkey. The information provided does not give us any indication that Alfred chased any monkey.\n   - **False.**\n\n3. **Not all monkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - From point 2, we know that every monkey chased Alfred. Therefore, it cannot be true that not all monkeys chased Alfred.\n   - **False.**\n\n4. **No monkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This directly contradicts point 2, which states that every monkey chased Alfred.\n   - **False.**\n\n5. **Alfred chased every monkey.**\n   - There is no information provided that suggests Alfred chased any monkeys. In fact, the information given does not mention Alfred chasing any monkeys.\n   - **False.**\n\n6. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey chased Alfred.**\n   - This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n     - \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred\" is always true because an entity cannot chase itself.\n     - \"A monkey chased Alfred\" is true based on point 2.\n   - Both parts of the statement are true, so the entire statement is true.\n   - **True.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1. A monkey chased Alfred.\n6. Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey chased Alfred.\n\nSo, the final answer is: **1 and 6**.",

No donkeys kicked Alfred unless not all donkeys will attack.\n4. If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\n5. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n6. Alfred isn't hungry and Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Every donkey kicked every monkey.\"\n- From point 2, we know there is a monkey that every donkey kicked. This does not necessarily mean that every donkey kicked every monkey. It could be that some donkeys did not kick certain monkeys, as long as there is at least one monkey that every donkey kicked. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\n- This directly contradicts the given information in point 2, which states that there is a monkey that every donkey kicked. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"A donkey kicked a monkey.\"\n- Since there is a monkey that every donkey kicked (point 2), it follows that at least one donkey kicked at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"There is a donkey that every monkey kicked.\"\n- The given information only tells us that there is a specific monkey that every donkey kicked, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"A donkey kicked a monkey.\"\n- As explained above, since there is a monkey that every donkey kicked, it follows that at least one donkey kicked at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- **Statement 4: A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n- **Statement 6: A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n\nThus, the correct answer is that both statements 4 and 6 must be true.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every donkey saw Hazel.\n3. Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n4. Only humans drank.\n5. Not all donkeys saw Lewis only if not all donkeys are hungry.\n6. If every monkey chased Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\n7. Alfred isn't hungry.\n8. It is not the case that Lewis drank.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"Hazel is a donkey.\"\n- From statement 2, we know that every donkey saw Hazel. This means Hazel could be a donkey, but we need more information to confirm this.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Alfred drank.\"\n- From statement 4, only humans drank. Since Alfred isn't mentioned as a human, and we have no other information about Alfred drinking, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Hazel isn't a donkey.\"\n- From statement 2, if Hazel is a donkey, then every donkey saw her. However, statement 3 says Hazel doesn't see herself, which is consistent with her being a donkey because she would see herself if she were a donkey. Therefore, Hazel must be a donkey for this to hold true. So, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Alfred and Hazel drank.\"\n- From statement 4, only humans drank. Since Alfred isn't a human, he did not drink. Hazel is a donkey, so she also did not drink. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Alfred didn't drink.\"\n- From statement 4, only humans drank. Since Alfred isn't a human, he did not drink. This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Alfred and Lewis drank.\"\n- From statement 4, only humans drank. Since Alfred isn't a human, he did not drink. We also know from statement 8 that Lewis did not drink. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred didn't drink.**\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 5 must be true.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: donkey, human, and monkey.\n3. No monkeys chased Lewis.\n4. A human is happy and Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n5. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n6. Alfred is happy.\n7. If every monkey is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4, we know that a human is happy and Lewis didn't kick Alfred. Since Alfred is mentioned as being happy in point 6, Alfred must be a human.\n- From point 5, no donkeys kicked Hazel. This means that Hazel was not kicked by any donkeys.\n- Point 7 states that if every monkey is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel. However, since no donkeys kicked Hazel (point 5), this condition is automatically satisfied regardless of whether every monkey is asleep or not. Therefore, the condition about Alfred not kicking Hazel is always true under these circumstances.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n   - We have no direct information about whether Alfred or Hazel are asleep. The only information we have is about what they did or did not do, not their state of being asleep. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n2. **Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, we have no direct information about Alfred's state of being asleep. Therefore, this statement also cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n3. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n   - Again, we have no direct information about whether Alfred or Lewis are asleep. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked Hazel and every human is happy.**\n   - We know from point 5 that no donkeys kicked Hazel. And from point 4, we know that a human (Alfred) is happy. Therefore, this statement is true based on the given information.\n\n5. **A human is happy and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - We know from point 4 that a human (Alfred) is happy, and from point 5 that no donkeys kicked Hazel. Therefore, this statement is true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - We have no direct information about whether Alfred is asleep. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- **Statement 4: No donkeys kicked Hazel and every human is happy.**\n- **Statement 5: A human is happy and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n\nHowever, since the question asks for which statement must be true, and both 4 and 5 are true, we can select either one. For the sake of providing a single answer, we will choose:\n\n**Final Answer: 4. No donkeys kicked Hazel and every human is happy.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every donkey chased every monkey.\n3. A monkey chased a human that chased a donkey.\n4. If a monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred is asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\"\n- From point 2, we know that every donkey chased every monkey. This means for any given monkey, it was chased by all donkeys. Therefore, statement 1 is true.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\"\n- The given information does not provide any direct evidence about whether every monkey chased every donkey. It only states that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that every monkey chased every donkey. Statement 2 is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"No donkeys chased every monkey.\"\n- This is the negation of statement 1. Since statement 1 is true, statement 3 must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"There is not a donkey that every monkey chased.\"\n- This is the same as statement 3, which we have already determined to be false. Therefore, statement 4 is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Every donkey chased a monkey.\"\n- From point 2, we know that every donkey chased every monkey. This implies that every donkey chased at least one monkey (in fact, every monkey). Therefore, statement 5 is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"No donkeys chased a monkey.\"\n- This directly contradicts point 2, which states that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, statement 6 is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1. There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n5. Every donkey chased a monkey.\n\nSo, the final answer is: **Statements 1 and 5 must be true.**",

Hazel is happy just in case a human saw Hazel.\n5. Not all humans will run.\n6. It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n7. Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n8. Every donkey will run.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 6, we know \\( \\neg (\\text{Lewis is a donkey}) \\). This means Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n- From point 8, since every donkey will run, and from point 6, Lewis cannot be a donkey, so Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n- From point 3, for a monkey to see Alfred, a donkey must have seen Lewis. Since Lewis is not a donkey, no donkey can see Lewis, and thus no monkey can see Alfred. Therefore, no monkey sees Alfred.\n- From point 2, Alfred didn't chase Alfred, which is trivially true and doesn't provide new information.\n- From point 7, Hazel didn't chase Hazel, which is also trivially true and doesn't provide new information.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - We already established that Lewis is not a donkey.\n   - Whether not all donkeys chased Alfred is not directly supported by the given information. The information does not specify whether any donkeys chased Alfred or not.\n   - **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n2. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - Alfred didn't chase Alfred is trivially true.\n   - But from point 6, we know \\( \\neg (\\text{Lewis is a donkey}) \\), meaning it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n   - **This statement is false.**\n\n3. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred and Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - As previously determined, Lewis is not a donkey.\n   - **This statement is false.**\n\n4. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - Alfred didn't chase Alfred is trivially true.\n   - From point 6, we know \\( \\neg (\\text{Lewis is a donkey}) \\).\n   - **This statement is true.**\n\n5. **If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.**\n   - The condition \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is not specified as true or false.\n   - Whether Lewis chased Lewis is not directly related to the chasing behavior of donkeys.\n   - **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n6. **No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.**\n   - The condition \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is not specified as true or false.\n   - Whether Lewis chased Lewis is not directly related to the chasing behavior of donkeys.\n   - **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4.

The statement implies that for every human \\(h \\in H\\), there exists a monkey \\(m \\in M\\) such that \\(m\\) saw \\(h\\).\n\n3. **Hazel chased every donkey.**\n   - Let's denote Hazel as \\(Z\\). The statement implies that for every donkey \\(d \\in D\\), \\(Z\\) chased \\(d\\).\n\n4. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a paradoxical statement. It can be interpreted as a contradiction because it states that the negation of being a human (i.e., not being a human) is equivalent to being a human. Therefore, the only way this can be logically consistent is if Hazel is indeed a human. So, \\(Z \\in H\\).\n\n5. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n   - Since we've established that \\(Z \\in H\\), a human saw Hazel. Therefore, Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n\n6. **A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - The first part is irrelevant to our logical deductions. The second part reiterates that Hazel did chase herself, which is trivially true since Hazel is a human and the statement about chasing donkeys applies to her as well.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. **Every monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - We know that a monkey saw every human, and Hazel is a human. However, we do not have direct information that every monkey saw Hazel specifically. This statement might be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Hazel saw every monkey.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Hazel saw any monkeys. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - There is no information provided that suggests some monkeys did not see Hazel. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n4. **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - There is no information provided that suggests no monkeys saw Hazel. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n5. **Hazel saw a monkey.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Hazel saw any monkeys. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n6. **A monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - Since a monkey saw every human and Hazel is a human, it follows that at least one monkey saw Hazel. This statement must be true.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. A monkey saw Hazel.**",

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, while every human was kicked by some donkey, it does not imply that every donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is also not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n   - The second piece of information states that every human was kicked by some donkey, but it does not specify that every donkey kicked a human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked a human.**\n   - This directly contradicts the second piece of information, which states that every human was kicked by some donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked a human.**\n   - Since every human was kicked by some donkey, it follows that at least one donkey kicked at least one human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true because it is possible that some donkeys kicked all humans, even though not all donkeys may have done so.

However, this does not directly affect the core relationships among donkeys, humans, and monkeys.\n\n4. **If every monkey kicked Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This indicates that if all monkeys kicked Lewis, then all monkeys also saw Lewis. This is a conditional statement about the actions of monkeys.\n\n5. **A human saw Lewis and not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This tells us that at least one human saw Lewis, and not all donkeys chased Alfred.

A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel. This means that Hazel was not kicked by any donkey.\n- From point 4, every human chased Alfred. Since there is at least one human, let's denote this human as \\( H \\).\n- From point 5, a human is happy if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred. Since every human chased Alfred, it follows that no donkeys chased Alfred for the human to be happy. Therefore, Alfred is happy.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Every donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - We know from point 3 that no donkeys kicked Hazel. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Hazel kicked every donkey.**\n   - There is no information provided about Hazel kicking any donkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - As established, since every human chased Alfred, no donkeys chased Alfred, making Alfred happy. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - Since no donkeys kicked Hazel (from point 3), it is true that not all donkeys kicked Hazel. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - We know from point 3 that no donkeys kicked Hazel. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Hazel kicked a donkey.**\n   - There is no information provided about Hazel kicking any donkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- Alfred is happy.\n- Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n3. Alfred is happy.\n4. Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n3. No donkeys saw every monkey.\n4. There is a human that every donkey chased.\n5. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\n6. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n7. Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Statement 1**: This sets up the universe of discourse as consisting exclusively of donkeys, humans, and monkeys.\n2. **Statement 2**: This means that not all donkeys kicked Alfred. So, some donkeys did not kick Alfred.\n3. **Statement 3**: This means that no single donkey saw every monkey. At least one monkey was not seen by every donkey.\n4. **Statement 4**: There exists at least one human that every donkey chased. Let's call this human \"Human X\".\n5. **Statement 5**: This is a conditional statement. It can be broken into two parts:\n   - If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis.\n   - If every human saw Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis.\n6. **Statement 6**: Not all donkeys chased Alfred. So, some donkeys did not chase Alfred.\n7. **Statement 7**: Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n### Evaluating Each Option:\n1. **A donkey chased a human**:\n   - From Statement 4, we know that every donkey chased Human X. Therefore, at least one donkey chased a human (Human X).\n   - This statement must be true.\n\n2. **There is a donkey that every human chased**:\n   - We do not have enough information to conclude that any specific donkey chased every human. The statement that every donkey chased Human X does not imply that every human was chased by the same donkey.\n   - This statement may or may not be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased every human**:\n   - Similar to option 2, we cannot conclude from the given information that every donkey chased every human.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased a human**:\n   - From Statement 4, we know that every donkey chased Human X. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every human**:\n   - As mentioned earlier, we do not have enough information to conclude that any specific donkey chased every human.\n   - This statement may or may not be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased every human**:\n   - Since we know that every donkey chased Human X, it is possible that some donkeys did not chase other humans. However, we cannot definitively say that no donkeys chased every human without more information.\n   - This statement may or may not be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. A donkey chased a human.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **1. A donkey chased a human.**",
