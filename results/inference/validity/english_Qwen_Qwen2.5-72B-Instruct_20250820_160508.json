Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"There is a donkey that every monkey saw.\"\n- The given information does not provide any information about monkeys seeing donkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"A donkey saw every monkey.\"\n- Similar to Statement 1, the given information only states that every donkey saw a monkey, not necessarily every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"No donkeys saw every monkey.\"\n- This is the negation of Statement 5. Since Statement 5 is not necessarily true, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4.

However, the problem does not provide information about whether the monkeys saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, the problem does not provide information about whether the monkeys saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n5. **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This statement contradicts the possibility that at least one monkey might have seen Hazel. Since the problem does not provide information about whether the monkeys saw Hazel, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a monkey.**\n   - The problem states that Hazel saw every monkey.

Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the implications of \"Hazel isn't a human just in case not all humans saw Hazel.\"\n- This statement can be interpreted as: If not all humans saw Hazel, then Hazel is not a human.\n- Conversely, if Hazel is a human, then all humans saw Hazel.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statement \"Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n- This means that every monkey ate, and Hazel saw herself.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine Hazel's identity.\n- Since Hazel saw herself, we need to consider the implications for each possible identity:\n  - **If Hazel is a donkey:** Donkeys do not have any specific conditions mentioned, so this is possible.\n  - **If Hazel is a human:** All humans saw Hazel, which means Hazel saw herself, which is consistent.\n  - **If Hazel is a monkey:** Monkeys ate, and Hazel saw herself, which is also consistent.\n\nHowever, the statement \"Hazel isn't a human just in case not all humans saw Hazel\" provides a crucial clue:\n- If Hazel is a human, then all humans saw Hazel.\n- If not all humans saw Hazel, then Hazel is not a human.\n\nSince Hazel saw herself, it implies that either:\n- Hazel is a human and all humans saw her, or\n- Hazel is not a human (either a donkey or a monkey).\n\nGiven that there is at least one of each type, and the statement \"Not all humans will run\" suggests that there are multiple humans with different behaviors, it is more likely that Hazel is not a human. Therefore, Hazel is either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the statements:\n1. **Not all monkeys will run and only humans ate.**\n   - We know every monkey ate, but we don't have information about whether all monkeys will run or not.\n   - We also don't have information about who else ate besides monkeys.\n   - This statement cannot be definitively true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Hazel will run.**\n   - We don't have information about whether Hazel will run or not.\n   - This statement cannot be definitively true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Every monkey ate and not all humans will run.**\n   - We know every monkey ate.\n   - We also know not all humans will run.\n   - This statement is true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Every monkey ate and no humans will run.**\n   - We know every monkey ate.\n   - However, we only know that not all humans will run, not that no humans will run.\n   - This statement cannot be definitively true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Hazel ate.**\n   - If Hazel is a monkey, she ate because every monkey ate.\n   - If Hazel is a donkey, we don't have information about whether donkeys ate.\n   - This statement cannot be definitively true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Hazel won't run.**\n   - We don't have information about whether Hazel will run or not.\n   - This statement cannot be definitively true based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3.

A human chased a donkey that chased it.\n6. Hazel isn't a human only if every monkey chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys chased Lewis.\nThis means that if \\( D \\) represents a donkey, then \\( D \\) did not chase Lewis. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human chased a donkey that chased it.\nLet's denote:\n- \\( H \\) as a human.\n- \\( D_1 \\) as a donkey that was chased by \\( H \\).\n- \\( D_2 \\) as a donkey that chased \\( H \\).\n\nFrom the statement, we have:\n- \\( H \\) chased \\( D_1 \\).\n- \\( D_2 \\) chased \\( H \\).\n\nSince no donkeys chased Lewis (Statement 3), \\( D_2 \\) cannot be Lewis. Therefore, \\( D_2 \\) must be a different donkey.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel isn't a human only if every monkey chased Lewis.\nThis can be interpreted as:\n- If Hazel is not a human, then every monkey chased Lewis.\n- If Hazel is a human, then it does not necessarily mean that every monkey chased Lewis.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - From Statement 3, no donkeys chased Lewis. If Lewis were a donkey, he would not have chased himself, which is consistent with the information. However, this does not necessarily mean Lewis must be a donkey. He could also be a human or a monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Lewis chased every donkey.**\n   - This is not supported by the given information. We know that no donkeys chased Lewis, but we do not have information about whether Lewis chased any donkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis chased a donkey.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, we do not have information about whether Lewis chased any donkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys chased Lewis.**\n   - This is true because Statement 3 explicitly states that no donkeys chased Lewis. Therefore, it is impossible for all donkeys to have chased Lewis. This statement must be true.\n\n5. **Every donkey chased Lewis.**\n   - This is false because Statement 3 explicitly states that no donkeys chased Lewis.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze it step by step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. There is a donkey that every human kicked.\n3. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. A human saw Lewis and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the entities and their relationships\n- **Entities**: Donkeys, Humans, Monkeys\n- **At least one of each**: This means there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- **Donkey that every human kicked**: There exists a specific donkey that was kicked by every human.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the conditional statement\n- **If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel**:\n  - This is a complex conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n    - **Lewis didn't chase Lewis**: This is always true because it's a self-referential statement (no one can chase themselves).\n    - **Not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel**: Since the antecedent (Lewis didn't chase Lewis) is always true, the entire conditional statement simplifies to:\n      - **Not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel**.\n    - This means that if no monkeys kicked Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel. Conversely, if all donkeys kicked Hazel, then some monkeys must have kicked Hazel.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the observation\n- **A human saw Lewis and only donkeys are asleep**:\n  - This implies that Lewis is either a human or a monkey (since only donkeys are asleep and Lewis is not asleep).\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **A human kicked a donkey**:\n   - True. The statement \"There is a donkey that every human kicked\" directly implies that every human kicked at least one donkey.\n\n2. **A donkey kicked a human**:\n   - Not necessarily true. The given information does not provide any direct evidence that a donkey kicked a human.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked every human**:\n   - Not necessarily true. The given information only states that there is a specific donkey that every human kicked, not that every donkey kicked every human.\n\n4. **Every donkey kicked a human**:\n   - Not necessarily true. The given information only states that there is a specific donkey that every human kicked, not that every donkey kicked at least one human.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked every human**:\n   - Not necessarily true. The given information only states that there is a specific donkey that every human kicked, not that a single donkey kicked every human.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked every human**:\n   - Not necessarily true. The given information does not provide any direct evidence that no donkeys kicked every human.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. **A human kicked a donkey**.",

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey chased Alfred**:\n   - We know that Alfred did chase Alfred. Therefore, the first part of this statement is false, making the entire statement false.\n\n4. **A monkey chased Alfred**:\n   - This is true because every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n5. **Alfred chased every monkey**:\n   - We do not have enough information to determine if Alfred chased every monkey.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A donkey chased every human.\n3. Every donkey is happy or every donkey chased Alfred.\n4. No donkeys are happy or every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the implications of the statements.\n- **Statement 2**: \"A donkey chased every human.\"\n  - This means that for every human, there exists at least one donkey that chased them.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Every donkey is happy or every donkey chased Alfred.\"\n  - This can be interpreted as: If not every donkey is happy, then every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"No donkeys are happy or every donkey chased Alfred.\"\n  - This can be interpreted as: If no donkeys are happy, then every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n#### Step 2: Combine the implications of Statements 3 and 4.\n- From Statement 3: If not every donkey is happy, then every donkey chased Alfred.\n- From Statement 4: If no donkeys are happy, then every donkey chased Alfred.\n\nSince \"no donkeys are happy\" implies \"not every donkey is happy,\" we can combine these two statements to conclude:\n- If no donkeys are happy, then every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the possible scenarios.\n- **Scenario 1**: No donkeys are happy.\n  - In this case, from the combined statement, every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Some donkeys are happy.\n  - In this case, from Statement 3, every donkey is happy or every donkey chased Alfred. Since some donkeys are happy, the condition \"every donkey is happy\" is satisfied, and we do not need to consider the \"every donkey chased Alfred\" part.\n\nHowever, since Statement 4 states \"No donkeys are happy or every donkey chased Alfred,\" and we are considering the scenario where some donkeys are happy, this scenario contradicts Statement 4. Therefore, Scenario 2 is not possible.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n- The only consistent scenario is Scenario 1, where no donkeys are happy, and every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n1. Every donkey chased Alfred.",

It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n5. No humans are asleep only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n6. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n7. Only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the type of Alfred and Lewis\n- **Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This implies Alfred cannot be a donkey because donkeys chase humans, and Alfred would have to be a human to avoid chasing himself. Therefore, Alfred is either a human or a monkey.\n- **It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey**: This means Lewis is a donkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the chasing behavior\n- **Every donkey chased every human**: Since Lewis is a donkey, he must have chased every human.\n- **Not all donkeys chased Alfred**: Since Lewis is a donkey and did not chase Alfred, Alfred cannot be a human (because if Alfred were a human, Lewis would have chased him). Therefore, Alfred must be a monkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the sleep conditions\n- **Only donkeys are asleep**: This means no humans or monkeys are asleep.\n- **No humans are asleep only if not all monkeys chased Lewis**: Since no humans are asleep (as only donkeys are asleep), it must be the case that not all monkeys chased Lewis. Since Alfred is a monkey and did not chase Lewis, this condition is satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Alfred is a monkey.\n- Lewis is a donkey.\n- No humans are asleep.\n- Only donkeys are asleep.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Alfred isn't a human**: True (Alfred is a monkey).\n2. **Alfred is asleep**: False (only donkeys are asleep, and Alfred is a monkey).\n3. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep**: False (Alfred is not asleep, and Lewis is a donkey, so he might be asleep, but we don't need to determine his sleep status for this statement to be false).\n4. **Alfred is a human**: False (Alfred is a monkey).\n5. **Lewis is asleep**: Possible (since only donkeys are asleep, and Lewis is a donkey, he could be asleep, but we don't have enough information to confirm this definitively).\n6. **Alfred isn't asleep**: True (Alfred is a monkey, and only donkeys are asleep).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Alfred doesn't see Alfred.\n3. If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if Lewis is a donkey.\n4. A human saw Lewis.\n5. Hazel saw Hazel.\n6. Alfred isn't asleep.\n7. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the types of Alfred, Lewis, and Hazel\n- **Alfred**: Since Alfred isn't asleep, Alfred cannot be a monkey (because monkeys can be asleep).\n- **Lewis**: A human saw Lewis, so Lewis cannot be a donkey (since donkeys are not seen by humans).\n- **Hazel**: Hazel saw Hazel, which means Hazel is a human (since only humans can see themselves).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the implications of the given conditions\n- **Condition 3**: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if Lewis is a donkey.\"\n  - Since Lewis is not a donkey (from Step 1), this condition simplifies to: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is not asleep.\"\n  - This implies that if every monkey saw Lewis, no monkey is asleep.\n\n- **Condition 4**: A human saw Lewis.\n  - Since Lewis is not a donkey, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n  - If Lewis were a monkey, then every monkey would have seen Lewis, which would imply no monkey is asleep (from Condition 3). However, this contradicts the fact that Alfred isn't asleep and is not a monkey. Therefore, Lewis must be a human.\n\n- **Condition 6**: Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n  - Since Lewis is a human and Hazel is a human, this condition is consistent because humans can choose not to see other humans.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n1. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - False. Alfred isn't asleep (given).\n\n2. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - False. A human did see Lewis, but Alfred is not asleep.\n\n3. **If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred.**\n   - Since Alfred doesn't see Alfred (given), the condition \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred\" is always true (vacuously true).\n   - However, we need to check if \"not all humans are asleep\" is true. Since Alfred is a human and isn't asleep, not all humans are asleep.\n   - Therefore, the entire statement is true.\n\n4. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep.**\n   - We need to determine if Alfred sees Lewis. Since Alfred is a human and Lewis is a human, it is possible for Alfred to see Lewis.\n   - However, since Alfred isn't asleep, the statement \"a human is asleep\" is false.\n   - Therefore, the statement \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep\" is true if Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n\n5. **A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - True. A human saw Lewis (given), and Alfred isn't asleep (given).\n\n6. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless a human is asleep.**\n   - Since Alfred isn't asleep and is a human, and Lewis is a human, it is possible for Alfred to see Lewis.\n   - However, since no human is asleep (Alfred isn't asleep), the statement \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless a human is asleep\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **Statement 3**: If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n- **Statement 5**: A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.",

Therefore, every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\n\n2. **There is not a monkey that every monkey saw.**\n   - This is false because every monkey saw every monkey, so there is indeed a monkey that every monkey saw (in fact, every monkey fits this description).\n\n3. **No monkeys saw every monkey.**\n   - This is false because every monkey saw every monkey, so every monkey saw every monkey.\n\n4. **No monkeys saw a monkey.**\n   - This is false because every monkey saw every monkey, so every monkey saw at least one monkey.\n\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine whether Alfred will run or not. The statement \"Not all monkeys will run\" only tells us that at least one monkey will not run, but it doesn't specify which ones.\n\n6. **A monkey saw every monkey.**\n   - This is true because every monkey saw every monkey, so there is at least one monkey (in fact, every monkey) that saw every monkey.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. A monkey saw every monkey.**",

Therefore, if Alfred is a human, he cannot be hungry.\n- Similarly, if Lewis is a human, he cannot be hungry.\n- Since we don't have enough information to determine whether Alfred and Lewis are donkeys or monkeys, we cannot conclude that they are both hungry.\n- **Conclusion: This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred is hungry.\n- As mentioned, no humans are hungry. If Alfred is a human, he cannot be hungry.\n- We don't have enough information to determine if Alfred is a donkey or a monkey.\n- **Conclusion: This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 3: A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\n- \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if.\"\n- We need to consider two cases:\n  - If a human saw Alfred, then Hazel is not hungry.\n  - If Hazel is not hungry, then a human saw Alfred.\n- Since no humans are hungry, Hazel cannot be a human and thus cannot be hungry.\n- However, we don't have enough information to determine if a human saw Alfred.\n- **Conclusion: This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no humans are hungry.\n- \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if.\"\n- We know that Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n- We also know that no humans are hungry.\n- Therefore, Alfred doesn't see Hazel if and only if no humans are hungry.\n- **Conclusion: This statement is true.**\n\n#### Statement 5: If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n- We know that no humans are hungry.\n- The statement simplifies to: Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n- Since Alfred cannot see himself (as it is logically impossible for someone to see themselves in the context of this problem), the antecedent (Alfred saw Alfred) is false.\n- A false antecedent makes the entire implication true regardless of the consequent.\n- **Conclusion: This statement is true.**\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel are hungry.\n- We know that no humans are hungry.

A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statements\n1. **A human saw a human that saw a monkey.**\n   - This implies there are at least two humans and one monkey.\n   - Let's denote the humans as \\( H_1 \\) and \\( H_2 \\), and the monkey as \\( M \\).\n   - \\( H_1 \\) saw \\( H_2 \\), and \\( H_2 \\) saw \\( M \\).\n\n2. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - Hazel is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n   - Alfred is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\n3. **Every human saw Alfred.**\n   - Since every human saw Alfred, Alfred must be visible to all humans.\n   - This means Alfred is either a human or a monkey (since a donkey would not be seen by all humans).\n\n4. **A human chased Lewis only if every donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - If a human chased Lewis, then every donkey must have seen Hazel.\n   - This implies that if a human chased Lewis, Hazel must be visible to all donkeys.\n\n5. **If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel did not chase herself only if every monkey saw Lewis.\n   - This is a complex conditional statement, but it suggests a relationship between monkeys chasing Hazel and monkeys seeing Lewis.\n\n6. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n   - A human saw Lewis, so Lewis is visible to at least one human.\n\n### Deductions:\n- From statement 4, since every human saw Alfred, Alfred cannot be a donkey (as donkeys are not seen by all humans). Therefore, Alfred is either a human or a monkey.\n- From statement 6, since a human saw Lewis and Lewis is not a donkey, Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Alfred saw every human.**\n   - We know every human saw Alfred, but we don't have information about whether Alfred saw every human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred saw a human.**\n   - Since Alfred is either a human or a monkey, and every human saw Alfred, it is possible that Alfred saw a human. However, we don't have direct evidence that Alfred saw a human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No humans saw Alfred.**\n   - This contradicts statement 4, which says every human saw Alfred. This statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - This contradicts our deduction from statement 4. Alfred cannot be a donkey. This statement is false.\n\n5. **A human saw Alfred.**\n   - Since every human saw Alfred, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Not all humans saw Alfred.**\n   - This contradicts statement 4, which says every human saw Alfred.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A donkey saw a monkey that saw a donkey.\n3. Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n4. Every monkey saw Alfred.\n5. If every monkey kicked Lewis, then Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the statement \"A donkey saw a monkey that saw a donkey.\"\n- This implies there is at least one donkey and one monkey.\n- Let's denote the donkey as \\( D_1 \\) and the monkey as \\( M_1 \\).\n- \\( D_1 \\) saw \\( M_1 \\), and \\( M_1 \\) saw another donkey, which we can denote as \\( D_2 \\).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statement \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\"\n- This tells us something about Hazel and Alfred, but it doesn't directly help us determine their species.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the statement \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\"\n- This means Alfred must be visible to all monkeys.\n- Since there is at least one monkey, Alfred must be either a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the statement \"If every monkey kicked Lewis, then Lewis chased Lewis.\"\n- This is a conditional statement. It doesn't provide direct information about the species of Lewis or Alfred, but it does suggest that if a certain condition is met (every monkey kicking Lewis), then Lewis must have a specific behavior (chasing himself).\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n\n1. **No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every monkey saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - If Alfred were a donkey, he would still be visible to all monkeys, which is consistent with the given information. However, we need to check other possibilities.\n\n3. **Alfred saw every monkey.**\n   - The given information only states that every monkey saw Alfred, not that Alfred saw every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A monkey saw Alfred.**\n   - Since every monkey saw Alfred, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred saw a monkey.**\n   - The given information does not specify whether Alfred saw any monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every monkey saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. A monkey saw Alfred.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Every donkey saw Hazel only if a donkey saw Lewis.\n5. If not all humans chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys saw Lewis.\nThis is directly given as a fact. Therefore, we can conclude:\n- **No donkeys saw Lewis**.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey saw Lewis.\nSince no donkeys saw Lewis, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey saw Lewis.\nSince no donkeys saw Lewis, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.\nWe already know that no donkeys saw Lewis. Now, we need to determine if Lewis is a donkey. Since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and no donkeys saw Lewis, Lewis cannot be a donkey (because if he were, he would have seen himself, which contradicts the given information). Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey. Thus, the statement \"No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey\" is true.\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis saw a donkey.\nWe don't have any information about what Lewis saw. The given information only tells us what donkeys saw, not what Lewis saw. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether Lewis saw a donkey or not.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis saw every donkey.\nSimilar to Statement 1, we don't have any information about what Lewis saw. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether Lewis saw every donkey or not.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n- **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**3.

There is not a human that every human chased.\n5. Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey will attack.\n6. A human will attack and Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the type of Lewis\n- **Lewis kicked Lewis**: This implies that Lewis is not a human because humans cannot kick themselves (as per the given information).\n- **Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey will attack**: Since Lewis kicked Lewis, he cannot be a human. If Lewis were a monkey, then a monkey would have to attack for Lewis to be a donkey. However, since Lewis did kick himself, he must be a donkey. Therefore, Lewis is a donkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statement about humans and Alfred\n- **Every human kicked Alfred**: This means that if there is a human, that human kicked Alfred.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the statement about chasing\n- **There is not a human that every human chased**: This means that no single human was chased by every other human.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the statement about attacking\n- **A human will attack and Hazel didn't chase Hazel**: This implies that there is at least one human who will attack, and Hazel is not a human because humans cannot chase themselves.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n\n1. **Not all humans kicked Alfred**:\n   - Since every human kicked Alfred, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred will attack**:\n   - The information does not provide any direct evidence that Alfred will attack. We only know that a human will attack, but we don't know if Alfred is a human or what Alfred will do.\n\n3. **Alfred kicked every human**:\n   - The information does not provide any evidence that Alfred kicked every human. We only know that every human kicked Alfred.\n\n4. **No humans kicked Alfred**:\n   - This is false because every human kicked Alfred.\n\n5. **A human kicked Alfred**:\n   - This is true because every human kicked Alfred, and there is at least one human.\n\n6. **Alfred kicked a human**:\n   - The information does not provide any evidence that Alfred kicked a human.

Therefore, it must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.\"\nThis statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. The problem states that every donkey kicked a donkey, but it does not specify that there is a single donkey that was kicked by every other donkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Every donkey kicked every donkey.\"\nThis statement is stronger than the given information. The problem states that every donkey kicked a donkey, but it does not specify that every donkey kicked every other donkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"No donkeys kicked every donkey.\"\nThis statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. The problem states that every donkey kicked a donkey, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that no donkey kicked every other donkey.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Hazel is a human.\n3. No donkeys saw Lewis and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n4. Every monkey chased Lewis only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n5. If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the statements about donkeys\n- **No donkeys saw Lewis and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n  - This means that no donkey has seen either Lewis or Hazel.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statements about monkeys\n- **Every monkey chased Lewis only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.**\n  - This is a self-referential statement. It implies that if all monkeys chased Lewis, then the condition \"not all monkeys chased Lewis\" would be false, making the entire statement false. Therefore, it must be that not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the statements about humans\n- **If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n  - Since Hazel is a human, the statement \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is always true (because it's impossible for Hazel to chase herself).\n  - Therefore, if a human chased Lewis, then every monkey must have chased Hazel.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **A donkey saw a human.**\n   - We know that no donkeys saw Hazel, who is a human. However, there could be other humans that donkeys saw. This statement is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw a human.**\n   - Since no donkeys saw Hazel and we have no information about other humans, this statement is possible. However, it is not necessarily true because there could be other humans that donkeys saw.\n\n3. **A donkey saw every human.**\n   - This is impossible because no donkeys saw Hazel, who is a human. Therefore, no donkey can see every human.\n\n4. **Every donkey saw a human.**\n   - This is also impossible because no donkeys saw Hazel, who is a human. Therefore, not every donkey can see a human.\n\n5. **Every donkey saw every human.**\n   - This is impossible for the same reason as statement 3. No donkeys saw Hazel, so no donkey can see every human.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw every human.**\n   - This is true because no donkeys saw Hazel, who is a human. Therefore, no donkey can see every human.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. No donkeys saw every human.**",

Alfred chased a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement would mean that for every donkey \\( D \\) and every monkey \\( M \\), \\( D \\) chased \\( M \\).\n- The given information does not provide any evidence that donkeys chase monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement would mean that there exists at least one donkey \\( D \\) and one monkey \\( M \\) such that \\( D \\) chased \\( M \\).\n- Similar to Statement 1, the given information does not provide any evidence that donkeys chase monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement is stronger than Statement 1 and would mean that for every donkey \\( D \\) and every monkey \\( M \\), \\( D \\) chased \\( M \\).\n- Again, the given information does not support this claim. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n- This statement would mean that there exists at least one donkey \\( D \\) such that every monkey \\( M \\) chased \\( D \\).\n- The given information states that every monkey chased every donkey. Therefore, this statement is true because it is a direct consequence of the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- This statement would mean that for every donkey \\( D \\), there exists at least one monkey \\( M \\) that \\( D \\) did not chase.\n- Since the given information does not provide any evidence that donkeys chase monkeys, this statement is consistent with the given information. However, it is not necessarily true because we cannot rule out the possibility that some donkeys might chase some monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement would mean that for every donkey \\( D \\), there exists at least one monkey \\( M \\) such that \\( D \\) chased \\( M \\).\n- The given information does not provide any evidence that donkeys chase monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n\nThis is because the given information explicitly states that every monkey chased every donkey, which directly implies that there is at least one donkey that every monkey chased.",

If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then Hazel is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the chasing and seeing conditions\n- **No donkeys saw a human**: This means that if an entity is a donkey, it did not see any human.\n- **A donkey chased itself**: This implies there is at least one donkey who chased itself.\n- **Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This means Alfred is not a donkey (since a donkey chased itself).\n- **Lewis doesn't see Hazel**: This means Lewis and Hazel cannot both be humans (since humans can see each other).\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the conditional statements\n- **A monkey saw Alfred only if no humans are asleep**: This implies that if a monkey saw Alfred, then no humans are asleep.\n- **If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then Hazel is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred**: This implies that if Hazel is not a donkey (since a donkey chased itself), then Hazel being hungry depends on whether Alfred saw Alfred.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Alfred is not a donkey** because Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n2. **Hazel is not a donkey** because if Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then the condition about hunger and Alfred seeing Alfred applies.\n3. **Lewis and Hazel cannot both be humans** because Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\nGiven these deductions, let's consider the possible types for Alfred, Lewis, and Hazel:\n- Alfred could be a human or a monkey.\n- Hazel could be a human or a monkey.\n- Lewis could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\nHowever, since Lewis and Hazel cannot both be humans, and we need at least one of each type, let's explore the possibilities:\n\n#### Case 1: Alfred is a human\n- If Alfred is a human, then a monkey saw Alfred only if no humans are asleep. This means if a monkey saw Alfred, no humans are asleep.\n- Hazel cannot be a human (since Lewis and Hazel cannot both be humans), so Hazel must be a monkey.\n- Lewis must be a donkey (since there must be at least one donkey and Lewis cannot be a human).\n\n#### Case 2: Alfred is a monkey\n- If Alfred is a monkey, then a monkey saw Alfred, which means no humans are asleep.\n- Hazel cannot be a human (since Lewis and Hazel cannot both be humans), so Hazel must be a monkey.\n- Lewis must be a donkey (since there must be at least one donkey and Lewis cannot be a human).\n\nIn both cases, Lewis is a donkey, and Hazel is a monkey. Alfred can be either a human or a monkey, but the key point is that Lewis is a donkey and Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **A human will attack and no humans will attack**: This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n2. **A donkey saw every human**: This is false because no donkeys saw any humans.\n3. **There is not a human that every donkey saw**: This is true because no donkeys saw any humans.\n4. **A donkey saw a human**: This is false because no donkeys saw any humans.\n5. **Every donkey saw a human**: This is false because no donkeys saw any humans.\n6. **Every donkey saw every human**: This is false because no donkeys saw any humans.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n3. **There is not a human that every donkey saw**.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Every human is asleep.\n4. A human saw every donkey that saw it.\n5. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: Every human is asleep.\nThis is directly given in the problem. Therefore, we know for sure that every human is asleep.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human is asleep.\nSince every human is asleep (from Statement 3), it follows that at least one human is asleep. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 1: No humans are asleep.\nThis contradicts Statement 3, which states that every human is asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Only humans are asleep.\nWe know that every human is asleep, but we also know there are donkeys and monkeys. The problem does not provide information about whether donkeys or monkeys are asleep or awake. Therefore, we cannot conclude that only humans are asleep. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all humans are asleep.\nThis contradicts Statement 3, which states that every human is asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel is asleep.\nThe problem does not provide direct information about whether Hazel is a human, a donkey, or a monkey, nor does it specify whether Hazel is asleep or awake. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of this statement based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all humans are asleep if and only if a human is asleep.\nThis statement is a tautology because it is always true. If a human is asleep, then it is true that not all humans are asleep (since there is at least one human who is asleep). Conversely, if not all humans are asleep, then at least one human is asleep. However, since we know from Statement 3 that every human is asleep, this statement is not relevant to our specific situation.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 5: A human is asleep.**\n\nAll other statements are either false or not necessarily true based on the given information.",

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: There is a donkey that every human chased.\n- This statement is also too strong. The second piece of information only states that every donkey chased a human that chased it, which does not imply that every human chased the same donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey chased a human.\n- This statement is consistent with the second piece of information: \"Every donkey chased a human that chased it.\" Since there is at least one donkey and one human, and every donkey chased a human that chased it, there must be at least one donkey that chased a human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys chased every human.\n- This statement is consistent with the second piece of information. The second piece of information only states that every donkey chased a human that chased it, not every human. Therefore, it is possible that no donkey chased every human. However, this statement is not necessarily true because it is not required by the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey chased every human.\n- This statement is too strong. The second piece of information only states that every donkey chased a human that chased it, not every human.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. No donkeys are asleep.\n4. If every human is asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n5. Lewis is a donkey.\n6. Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Lewis is a donkey** (Given).\n2. **No donkeys are asleep** (Given). Therefore, **Lewis is not asleep**.\n3. **Hazel is a monkey** (Given).\n\nNow, let's consider the conditional statement: \"If every human is asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n\n- **Lewis didn't chase Lewis** is always true because it is a tautology (a statement that is always true regardless of the conditions).\n- Therefore, the statement simplifies to: \"If every human is asleep, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n\nSince Lewis is a donkey and he is not asleep, we need to determine the status of Alfred and the other humans.\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n1. **Every human is asleep**:\n   - In this case, the statement \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" must be true.\n   - Since Lewis is a donkey and he is not asleep, he cannot have kicked Alfred (because no donkeys are asleep, and thus they cannot perform actions like kicking).\n   - Therefore, Alfred must not be kicked by any donkey, which means Alfred is not affected by the donkeys' actions.\n\n2. **Not every human is asleep**:\n   - In this case, the statement \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" does not need to be true, so it can be either true or false.\n   - However, since Lewis is a donkey and he is not asleep, he still cannot kick Alfred.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Lewis is not asleep** (from point 2).\n- **Alfred's sleep status is not directly determined by the given information**. However, since no donkeys are asleep and Lewis is a donkey, Alfred's sleep status is independent of the donkeys' actions.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **Alfred isn't asleep**: This is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n2. **Lewis is asleep**: This is false because Lewis is a donkey and no donkeys are asleep.\n3. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep**: This is false because Lewis is not asleep.\n4. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep**: This is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n5. **Lewis isn't asleep**: This is true.\n6. **Alfred is asleep**: This is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5.

It only states that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, which does not necessarily mean that there is a single monkey that all others chased.\n- **Statement 1 is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey chased every monkey.\n- The information given does not specify that there is a single monkey that chased every other monkey. It only states that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, which does not necessarily mean that there is a single monkey that chased all others.\n- **Statement 3 is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 5: Every monkey chased every monkey.\n- The information given does not specify that every monkey chased every other monkey. It only states that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, which does not necessarily mean that every monkey chased every other monkey.\n- **Statement 5 is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 6: No monkeys chased every monkey.\n- This statement is consistent with the information given. Since every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, it does not imply that any monkey chased every other monkey.\n- **Statement 6 is true.**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 2: A monkey chased a monkey.**\n- **Statement 6: No monkeys chased every monkey.**",

Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n6. Every human saw Alfred.\n7. If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys kicked Alfred.\nThis means that if \\( D \\) represents a donkey, then \\( D \\) did not kick Alfred. This directly implies that Alfred was not kicked by any donkey.\n\n#### Statement 4: A monkey saw every donkey that saw it.\nThis means that if a donkey \\( D \\) saw a monkey \\( M \\), then \\( M \\) saw \\( D \\). This is a mutual observation condition.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\nThis means that there exists at least one donkey \\( D \\) such that \\( D \\) did not see Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every human saw Alfred.\nThis means that if \\( H \\) represents a human, then \\( H \\) saw Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 7: If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\nThis is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n- If Alfred doesn't see Lewis (\\( A \\nrightarrow L \\)), then:\n  - Not all donkeys kicked Alfred (\\( \\neg \\forall D (D \\rightarrow K_A) \\)) only if no monkeys kicked Hazel (\\( \\neg \\exists M (M \\rightarrow K_H) \\)).\n\nSince we already know from Statement 3 that no donkeys kicked Alfred, the condition \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is always true. Therefore, the statement simplifies to:\n- If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Alfred kicked every donkey.**\n   - We have no information about Alfred kicking donkeys. This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - From Statement 3, we know that no donkeys kicked Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **A donkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - From Statement 3, we know that no donkeys kicked Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.**\n   - From Statement 3, we know that no donkeys kicked Alfred, which implies that not all donkeys kicked Alfred.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Alfred and Hazel are happy.\n3. Hazel doesn't see Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n4. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of Alfred, Hazel, and Lewis\n- **Alfred and Hazel are happy.**\n  - This means Alfred and Hazel are either humans or monkeys (since donkeys cannot be happy).\n\n- **Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n  - This implies Hazel is not a monkey because monkeys can see themselves. Therefore, Hazel must be a human.\n\n- **A monkey kicked Alfred.**\n  - Since Hazel is a human, Alfred must be a monkey (because a monkey kicked him, and donkeys cannot be kicked by monkeys).\n\n- **If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.**\n  - This statement is a conditional. We need to consider two cases:\n    - **Case 1: Lewis is a donkey.**\n      - If Lewis is a donkey, then the condition \"every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel\" must hold.\n      - Since Alfred is a monkey and he was kicked, he must have seen Hazel (because he is a monkey and the condition must hold).\n    - **Case 2: Lewis is not a donkey.**\n      - If Lewis is not a donkey, the condition does not apply, and we don't need to consider it further.\n\n#### Step 2: Evaluate the Statements\n1. **Lewis is happy.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Lewis is happy. He could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and his happiness is not specified.\n\n2. **Alfred is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - Alfred is happy (given).\n   - Hazel doesn't see Hazel (given).\n   - This statement is true.\n\n3. **Alfred is happy but it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - Alfred is happy (given).\n   - Hazel doesn't see Hazel (given).\n   - This statement is false because Hazel does not see Hazel.\n\n4. **Lewis and Alfred are happy.**\n   - Alfred is happy (given).\n   - We don't know if Lewis is happy.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't happy.**\n   - Alfred is happy (given).\n   - This statement is false.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n   - Alfred is happy (given).\n   - We don't know if Lewis is happy.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**2. Alfred is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**",

If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n4. Only humans are hungry but it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities and their states.\n- There are at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Hazel or Lewis are hungry.\n- Only humans are hungry.\n- Hazel is asleep.\n\nFrom the fourth piece of information, we know:\n- Hazel is asleep.\n- Since only humans are hungry and Hazel is asleep, Hazel cannot be hungry.\n- Therefore, Lewis must be the hungry human.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the conditional statement.\n- If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n\nSince Hazel is asleep, she cannot have kicked Alfred. This means the condition \"Hazel kicked Alfred\" is false. For the implication to hold true, the antecedent \"not all humans are asleep\" must also be false. Therefore, all humans must be asleep.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the statements.\n1. **Not all humans are hungry.**\n   - Since only humans are hungry and Lewis is the only hungry human, this statement is true.\n\n2. **Every human is hungry.**\n   - This is false because only Lewis is hungry, not all humans.\n\n3. **A human is hungry.**\n   - This is true because Lewis is hungry.\n\n4. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine Alfred's state (asleep or awake). However, since all humans are asleep, if Alfred is a human, he must be asleep. But we don't know if Alfred is a human.\n\n5. **No humans are hungry.**\n   - This is false because Lewis is hungry.\n\n6. **Only humans are hungry and not all humans are hungry.**\n   - This is true because only humans are hungry, and only Lewis (one human) is hungry, so not all humans are hungry.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **3. A human is hungry.**\n- **6. Only humans are hungry and not all humans are hungry.**",

A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the implications of \"No humans saw Alfred.\"\n- This means that if a human saw Alfred, it would be a contradiction. Therefore, no human can see Alfred.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statement \"A human is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n- This can be interpreted as: If a human is happy, then not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n- Conversely, if all donkeys chased Alfred, then no human is happy.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the statement \"A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\"\n- This can be interpreted as: If a human saw Alfred, then Hazel isn't hungry.\n- Since no human saw Alfred (from Step 1), Hazel must be hungry.\n\n### Conclusion from Steps 1-3:\n- Hazel is hungry (because no human saw Alfred).\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the happiness of Alfred.\n- We know that no human saw Alfred, so the condition \"a human saw Alfred\" is false.\n- The statement \"A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry\" is true because both sides of the implication are false (no human saw Alfred, and Hazel is hungry).\n- The statement \"A human is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred\" tells us that if a human is happy, then not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n- Since no human saw Alfred, we cannot directly determine the happiness of Alfred based on this information alone.\n\n### Final Analysis:\n- **Hazel is hungry** (Statement 1) must be true.\n- **Alfred isn't happy** (Statement 2) is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information to determine Alfred's happiness.\n- **Alfred and Hazel are happy** (Statement 3) is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information to determine Alfred's happiness.\n- **Alfred is happy** (Statement 4) is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information to determine Alfred's happiness.\n- **Hazel isn't hungry** (Statement 5) is false because we have determined that Hazel is hungry.\n- **Hazel is happy** (Statement 6) is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information to determine Hazel's happiness.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n1.

It only means that for each monkey, there is some human who saw it.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every human saw a monkey.**\n   - This would mean that each human has seen at least one monkey.\n   - Given that every monkey saw a human that saw it, it implies that there is a mutual visibility between at least one human and each monkey.\n   - Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Every human saw every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that each human has seen all the monkeys.\n   - The given information only states that every monkey saw a human that saw it, which does not imply that every human saw every monkey.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No humans saw a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every monkey saw a human that saw it.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A human saw a monkey.**\n   - This is a weaker form of statement 2, which we have already determined to be true.\n   - Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No humans saw every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that no single human saw all the monkeys.\n   - The given information does not provide enough evidence to conclude this definitively. However, since we cannot confirm that every human saw every monkey, this statement could be true.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily false, but it is not necessarily true either.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **2.

Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel ate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine Lewis's Identity\n- **Lewis chased every monkey.**\n- **No humans chased every monkey.**\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that Lewis cannot be a human because no human chased every monkey. Therefore, Lewis must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Hazel's Identity and Eating Status\n- **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel ate.**\n\nThis statement can be rephrased as:\n- If Hazel is not a human, then Hazel ate.\n\nWe need to consider the possible scenarios for Hazel:\n- If Hazel is a human, the statement does not provide any information about whether Hazel ate or not.\n- If Hazel is not a human (i.e., Hazel is either a donkey or a monkey), then Hazel must have eaten.\n\nSince there is at least one of each type (donkey, human, monkey), Hazel could be any of these. However, if Hazel is not a human, Hazel must have eaten.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the Statements\n1. **Lewis is a human.**\n   - False, because Lewis cannot be a human (as established in Step 1).\n\n2. **Lewis didn't eat.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Lewis ate or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis ate.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Lewis ate or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Lewis isn't a human.**\n   - True, as established in Step 1.\n\n5. **Hazel ate.**\n   - If Hazel is not a human, Hazel must have eaten. Since there is at least one of each type, Hazel could be a donkey or a monkey, which means Hazel must have eaten. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Lewis and Hazel ate.**\n   - We know Hazel ate if Hazel is not a human, but we do not have enough information to determine whether Lewis ate. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n4. Lewis isn't a human.\n5. Hazel ate.",

If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### 1. **A monkey saw a human that saw a monkey.**\n   - Let's denote the monkey as \\( M_1 \\), the human as \\( H_1 \\), and the monkey seen by \\( H_1 \\) as \\( M_2 \\).\n   - This means \\( M_1 \\) saw \\( H_1 \\), and \\( H_1 \\) saw \\( M_2 \\).\n\n#### 2. **Lewis saw every human.**\n   - Lewis is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n   - Since Lewis saw every human, Lewis cannot be a human (because a human cannot see every human, including themselves).\n   - Therefore, Lewis is either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n#### 3. **No donkeys chased Alfred just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This can be interpreted as: If every monkey chased Hazel, then no donkeys chased Alfred.\n   - Let's denote this as: \\( \\forall M (M \\text{ chased } H) \\rightarrow \\neg \\exists D (D \\text{ chased } A) \\).\n\n#### 4. **If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This can be interpreted as: If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - Let's denote this as: \\( \\neg \\forall D (D \\text{ kicked } A) \\rightarrow (H \\text{ kicked } A \\rightarrow \\neg \\forall D (D \\text{ kicked } H)) \\).\n\n#### 5. **If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This can be interpreted as: If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - Let's denote this as: \\( \\neg (A \\text{ kicked } H) \\rightarrow (\\forall M (M \\text{ kicked } L) \\rightarrow \\neg \\exists M (M \\text{ kicked } H)) \\).\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n\n1. **No humans saw Lewis.**\n   - If Lewis is a donkey, this could be true because donkeys might not be seen by humans.\n   - If Lewis is a monkey, this could be false because monkeys might be seen by humans.\n   - We need more information to determine this definitively.\n\n2. **Lewis saw a human.**\n   - Since Lewis saw every human, this statement is true regardless of whether Lewis is a donkey or a monkey.\n\n3. **A human saw Lewis.**\n   - If Lewis is a donkey, this could be false because donkeys might not be seen by humans.\n   - If Lewis is a monkey, this could be true because monkeys might be seen by humans.\n   - We need more information to determine this definitively.\n\n4. **Not all humans saw Lewis.**\n   - If Lewis is a donkey, this could be true because donkeys might not be seen by humans.\n   - If Lewis is a monkey, this could be false because monkeys might be seen by humans.\n   - We need more information to determine this definitively.\n\n5. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - The given information does not provide enough details to determine Alfred's species definitively.\n\n6. **Every human saw Lewis.**\n   - Since Lewis saw every human, it is possible that every human saw Lewis, but we need more information to confirm this.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the given information and the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**2. Lewis saw a human.**\n\nThis is because the statement \"Lewis saw every human\" directly implies that Lewis saw at least one human, making this statement true.",

A monkey kicked Hazel unless not all donkeys will run.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Lewis is not a donkey, so he must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the actions involving donkeys\n- Not all donkeys ate.\n- No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nFrom these two points, we can infer:\n- There is at least one donkey that did not eat.\n- No donkey kicked Hazel.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the condition involving monkeys\n- A monkey kicked Hazel unless not all donkeys will run.\n\nThis statement can be broken down into two cases:\n1. If all donkeys will run, then a monkey kicked Hazel.\n2. If not all donkeys will run, then it is not necessarily true that a monkey kicked Hazel.\n\nSince we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel, the only way for a monkey to have kicked Hazel is if all donkeys will run. Therefore, we need to determine if all donkeys will run.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if all donkeys will run\n- We know that not all donkeys ate, but this does not directly tell us about their running behavior.\n- The statement \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless not all donkeys will run\" implies that if not all donkeys will run, then it is not necessarily true that a monkey kicked Hazel.\n\nGiven that no donkeys kicked Hazel, the only consistent scenario is that all donkeys will run, which means a monkey must have kicked Hazel.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n1. **Hazel kicked a donkey.**\n   - There is no information provided about Hazel kicking any donkey. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Lewis will run.**\n   - Since Lewis is not a donkey, he must be either a human or a monkey. The information does not specify whether humans or monkeys will run. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n3. **A donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - We know that no donkeys kicked Hazel. This statement is false.\n\n4. **Every donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Hazel kicked every donkey.**\n   - There is no information provided about Hazel kicking any donkey. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5. Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n4. Lewis kicked a donkey.\n5. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n6. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the types of Alfred, Lewis, and Hazel\n- **Alfred doesn't see Lewis**: This implies that Alfred and Lewis are different types (since they can't see their own kind).\n- **Lewis kicked a donkey**: This means Lewis is either a human or a monkey (donkeys can't kick other donkeys).\n- **No donkeys kicked Hazel**: This means Hazel is either a human or a monkey (donkeys can't kick other donkeys).\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the possible types for each individual\n- **Lewis**: Since Lewis kicked a donkey, he cannot be a donkey. Therefore, Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n- **Hazel**: Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, she cannot be a donkey. Therefore, Hazel is either a human or a monkey.\n- **Alfred**: Since Alfred doesn't see Lewis, Alfred must be a different type from Lewis. If Lewis is a human, Alfred must be a monkey. If Lewis is a monkey, Alfred must be a human.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the statements\n1. **Alfred is a donkey**: This is false because Alfred must be either a human or a monkey.\n2. **Hazel kicked a donkey**: We don't have enough information to determine if Hazel kicked a donkey. She could be a human or a monkey, and we don't know if she kicked a donkey.\n3. **Hazel kicked every donkey**: This is false because we don't have enough information to conclude that Hazel kicked every donkey. She could be a human or a monkey, and we don't know her actions towards all donkeys.\n4. **Every donkey kicked Hazel**: This is false because we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n5. **A donkey kicked Hazel**: This is false because we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n6. **Not all donkeys kicked Hazel**: This is true because we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel, which implies that not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that only monkeys are asleep. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Alfred is asleep.\"\n- We do not have direct information about Alfred's sleep status. The only information related to Alfred is that every donkey chased Alfred unless a human kicked Lewis. This does not provide enough information to determine Alfred's sleep status. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\"\n- Similar to the previous point, we do not have direct information about the sleep status of Alfred or Lewis. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Not all monkeys are asleep.\"\n- We know that every monkey is asleep, so this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"A monkey is asleep.\"\n- Since every monkey is asleep, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"No monkeys are asleep.\"\n- This directly contradicts the given information that every monkey is asleep.

No donkeys will attack just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each:**\n   - This means we have at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **Hazel or Lewis are happy:**\n   - At least one of Hazel or Lewis is happy.\n\n3. **Hazel is hungry:**\n   - Hazel is currently hungry.\n\n4. **No donkeys will attack just in case Hazel isn't hungry:**\n   - This can be interpreted as: If Hazel is not hungry, then no donkeys will attack.\n   - Since Hazel is hungry, the condition \"if Hazel is not hungry\" is false.\n   - In logic, a statement of the form \"if P then Q\" is always true when P is false, regardless of the truth value of Q.\n   - Therefore, the statement \"No donkeys will attack just in case Hazel isn't hungry\" does not provide any information about whether donkeys will attack or not when Hazel is hungry.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **Only donkeys will attack:**\n   - This statement implies that if any entity attacks, it must be a donkey.\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if only donkeys will attack.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys will attack:**\n   - This statement implies that at least one donkey will not attack.\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if some donkeys will not attack.\n\n3. **No donkeys will attack:**\n   - This statement implies that no donkeys will attack.\n   - Since Hazel is hungry, the condition \"if Hazel is not hungry\" is false, and the statement \"No donkeys will attack just in case Hazel isn't hungry\" does not provide any information about whether donkeys will attack or not when Hazel is hungry.\n   - Therefore, we cannot conclude that no donkeys will attack.\n\n4. **Lewis will attack:**\n   - There is no information provided about Lewis's behavior or intentions to attack.\n   - We cannot conclude that Lewis will attack.\n\n5. **A donkey will attack:**\n   - This statement implies that at least one donkey will attack.\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if any donkeys will attack.\n\n6. **Every donkey will attack:**\n   - This statement implies that all donkeys will attack.\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if all donkeys will attack.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the information provided, none of the statements can be definitively concluded to be true based on the given conditions.

It is not the case that Lewis didn't chase Hazel.\n6. Hazel isn't a human just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Interpret the Statements\n- **Lewis is a donkey**: \\( L \\) is a donkey.\n- **Every human is happy**: All humans are happy.\n- **It is not the case that Lewis didn't chase Hazel**: This means Lewis did chase Hazel. So, \\( L \\) chased \\( H \\).\n- **Hazel isn't a human just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred**: This is a conditional statement. It can be interpreted as:\n  - If Hazel is not a human, then not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n  - If all donkeys chased Alfred, then Hazel is a human.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Hazel's Type\n- Since Lewis is a donkey and he chased Hazel, we know \\( L \\) chased \\( H \\).\n- We need to determine if Hazel is a human or not.\n- If Hazel is a human, then all donkeys chased Alfred.\n- If Hazel is not a human, then not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Conditional Statement\n- Let's assume Hazel is a human. Then, all donkeys chased Alfred.\n- If Hazel is not a human, then not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nSince we know Lewis is a donkey and he chased Hazel, we need to check if this affects the other donkeys' behavior towards Alfred.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate Each Statement\n1. **A donkey chased Hazel**: True, because Lewis is a donkey and he chased Hazel.\n2. **Hazel chased every donkey**: We have no information about Hazel chasing donkeys, so this cannot be determined.\n3. **Not all donkeys chased Hazel**: We know Lewis chased Hazel, but we don't know about other donkeys. This cannot be determined.\n4. **Every donkey chased Hazel**: We only know Lewis chased Hazel, but we don't know about other donkeys. This cannot be determined.\n5. **Hazel chased a donkey**: We have no information about Hazel chasing donkeys, so this cannot be determined.\n6. **No donkeys chased Hazel**: False, because Lewis chased Hazel.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n1.

This means that if this statement is true, then Statement 4 must also be true.\n\n2. **Lewis chased a human.**\n   - There is no direct information about Lewis chasing a human. We cannot determine this from the given information.\n\n3. **Lewis chased every human.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, there is no direct information about Lewis chasing every human. We cannot determine this from the given information.\n\n4. **Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n   - From Statement 3, if a human chased Lewis, then not all humans chased Lewis. This means that if any human chased Lewis, this statement must be true. However, if no human chased Lewis, this statement is still true because \"not all\" includes the possibility of none.\n\n5. **Every human chased Lewis.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 3. If every human chased Lewis, then it would not be true that a human chased Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **No humans chased Lewis.**\n   - This is a specific case of \"not all humans chased Lewis.\" If no humans chased Lewis, then it is true that not all humans chased Lewis. However, we cannot definitively conclude this from the given information alone.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n\nThis is because if any human chased Lewis, then not all humans chased Lewis (from Statement 3). Even if no humans chased Lewis, it still holds that not all humans chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement is always true.",

If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if Lewis is hungry.\n5. A monkey is hungry.\n6. It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the implications of \"Every monkey saw Hazel.\"\n- This means that Hazel must be visible to all monkeys. Therefore, Hazel cannot be a donkey because donkeys do not see anything (as per the exclusivity rule).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statement \"It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n- This implies that Hazel cannot be a human because humans can see themselves. Therefore, Hazel must be a monkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the statement \"A monkey is hungry.\"\n- We know there is at least one hungry monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the conditional statement \"If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if Lewis is hungry.\"\n- Let's denote:\n  - \\( H \\) as \"a human chased Lewis\"\n  - \\( M_L \\) as \"every monkey saw Lewis\"\n  - \\( L_H \\) as \"Lewis is hungry\"\n\n  The statement can be written as:\n  \\[\n  H \\rightarrow (M_L \\rightarrow L_H)\n  \\]\n\n  This can be broken down into:\n  - If \\( H \\) is true, then \\( M_L \\rightarrow L_H \\) must be true.\n  - If \\( H \\) is false, the statement is vacuously true regardless of \\( M_L \\) and \\( L_H \\).\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the implications for Lewis.\n- Since we know Hazel is a monkey and every monkey saw Hazel, Hazel being a monkey does not provide direct information about Lewis's hunger status.\n- However, if a human chased Lewis, then the condition \\( M_L \\rightarrow L_H \\) must hold. This means if every monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis must be hungry.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n1. **Hazel is hungry.**\n   - We know Hazel is a monkey, and there is at least one hungry monkey. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that Hazel specifically is the hungry monkey.\n   - **Not necessarily true.**\n\n2. **Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine Lewis's hunger status directly from the given conditions.\n   - **Not necessarily true.**\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a monkey.**\n   - We have already determined that Hazel is a monkey.\n   - **False.**\n\n4. **Hazel is a monkey.**\n   - We have already determined that Hazel is a monkey.\n   - **True.**\n\n5. **Lewis and Hazel are hungry.**\n   - We know Hazel is a monkey and there is at least one hungry monkey, but we do not have enough information to conclude that Hazel is the hungry monkey or that Lewis is hungry.\n   - **Not necessarily true.**\n\n6. **Lewis is hungry.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine Lewis's hunger status directly from the given conditions.\n   - **Not necessarily true.**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n**4.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. No humans are asleep.\n4. Not all monkeys are asleep.\n5. No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans are asleep.\nThis is directly given as a fact. Therefore, it is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all monkeys are asleep.\nThis is also directly given as a fact. Therefore, it is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis.\nThis can be interpreted as:\n- If no humans are asleep, then not all humans chased Lewis.\nSince we know from Statement 3 that no humans are asleep, this implies that not all humans chased Lewis. This statement is true.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Only humans are asleep.**\n   - Since no humans are asleep (Statement 3), this statement is false.\n\n2. **Lewis is asleep.**\n   - There is no information provided about Lewis's state (asleep or awake). Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true or false based on the given information.\n\n3. **Every human is asleep.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 3, which states that no humans are asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This is consistent with Statement 3, which states that no humans are asleep. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Not all humans are asleep if and only if a human is asleep.**\n   - This is a contradiction because if no humans are asleep (Statement 3), then \"not all humans are asleep\" is true, but \"a human is asleep\" is false. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **A human is asleep.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 3, which states that no humans are asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- Statement 3: No humans are asleep.\n- Statement 4: Not all monkeys are asleep.\n- Statement 5: No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**Statements 3, 4, and 5 must be true.**",

Every human saw every monkey that saw every donkey.\n7. No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: No monkeys saw a monkey.\nThis is a crucial piece of information. It directly implies that no monkey can see another monkey. This will help us eliminate some of the options.\n\n#### Statement 4: A monkey ate.\nThis tells us that at least one monkey exists and that this monkey performed an action (eating).\n\n#### Statement 5: Every human chased every human that chased it.\nThis is a reflexive and symmetric property among humans. If a human \\( H_1 \\) chases a human \\( H_2 \\), then \\( H_2 \\) also chases \\( H_1 \\).\n\n#### Statement 6: Every human saw every monkey that saw every donkey.\nThis means that for any human \\( H \\), if a monkey \\( M \\) saw a donkey \\( D \\), then \\( H \\) saw \\( M \\).\n\n#### Statement 7: No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a human saw Hazel.\nThis is a conditional statement. It means that the condition \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is true if and only if a human saw Hazel. This implies a relationship between the actions of donkeys and the observations of humans.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **There is a monkey that every monkey saw.**\n   - False. According to statement 3, no monkeys saw a monkey. Therefore, no monkey can be seen by every monkey.\n\n2. **A monkey saw every monkey.**\n   - False. Again, according to statement 3, no monkeys saw a monkey. Therefore, no monkey can see every monkey.\n\n3. **A monkey saw a monkey.**\n   - False. Directly contradicts statement 3.\n\n4. **Every monkey saw every monkey.**\n   - False. Directly contradicts statement 3.\n\n5. **A monkey saw every monkey that saw it.**\n   - False. According to statement 3, no monkeys saw a monkey. Therefore, no monkey can see any other monkey, including those that saw it.\n\n6. **Every monkey saw a monkey.**\n   - False. Directly contradicts statement 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the given statements must be true in this situation. The correct answer is:\n\n**None of the statements must be true.**",

A human will attack and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis.\"\nThis can be interpreted as:\n- If no humans are asleep, then not all humans chased Lewis.\n- Equivalently, if all humans chased Lewis, then some humans are asleep.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"A human will attack and only donkeys are asleep.\"\n- This means that if a human attacks, then only donkeys are asleep.\n- Since only donkeys are asleep, no humans are asleep.\n\nCombining these two statements:\n- If all humans chased Lewis, then some humans are asleep (from Statement 2).\n- But if some humans are asleep, then a human cannot attack (since only donkeys are asleep, and no humans are asleep).\n\nThis creates a contradiction because if all humans chased Lewis, then some humans are asleep, which means no humans can attack, but a human will attack if only donkeys are asleep. Therefore, it cannot be true that all humans chased Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion from the above analysis:\n- **Not all humans chased Lewis** must be true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the other statements based on this conclusion:\n\n1. **No humans chased Lewis.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. We only know that not all humans chased Lewis, but some might have.\n\n2. **Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n   - This is true based on our analysis.\n\n3. **Every human chased Lewis.**\n   - This is false because we have established that not all humans chased Lewis.\n\n4. **Lewis chased a human.**\n   - The problem does not provide any information about Lewis chasing anyone, so this cannot be determined.\n\n5. **A human chased Lewis.**\n   - The problem does not provide any information about a human chasing Lewis, so this cannot be determined.\n\n6. **Lewis chased every human.**\n   - The problem does not provide any information about Lewis chasing everyone, so this cannot be determined.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n2.

This means that for every entity that is a monkey, they kicked Lewis and are happy.\n- **Statement 5**: If every monkey kicked Lewis, then not all humans kicked Hazel. Since we know from Statement 4 that every monkey did kick Lewis, this implies that not all humans kicked Hazel.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine what must be true based on the implications.\n- From Statement 5, since every monkey kicked Lewis, it follows that not all humans kicked Hazel. Therefore, Statement 5 must be true.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate each of the given options.\n1. **No humans kicked Hazel**: This is not necessarily true. We only know that not all humans kicked Hazel, but some might have.\n2. **Every human kicked Hazel**: This is false because not all humans kicked Hazel.\n3. **A human kicked Hazel**: This could be true, but it is not necessarily true.

Every donkey sees \\( h \\).\n- **Hazel doesn't see Hazel**: Hazel cannot be a donkey (since donkeys see the human \\( h \\)), so Hazel must be a human or a monkey.\n- **It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel**: This means Lewis sees Hazel. Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey (since donkeys only see the human \\( h \\)).\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the types of Hazel and Lewis\n- Since Hazel doesn't see Hazel, Hazel cannot be a donkey. Hazel can be a human or a monkey.\n- Since Lewis sees Hazel, Lewis cannot be a donkey. Lewis can be a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate each statement\n\n1. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel**:\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, he sees the human \\( h \\) but not Lewis (since Lewis is not a donkey).\n   - If Alfred is a human, he might see Lewis.\n   - For the statement to be true, if Alfred sees Lewis, then not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n   - This is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information about the visibility of monkeys to Hazel.\n\n2. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no monkeys saw Lewis**:\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, he sees the human \\( h \\) but not Hazel (since Hazel is not a donkey).\n   - If Alfred is a human, he might see Hazel.\n   - For the statement to be true, Alfred seeing Hazel implies that some monkeys saw Lewis.\n   - This is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information about the visibility of monkeys to Lewis.\n\n3. **Every monkey saw Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel**:\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, no monkeys saw Alfred (contradiction).\n   - If Alfred is a human, every monkey might see Alfred.\n   - Lewis sees Hazel, so this part is false.\n   - This statement is false.\n\n4. **Every monkey saw Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel**:\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, no monkeys saw Alfred (contradiction).\n   - If Alfred is a human, every monkey might see Alfred.\n   - Lewis sees Hazel, so this part is true.\n   - This statement is true.\n\n5. **No monkeys saw Alfred just in case Lewis saw Hazel**:\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, no monkeys saw Alfred.\n   - Lewis sees Hazel, so this part is true.\n   - This statement is true.\n\n6. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis or not all monkeys saw Hazel**:\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, he doesn't see Lewis.\n   - If Alfred is a human, he might see Lewis.\n   - For the statement to be true, if Alfred sees Lewis, then not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n   - This is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information about the visibility of monkeys to Hazel.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **4.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No humans are hungry if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\n3. If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if every monkey is hungry.\n4. A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the fourth statement\n- \"A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n- This can be simplified to: \"A human saw Lewis and Lewis saw Hazel.\"\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- \\( \\text{Human} \\rightarrow \\text{Saw Lewis} \\)\n- \\( \\text{Lewis} \\rightarrow \\text{Saw Hazel} \\)\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the second statement\n- \"No humans are hungry if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\"\n- Since we know Lewis saw Hazel, the condition \"No humans are hungry\" must be true.\n\nThus, we have:\n- \\( \\text{No humans are hungry} \\)\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the third statement\n- \"If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if every monkey is hungry.\"\n- We need to consider two cases:\n  - Case 1: Alfred sees Lewis.\n  - Case 2: Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n\nSince we don't have direct information about whether Alfred sees Lewis, we need to consider both cases.\n\n**Case 1: Alfred sees Lewis**\n- The implication \"if Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is false, so the entire statement is vacuously true. This means we don't get any new information from this case.\n\n**Case 2: Alfred doesn't see Lewis**\n- The statement becomes: \"Every monkey saw Lewis only if every monkey is hungry.\"\n- This can be written as: \\( (\\forall \\text{monkey } m, m \\text{ saw Lewis}) \\rightarrow (\\forall \\text{monkey } m, m \\text{ is hungry}) \\).\n\nHowever, since we already know no humans are hungry, and the problem states there is at least one of each type (donkey, human, monkey), the presence of at least one non-hungry human implies that the statement about monkeys being hungry is not necessarily true. Therefore, this case does not provide additional constraints.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis, we have determined that:\n- No humans are hungry.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **No humans are hungry.** (True)\n2. **Only humans are hungry and not all humans are hungry.** (False, because no humans are hungry)\n3. **Alfred is hungry.** (We have no information about Alfred's hunger status)\n4. **Every human is hungry.** (False, because no humans are hungry)\n5. **Only humans are hungry.** (False, because no humans are hungry)\n6. **A human is hungry.** (False, because no humans are hungry)\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n1. No humans are hungry.",

This means Hazel is not blind to herself.\n- Since Hazel sees Hazel, Hazel cannot be a donkey because all donkeys will run, and if Hazel were a donkey, she would run, which contradicts the fact that no donkeys kicked Hazel (point 3).\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the Implications of Hazel Kicking Hazel\n- From point 5, \"If Hazel kicked Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n  - If Hazel kicked Hazel, then for every monkey to have seen Hazel, no monkeys must have kicked Hazel.\n  - However, since Hazel sees Hazel, and we know Hazel is not a donkey, Hazel could be either a human or a monkey.\n  - If Hazel is a monkey, and Hazel kicked Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel, which is consistent with the statement.\n  - If Hazel is a human, and Hazel kicked Hazel, then the statement about monkeys seeing Hazel and not kicking Hazel still holds.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine Running Behavior\n- From point 6, \"Not all humans will run.\"\n- From point 7, \"Every donkey will run.\"\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate Each Statement\n1. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and a human will run.**\n   - False, because Hazel sees Hazel (point 4).\n\n2. **Hazel will run.**\n   - If Hazel is a donkey, Hazel will run (point 7). However, Hazel cannot be a donkey (step 1).\n   - If Hazel is a human, Hazel might or might not run (point 6).\n   - If Hazel is a monkey, Hazel might or might not run (no information given about monkeys running).\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Hazel saw Hazel and a human will run.**\n   - True, because Hazel sees Hazel (point 4) and not all humans will run (point 6), so at least one human will run.\n\n4. **Hazel saw Hazel and no humans will run.**\n   - False, because not all humans will run (point 6) implies that at least one human will run.\n\n5. **Hazel saw Hazel and only humans will run.**\n   - False, because every donkey will run (point 7), so donkeys will also run.\n\n6. **Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run.**\n   - True, because Hazel sees Hazel (point 4) and not all humans will run (point 6).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **3. Hazel saw Hazel and a human will run.**\n- **6. Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run.**",

A human will attack and Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Entities and Their Interactions\n- There are at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Every human saw every donkey.\n- The statement \"A human chased Hazel only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" implies that if a human chased Hazel, then Lewis did not chase Lewis. This is a tautology because no one can chase themselves, so this condition is always true.\n- A human will attack, and Hazel didn't chase Hazel. This means that Hazel is not a human (since a human would have attacked).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyzing the Statements\n1. **A donkey saw a human.**\n   - Since every human saw every donkey, and there is at least one human and one donkey, it follows that there is at least one donkey who saw a human. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **Every donkey saw every human.**\n   - The problem does not provide information about donkeys seeing humans. We only know that every human saw every donkey, not the other way around. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **Every donkey saw a human.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, we do not have information about donkeys seeing humans. However, since there is at least one human and one donkey, and every human saw every donkey, it is possible that some donkeys saw some humans, but we cannot conclude that every donkey saw a human. This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **A donkey saw every human.**\n   - Again, we do not have information about donkeys seeing humans. This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **No donkeys saw every human.**\n   - This is the negation of the previous statement. Since we do not have information about donkeys seeing humans, we cannot conclude this statement as true either.\n\n6. **A human saw every donkey.**\n   - This is directly stated in the problem: \"Every human saw every donkey.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1.

Every human is happy.\n6. Every human drank just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Alfred is happy.\n- Hazel doesn't see Hazel, which implies Hazel is not a human (since humans can see themselves).\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the type of Alfred\n- Alfred is happy.\n- Every human is happy.\n- Therefore, Alfred could be a human or a monkey (since monkeys can also be happy).\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the type of Hazel\n- Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n- Humans can see themselves, so Hazel cannot be a human.\n- Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the statement \"No donkeys saw Lewis\"\n- This implies that Lewis is not a donkey (since donkeys would have seen him if he were a donkey).\n- Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the statement \"Every human drank just in case every monkey chased Hazel\"\n- This is a conditional statement: If every monkey chased Hazel, then every human drank.\n- We need to determine if this condition is met.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine the type of Hazel and the implications\n- Hazel is either a donkey or a monkey.\n- If Hazel is a donkey, then no monkeys chased her (since there are no monkeys chasing donkeys).\n- If Hazel is a monkey, then we need to check if every monkey chased her.\n\n#### Step 7: Determine the drinking behavior\n- If Hazel is a donkey, the condition \"every monkey chased Hazel\" is false, so the implication \"every human drank\" does not necessarily hold.\n- If Hazel is a monkey, we need to check if every monkey chased her. If they did, then every human drank.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since we don't have enough information to definitively determine if every monkey chased Hazel, we cannot conclude that every human drank with certainty.\n- However, we know that Alfred is happy, and every human is happy, so Alfred could be a human or a monkey.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - We cannot conclude this because we don't know if Alfred is a human or a monkey, and we don't know if every human drank.\n\n2. **Alfred is happy and no donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This is true because Alfred is happy (given), and no donkeys saw Lewis (given).\n\n3. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We cannot conclude this because we don't know if Alfred is a human or a monkey, and we don't know if every human drank.\n\n4. **Alfred drank.**\n   - We cannot conclude this because we don't know if Alfred is a human or a monkey, and we don't know if every human drank.\n\n5. **Lewis drank.**\n   - We cannot conclude this because we don't know if Lewis is a human or a monkey, and we don't know if every human drank.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - We cannot conclude this because we don't know if Alfred is a human or a monkey, and we don't know if every human drank, and we don't know if Hazel is a human or a monkey.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. No humans saw Alfred.\n4. Not all humans are hungry.\n5. Every donkey drank.\n6. If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans saw Alfred.\nThis directly implies that:\n- **Not all humans saw Alfred** (Statement 1) must be true.\n- **A human saw Alfred** (Statement 2) must be false.\n- **Alfred saw a human** (Statement 3) is not necessarily true or false based on this information alone.\n- **Every human saw Alfred** (Statement 4) must be false.\n- **Alfred saw every human** (Statement 5) is not necessarily true or false based on this information alone.\n\n#### Statement 6: If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\nThis is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n- If Alfred won't attack, then the condition \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel\" must hold.\n- This can be interpreted as:\n  - If Alfred won't attack, then either:\n    - Every monkey did not kick Lewis, or\n    - Every human saw Hazel.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine whether Alfred will attack or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude anything about the truth of the condition \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the given information, the only statement that must be true is:\n- **Not all humans saw Alfred** (Statement 1).\n\nThe other statements are either false or cannot be determined with the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\n1. Not all humans saw Alfred. (True)\n2. A human saw Alfred. (False)\n3. Alfred saw a human. (Cannot be determined)\n4. Every human saw Alfred. (False)\n5. Alfred saw every human. (Cannot be determined)\n6. Alfred will attack. (Cannot be determined)\n\nThus, the statement that must be true is:\n**1. Not all humans saw Alfred.**",

Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.\nThis is the negation of Statement 5. Since we cannot conclude that every donkey chased every monkey, it is possible that no donkeys chased every monkey. However, we do not have enough information to definitively state this as true.\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased a monkey.\nThe problem does not provide any information about donkeys chasing monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey chased every monkey.\nThis is a stronger form of Statement 1.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n3. Alfred is asleep only if every monkey saw Lewis.\n4. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n5. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys kicked Hazel.\nThis directly implies that no donkey has kicked Hazel. Therefore, any statement that suggests a donkey kicked Hazel must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\nThis means that at least one donkey did not kick Alfred. This does not provide information about whether any donkey did kick Alfred, but it does rule out the possibility that all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\nThis tells us that Lewis cannot be a monkey because if he were, he would have seen Hazel (since every monkey sees Lewis, and Lewis seeing Hazel would contradict the statement).\n\nSince Lewis is not a monkey, he must be either a donkey or a human. However, we know there is at least one monkey, so Lewis cannot be the only non-monkey. Therefore, Lewis must be a human.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred is asleep only if every monkey saw Lewis.\nSince Lewis is a human and not a monkey, no monkey can see Lewis. Therefore, the condition \"every monkey saw Lewis\" is false. According to the statement, Alfred is asleep only if this condition is true. Since the condition is false, Alfred cannot be asleep.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - True. Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, it is true that not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n2. **Hazel kicked every donkey.**\n   - We have no information about Hazel's actions towards donkeys, so this cannot be determined as true.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - False. We know no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n4. **Hazel kicked a donkey.**\n   - We have no information about Hazel's actions towards donkeys, so this cannot be determined as true.\n\n5. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - False. Alfred is not asleep because the condition for him being asleep is false.\n\n6. **A donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - False. We know no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1. Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.",

Every human is asleep if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.\n5. Alfred isn't asleep.\n6. It is not the case that Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the types of Alfred and Hazel\n- **Alfred isn't asleep** (Given).\n- **Hazel is not a monkey** (Given).\n\nSince Alfred isn't asleep, he cannot be a human because every human is asleep if and only if not all humans saw Hazel. Therefore, Alfred must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the type of Hazel\n- Hazel is not a monkey (Given).\n- If Hazel were a donkey, then the statement \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" would be irrelevant to the sleep status of humans.\n- If Hazel were a human, then the statement \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" would imply that not all humans saw Hazel, which would make all humans asleep. However, Alfred is not asleep, so Hazel cannot be a human.\n\nTherefore, Hazel must be a donkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the type of Lewis\n- Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n- Since Hazel is a donkey, the statement \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" does not provide information about whether Lewis is a donkey, human, or monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the sleep status of humans\n- Every human is asleep if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.\n- Since Hazel is a donkey, the condition \"not all humans saw Hazel\" is always true (because no one can see a donkey in this context).\n- Therefore, every human must be asleep.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the type of Alfred\n- Alfred isn't asleep.\n- Since every human is asleep, Alfred cannot be a human.\n- Therefore, Alfred must be a monkey.\n\n#### Step 6: Verify the consistency of the solution\n- Alfred is a monkey and is not asleep.\n- Hazel is a donkey.\n- Lewis doesn't see Hazel, and Lewis can be either a donkey, human, or monkey.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - True (Alfred isn't asleep, and Lewis doesn't see Hazel).\n\n2. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - False (Alfred isn't asleep).\n\n3. **Alfred isn't asleep but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - False (Lewis doesn't see Hazel).\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n   - False (Alfred isn't asleep, and Hazel is a donkey, so the concept of being asleep doesn't apply).\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n   - False (Alfred isn't asleep).\n\n6. **Lewis is asleep.**\n   - Cannot be determined (Lewis can be a donkey, human, or monkey, and we don't have enough information to determine his sleep status).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1. **Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**",

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel saw every monkey.\n- The information provided does not specify whether Hazel saw every monkey. We only know that Hazel saw herself, but this does not imply she saw every other monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel saw every monkey.\n\n#### Statement 4: No monkeys saw Hazel.\n- We know that \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel,\" which means some monkeys did not see Hazel, but it does not mean that no monkeys saw Hazel.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n3. Every human saw Alfred.\n4. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run.\n5. A human saw Lewis.\n6. Not all donkeys will run.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the key statements and their implications.\n- **Statement 3**: Every human saw Alfred.\n  - This means that if \\( H \\) is a human, then \\( H \\) saw Alfred.\n- **Statement 4**: If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run.\n  - Let's denote:\n    - \\( D \\) as \"all donkeys saw Hazel\"\n    - \\( C \\) as \"a human chased Hazel\"\n    - \\( L \\) as \"Lewis will run\"\n  - The statement can be written as: \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow (C \\rightarrow \\neg L) \\)\n  - This can be simplified to: \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow (\\neg C \\lor \\neg L) \\)\n- **Statement 5**: A human saw Lewis.\n  - This means there exists at least one human who saw Lewis.\n- **Statement 6**: Not all donkeys will run.\n  - This means there exists at least one donkey who will not run.\n\n#### Step 2: Evaluate the implications of the statements.\n- From **Statement 3**, we know that every human saw Alfred. Therefore, if there is at least one human, they all saw Alfred.\n- From **Statement 5**, we know that a human saw Lewis. Since there is at least one human, this statement is consistent with the others.\n- From **Statement 6**, we know that not all donkeys will run. This implies that some donkeys will run, but not all.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the conditional statement in **Statement 4**.\n- If not all donkeys saw Hazel (\\( \\neg D \\)), then a human chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run (\\( C \\rightarrow \\neg L \\)).\n- We need to consider two cases:\n  1. **Case 1**: All donkeys saw Hazel (\\( D \\)).\n     - In this case, the conditional statement \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow (\\neg C \\lor \\neg L) \\) is vacuously true because the antecedent is false.\n  2. **Case 2**: Not all donkeys saw Hazel (\\( \\neg D \\)).\n     - In this case, the statement \\( \\neg C \\lor \\neg L \\) must be true.\n     - This means either no human chased Hazel (\\( \\neg C \\)) or Lewis won't run (\\( \\neg L \\)).\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the given options.\n1. **Alfred saw every human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The problem does not provide information about what Alfred saw.\n2. **Not all humans saw Alfred.**\n   - This is false because **Statement 3** states that every human saw Alfred.\n3. **Alfred will run.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Alfred will run.\n4. **Alfred saw a human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The problem does not provide information about what Alfred saw.\n5. **No humans saw Alfred.**\n   - This is false because **Statement 3** states that every human saw Alfred.\n6. **A human saw Alfred.**\n   - This is true because **Statement 3** states that every human saw Alfred, and there is at least one human.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. A human saw Alfred.**",

It means that for every human to be asleep, at least one human must be asleep, and vice versa.\n   - Since Alfred is a human and he isn't asleep, this statement is false because not every human is asleep.\n\n3. **A human is asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred is a human and he isn't asleep.\n   - We don't have information about other humans.\n   - This statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true because there might not be any other humans who are asleep.\n\n4. **Only humans are asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred is a human and he isn't asleep.\n   - We also know Hazel isn't asleep.\n   - If Hazel is a human, then this statement is false because not all humans are asleep.\n   - If Hazel is a donkey or a monkey, this statement could still be false because we don't know if there are other humans who are asleep.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Not all humans are asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred is a human and he isn't asleep.\n   - This statement is true because at least one human (Alfred) is not asleep.\n\n6. **Every human is asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred is a human and he isn't asleep.\n   - This statement is false because Alfred is a counterexample.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5.

If Alfred is asleep, then every monkey saw Lewis.\n6. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n7. Hazel isn't asleep and Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Hazel is a monkey and isn't asleep.**\n   - From statement 7, we know Hazel is a monkey and she is not asleep.\n\n2. **No monkeys are happy.**\n   - From statement 3, we know that Hazel, being a monkey, is not happy.\n\n3. **No humans saw Hazel.**\n   - From statement 4, no humans saw Hazel. This means if anyone saw Hazel, they must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n4. **If Alfred is asleep, then every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - From statement 5, if Alfred is asleep, then every monkey saw Lewis. Since Hazel is a monkey, if Alfred is asleep, Hazel must have seen Lewis.\n\n5. **If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.**\n   - From statement 6, if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred. Since Hazel is a monkey and no monkeys are happy, this implies that no monkeys are hungry (because no monkeys are happy). Therefore, the condition \"every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred\" is vacuously true because the antecedent (every monkey is hungry) is false.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - If Alfred were asleep, then every monkey would have seen Lewis (from statement 5). However, we don't have information about whether Lewis was seen by any monkeys. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Alfred is asleep or not based on this alone. We need to consider other information.\n\n2. **Hazel isn't happy.**\n   - From statement 3, we know that no monkeys are happy. Since Hazel is a monkey, she is not happy. This statement must be true.\n\n3. **Hazel is happy.**\n   - This contradicts statement 3, so it must be false.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine the sleep status of Lewis. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude this statement.\n\n5. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n   - We know Hazel is not asleep (from statement 7). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - As discussed, if Alfred were asleep, then every monkey would have seen Lewis. However, we don't have information about whether Lewis was seen by any monkeys. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Alfred is asleep based on this alone.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2.

A donkey chased itself.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- From the information \"A donkey chased every monkey,\" it follows that there is at least one donkey that chased every monkey. Therefore, there is at least one donkey that chased a monkey.\n- **This statement must be true.**\n\n#### Statement 2: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- The information \"A donkey chased every monkey\" implies that there is at least one donkey that chased every monkey. However, it does not necessarily mean that every donkey chased a monkey.\n- **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 3: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n- The information provided does not give any indication about whether every monkey chased a particular donkey. It only states that a donkey chased every monkey, not the other way around.\n- **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys chased a monkey.\n- This directly contradicts the information \"A donkey chased every monkey.\" Since at least one donkey chased every monkey, this statement cannot be true.\n- **This statement is false.**\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- The information \"A donkey chased every monkey\" implies that there is at least one donkey that chased every monkey. However, it does not necessarily mean that every donkey chased every monkey.\n- **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- This directly contradicts the information \"A donkey chased every monkey.\" Since at least one donkey chased every monkey, this statement cannot be true.\n- **This statement is false.**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**1.

If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the implications of \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n- Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, the condition for Hazel to attack (a donkey kicking Hazel) is not met.\n- Therefore, **Hazel will not attack**.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statement \"If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n- This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n  - Part 1: \"If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n  - Part 2: \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\n- Since we already know that no donkeys kicked Hazel, the second part of the statement is always true because the condition \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is irrelevant to the truth of \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n\n- Therefore, the statement simplifies to: \"If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the implications for Alfred.\n- We need to consider whether Alfred will attack or not.\n- The problem does not provide direct information about Alfred's behavior or conditions under which Alfred might attack.\n- However, since Hazel will not attack (from Step 1), and there is no information linking Alfred's actions to Hazel's actions directly, we cannot definitively conclude whether Alfred will attack or not based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Hazel won't attack** (Statement 3) must be true.\n- The other statements (1, 2, 4, 5) cannot be definitively determined to be true based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**3.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given information. Since every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, it implies that some monkeys do chase other monkeys.

The given information only states that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, but it does not imply that every monkey chased every other monkey unconditionally. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A monkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.

If Lewis were a monkey, then every monkey would have kicked him, which contradicts the statement.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Lewis's Identity\n- Since Lewis is not a monkey, he must be either a donkey or a human.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Chasing Condition\n- **If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel**:\n  - The condition \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is always true because no one can chase themselves.\n  - Therefore, the implication simplifies to: \"Every monkey is asleep only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the Implication\n- **Every monkey is asleep only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel**:\n  - This means that if every monkey is asleep, then it must be the case that not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n  - Conversely, if all donkeys kicked Hazel, then not all monkeys are asleep.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the Sleep Status of Monkeys\n- We need to consider the possible scenarios:\n  - If all donkeys kicked Hazel, then not all monkeys are asleep.\n  - If not all donkeys kicked Hazel, then every monkey is asleep.\n\n#### Step 6: Analyze the Seeing Condition\n- **Lewis saw Alfred**: This does not provide direct information about whether Alfred is asleep or awake, but it does tell us that Alfred exists and is visible to Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Lewis is not a monkey** (from Step 2).\n- **Alfred's sleep status cannot be determined directly from the given information**.\n- **Hazel's sleep status cannot be determined directly from the given information**.\n- **The sleep status of monkeys depends on the kicking behavior of donkeys**.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Alfred isn't asleep**: Cannot be determined.\n2. **Alfred is asleep**: Cannot be determined.\n3. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep**: Cannot be determined.\n4. **Lewis is a monkey**: False (Lewis is not a monkey).\n5. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep**: Cannot be determined.\n6. **Lewis isn't a monkey**: True (Lewis is not a monkey).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n6. **Lewis isn't a monkey**.",

A monkey kicked Lewis or a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the key constraints\n- **No monkeys kicked a monkey**: This means that if a monkey kicked someone, that someone cannot be another monkey.\n- **A monkey kicked Lewis or a monkey kicked Alfred**: This means that either Lewis or Alfred was kicked by a monkey, but not both necessarily.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the implications\n- Since no monkeys kicked a monkey, if a monkey kicked someone, that someone must be either a donkey or a human.\n- Since there is at least one of each type (donkey, human, monkey), and Hazel and Lewis are happy, we need to consider the possible scenarios for who could have been kicked.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate each statement\n1. **A monkey kicked every monkey**:\n   - This is impossible because no monkeys kicked a monkey.\n\n2. **A monkey kicked a monkey**:\n   - This is also impossible because no monkeys kicked a monkey.\n\n3. **Every monkey kicked every monkey**:\n   - This is impossible because no monkeys kicked a monkey.\n\n4. **A monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it**:\n   - This is impossible because no monkeys kicked a monkey, so there are no monkeys that kicked any other monkey.\n\n5. **Every monkey kicked a monkey**:\n   - This is impossible because no monkeys kicked a monkey.\n\n6. **There is a monkey that every monkey kicked**:\n   - This is impossible because no monkeys kicked a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and the analysis, none of the statements can be true. The only consistent information is that a monkey kicked either Lewis or Alfred, and since no monkeys kicked a monkey, the statements involving monkeys kicking monkeys are all false.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**None of the statements must be true.**",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Every human is happy.\n4. Lewis is happy.\n5. If Alfred ate, then every monkey chased Hazel only if a human chased Hazel.\n6. Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n7. It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the type of Lewis\n- From point 7, we know that Lewis is not a donkey.\n- Since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and Lewis is not a donkey, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n- From point 4, Lewis is happy.\n- From point 3, every human is happy. Therefore, if Lewis is happy, he could be a human.\n- However, we need to check if Lewis can be a monkey. If Lewis were a monkey, he would still be happy, but this does not contradict any given information directly.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the implications of Alfred eating\n- Point 5 states: \"If Alfred ate, then every monkey chased Hazel only if a human chased Hazel.\"\n- This can be broken down into two parts:\n  - If Alfred ate, then (every monkey chased Hazel) implies (a human chased Hazel).\n  - This means that if Alfred ate and a human did not chase Hazel, then no monkey chased Hazel.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider Hazel's behavior\n- Point 6 states: \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\"\n- This means that no human chased Hazel (since Hazel is a human).\n\n#### Step 4: Combine the information\n- Since no human chased Hazel, and if Alfred ate, then no monkey chased Hazel (from point 5).\n- Therefore, if Alfred ate, no monkey chased Hazel.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n\n1. **A human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - False. We know Lewis is not a donkey.\n\n2. **Every human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - False. We know Lewis is not a donkey.\n\n3. **Alfred ate.**\n   - We cannot determine this from the given information. The statement about Alfred eating is conditional and does not provide enough information to conclude whether Alfred actually ate.\n\n4. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This is a tautology. It states that every human is asleep if and only if not all humans are asleep, which is always false because it is impossible for both conditions to be true simultaneously. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis ate.**\n   - We cannot determine this from the given information. The statement about Alfred eating is conditional, and we have no information about Lewis eating.\n\n6. **Every human is happy and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - True. We know from point 3 that every human is happy, and from point 7 that Lewis is not a donkey.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. Every human is happy and Lewis isn't a donkey.**",

Let's analyze the conditional statement involving Hazel.\n\n6. **Hazel isn't a donkey.**\n   - Similarly, we need more information to determine this.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Conditional Statement\n- **If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel.**\n\nLet's break this down:\n- **Not all donkeys saw Hazel**: This means there exists at least one donkey who did not see Hazel.\n- **A human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel**: This means if a human chased Hazel, then Hazel must have kicked herself.\n\nWe need to consider the implications:\n- If all donkeys saw Hazel, the conditional statement does not provide any information about Hazel's identity.\n- If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then the statement implies that if a human chased Hazel, Hazel must have kicked herself.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether Hazel is a donkey or not.

A human is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n4. Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each:**\n   - This means we have at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **A human chased a donkey that chased a donkey:**\n   - This implies there are at least two donkeys (one being chased and one chasing another).\n\n3. **A human is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel:**\n   - There is at least one happy human.\n   - Hazel does not see herself, which implies Hazel is not a human (since humans can see themselves).\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred:**\n   - At least one donkey did not see Hazel.\n   - Lewis did not see Alfred. This could mean Lewis and Alfred are different entities, and their relationship is not specified further.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **A human is happy and not all donkeys saw Hazel:**\n   - From the given information, we know a human is happy and not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n   - This statement is true.\n\n2. **Every human is happy and no donkeys saw Hazel:**\n   - We only know that at least one human is happy, not necessarily all humans.\n   - We also know that not all donkeys saw Hazel, but it does not imply that no donkeys saw Hazel.\n   - This statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and every human is happy:**\n   - We know not all donkeys saw Hazel, but we do not know if every human is happy.\n   - This statement is false.\n\n4. **A human is happy and no donkeys saw Hazel:**\n   - We know a human is happy, but we do not know if no donkeys saw Hazel.\n   - This statement is false.\n\n5. **Every donkey is happy unless every human saw Hazel:**\n   - We do not have information about the happiness of donkeys or whether every human saw Hazel.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n6. **Every donkey is happy or every human saw Hazel:**\n   - We do not have information about the happiness of donkeys or whether every human saw Hazel.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**1.

If Alfred is a human, this statement is trivially true because a human cannot chase themselves.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the conditional statement\n- **If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey chased Hazel only if not all donkeys will run**:\n  - **Lewis didn't chase Lewis**: This is always true because no entity can chase itself.\n  - Therefore, the condition \"every monkey chased Hazel only if not all donkeys will run\" must be true.\n  - This implies that if every monkey chased Hazel, then not all donkeys will run.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the running conditions\n- **Not all humans will run**: This means that at least one human will not run.\n- **Hazel isn't asleep**: This is a given fact and doesn't directly affect the chasing or running conditions.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n\n1. **Alfred chased a human**:\n   - We know that every human chased Alfred, but we don't have information about whether Alfred chased anyone. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred chased every human**:\n   - Similar to the previous statement, we don't have information about whether Alfred chased anyone. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Not all humans chased Alfred**:\n   - We know that every human chased Alfred, so this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred will run**:\n   - We don't have direct information about whether Alfred will run.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys kicked every human.\n3. Lewis kicked every human.\n4. Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n5. No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### 1. **Lewis Kicked Every Human:**\n   - This means Lewis is not a donkey because no donkeys kicked every human (Statement 2).\n\n#### 2. **Lewis Isn't a Donkey:**\n   - From the above analysis, we can conclude that Lewis is either a human or a monkey. Therefore, Statement 1 (Lewis isn't a donkey) must be true.\n\n#### 3. **Only Donkeys Drank or Every Donkey Kicked Lewis:**\n   - If Lewis is a human or a monkey, then the statement \"every donkey kicked Lewis\" must be true for the condition to hold. This is because if any donkey did not kick Lewis, then the only way the statement can be true is if no donkeys drank.\n\n#### 4. **No Donkeys Chased Alfred Only If Lewis Didn't Chase Lewis:**\n   - This is a conditional statement. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then no donkeys chased Alfred. However, since Lewis is a human or a monkey, it is impossible for Lewis to chase himself. Therefore, the condition \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is always true. Hence, no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n#### 5. **Alfred and Drinking:**\n   - The statement \"Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis\" implies that if any donkey did not kick Lewis, then no donkeys drank. Since every donkey must have kicked Lewis, it does not provide information about whether Alfred drank or not.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Statement 1 (Lewis isn't a donkey)** must be true.\n- **Statement 3 (Lewis is a donkey)** must be false.\n- **Statements 2, 4, 5, and 6** do not have enough information to determine their truth values based on the given conditions.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n1. Lewis isn't a donkey.",

We only know that no humans saw Lewis, but this does not tell us anything about Lewis's actions. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human saw Lewis.\n- This is directly contradicted by the given information \"No humans saw Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis will attack.\n- The given information states that \"A human will attack,\" but it does not specify whether Lewis is a human or what Lewis will do.

Not all monkeys will run.\n5. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n7. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Alfred saw every donkey.\n- Lewis is not a donkey, so he must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statements about humans\n- Every human saw every human that saw it. This implies that if a human \\(A\\) saw a human \\(B\\), then \\(B\\) also saw \\(A\\).\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the statements about donkeys\n- Alfred saw every donkey.\n- Not all donkeys saw Hazel, but Hazel sees Hazel.\n- If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the implications\n- Since Alfred saw every donkey, Alfred must be a human or a monkey (because if Alfred were a donkey, he would not have seen himself, which contradicts the fact that he saw every donkey).\n- Hazel sees Hazel, so Hazel must be a human (since humans see themselves, and donkeys and monkeys do not necessarily see themselves).\n\n#### Step 5: Evaluate the conditional statement\n- Not all donkeys saw Hazel, but Hazel sees Hazel.\n- If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n  - This means that if some donkeys did not see Hazel, then Hazel not chasing herself is contingent on no monkeys kicking her.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n\n1. **Every donkey saw Alfred.**\n   - False. Since Alfred saw every donkey, but not all donkeys saw Hazel, it is possible that some donkeys did not see Alfred.\n\n2. **Alfred will run.**\n   - We have no information about whether Alfred will run or not. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n3. **Alfred saw a donkey.**\n   - True. Alfred saw every donkey, so he definitely saw at least one donkey.\n\n4. **A donkey saw Alfred.**\n   - We cannot determine this from the given information. The statement \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" does not provide enough information to conclude whether any donkey saw Alfred.\n\n5. **No donkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - False. Since Alfred saw every donkey, it is possible that some donkeys saw him.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - True. Since not all donkeys saw Hazel, and we have no information suggesting that all donkeys saw Alfred, it is possible that not all donkeys saw Alfred.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **3. Alfred saw a donkey.**\n- **6. Not all donkeys saw Alfred.**",

Lewis isn't happy.\n8. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n9. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the type of Alfred\n- **Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This implies that Alfred cannot be a monkey because every monkey chased Alfred. Therefore, Alfred must be either a donkey or a human.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the type of Lewis\n- **Lewis doesn't see Hazel**: This implies that Lewis and Hazel are not the same entity. Since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there is at least one of each, Lewis and Hazel must be different types.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the conditions involving humans\n- **Not all humans are hungry**: This means there is at least one human who is not hungry.\n- **Alfred isn't hungry**: This confirms that Alfred is not a hungry human.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the conditional statements\n- **If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel is hungry**:\n  - Since not all humans are asleep, we need to consider the condition \"a human chased Lewis only if Hazel is hungry.\"\n  - If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel must be hungry.\n\n- **If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if no humans are hungry**:\n  - Since Lewis didn't chase Lewis, we need to consider the condition \"a human chased Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\"\n  - If a human chased Hazel, then no humans are hungry.\n\n#### Step 5: Combine the information\n- **Every monkey chased Alfred**: This implies that Alfred is not a monkey, as monkeys do not chase themselves.\n- **Alfred is either a donkey or a human**.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine the sleep status of Alfred\n- **If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel is hungry**:\n  - Since Alfred is not a monkey and not hungry, he could be a human or a donkey.\n  - If Alfred is a human, he could be asleep or awake.\n  - If Alfred is a donkey, he is not a human and thus not subject to the human conditions.\n\n- **If a human chased Hazel, then no humans are hungry**:\n  - Since Alfred is not hungry, he could still be a human or a donkey.\n  - If Alfred is a human and not hungry, he could be asleep or awake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the information, we can deduce the following:\n- Alfred is not a monkey.\n- Alfred could be a human or a donkey.\n- The sleep status of Alfred is not definitively determined by the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n3.

Hazel doesn't see Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n4. Only humans are hungry and Hazel isn't asleep.\n5. Only humans are hungry and Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Hazel is a monkey (from statement 5).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the actions and conditions\n- A human chased Alfred.\n- Hazel doesn't see Hazel (which is a tautology and doesn't provide new information).\n- It is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred (Lewis did not see Alfred).\n- Only humans are hungry.\n- Hazel is a monkey and is not asleep (from statement 4).\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the implications\n- Since only humans are hungry and Hazel is a monkey, Hazel cannot be hungry.\n- Hazel is a monkey and is not asleep.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the statements\n1. **A monkey is asleep.**\n   - We know Hazel is a monkey and is not asleep. However, there could be other monkeys who are asleep. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - We have no information about Alfred's state (asleep or awake). This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No monkeys are asleep.**\n   - We know Hazel is a monkey and is not asleep, but we don't have information about other monkeys. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys are asleep.**\n   - We know Hazel is a monkey and is not asleep, so at least one monkey is not asleep. This statement must be true.\n\n5. **Only monkeys are asleep.**\n   - We have no information to support this claim. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Every monkey is asleep.**\n   - We know Hazel is a monkey and is not asleep, so this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**4.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A human kicked every donkey.\n3. Hazel saw every human.\n4. If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the implications of each statement.\n\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means we have at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **A human kicked every donkey.**\n   - This implies that for every donkey, there exists at least one human who kicked it.\n\n3. **Hazel saw every human.**\n   - This means Hazel has seen all humans.\n\n4. **If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n     - If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then the condition \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is true only if \"every human saw Hazel\" is true.\n     - In other words, if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then the statement \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is equivalent to the statement \"every human saw Hazel.\"\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the given options based on the analysis.\n\n1. **Every human saw Hazel.**\n   - From the given information, we know Hazel saw every human. However, this does not necessarily mean that every human saw Hazel. We need more information to confirm this.\n\n2. **No humans saw Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts the possibility that Hazel saw every human. If Hazel saw every human, at least one human must have seen Hazel. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - This is possible, but we need to check if it aligns with the given conditions. If not all humans saw Hazel, then the statement \"every human saw Hazel\" is false. According to the conditional statement, if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then \"every monkey saw Hazel\" would also be false. However, we don't have enough information to determine if this is the case.\n\n4. **Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement. If Hazel is not a human, then a human must have seen Hazel. Conversely, if a human saw Hazel, then Hazel must not be a human. Since Hazel saw every human, it is possible that a human saw Hazel. However, we need to check if Hazel can be a human. If Hazel is a human, then the statement \"a human saw Hazel\" is true, which satisfies the biconditional. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n5. **A human saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel saw every human, it is possible that a human saw Hazel. This statement is consistent with the given information.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a human.**\n   - This is directly stated in the given information. Hazel saw every human, so this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **6. Hazel saw a human.**\n\nThe other statements are either not necessarily true or require additional information to confirm. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n**6. Hazel saw a human.**",

The happiness of donkeys and humans is mentioned, but not Alfred's.\n- **Conclusion: We cannot definitively say whether Alfred is happy or not.**\n\n#### Statement 2: A human chased Alfred.\n- This is directly stated in statement 4.\n- **Conclusion: True.**\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred chased a human.\n- There is no information provided about Alfred chasing anyone.\n- **Conclusion: Cannot be determined.**\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all humans chased Alfred.\n- This contradicts statement 4, which states that every human chased Alfred.\n- **Conclusion: False.**\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred chased every human.\n- There is no information provided about Alfred chasing anyone.\n- **Conclusion: Cannot be determined.**\n\n#### Statement 6: No humans chased Alfred.\n- This contradicts statement 4, which states that every human chased Alfred.\n- **Conclusion: False.**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**2. A human chased Alfred.**",

Every donkey kicked every monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the kicking behavior\n- **Not all donkeys kicked Lewis**: This means that at least one donkey did not kick Lewis.\n- **A donkey kicked a human**: This means that there is at least one donkey who kicked at least one human.\n- **Every donkey kicked every monkey**: This means that if there is a donkey, it has kicked every monkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the implications for Lewis\n- Since not all donkeys kicked Lewis, Lewis cannot be a monkey. If Lewis were a monkey, then every donkey would have kicked him, which contradicts the statement that not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\n- Therefore, Lewis cannot be a monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Consider the remaining possibilities for Lewis\n- Lewis can either be a human or a donkey.\n\n#### Step 5: Evaluate the statements\n1. **Lewis is a human**: This is possible, but not necessarily true.\n2. **Lewis isn't a monkey**: This must be true based on the analysis.\n3. **Lewis is a monkey**: This cannot be true.\n4. **Lewis isn't a human**: This is possible, but not necessarily true.\n5. **Lewis is a donkey**: This is possible, but not necessarily true.\n6. **Lewis isn't a donkey**: This is possible, but not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2.

A monkey chased a monkey that chased a monkey.\n4. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\"\n- This means for every monkey \\( M \\), there exists a donkey \\( D \\) such that \\( M \\) kicked \\( D \\) and \\( D \\) kicked \\( M \\).\n\n#### Statement 3: \"A monkey chased a monkey that chased a monkey.\"\n- This implies there is a chain of chasing among monkeys. For example, \\( M_1 \\) chased \\( M_2 \\), and \\( M_2 \\) chased \\( M_3 \\).\n\n#### Statement 4: \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n- This is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n  - If every monkey chased Hazel, then:\n    - Hazel kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n  - This can be interpreted as:\n    - If every monkey chased Hazel, then either:\n      - Hazel did not kick Alfred, or\n      - No monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that for every monkey \\( M \\), there is a donkey \\( D \\) such that \\( D \\) kicked \\( M \\).\n   - From the given information, we know that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, but this does not necessarily mean that a single donkey kicked every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - This would mean that for every donkey \\( D \\), there is a monkey \\( M \\) such that \\( D \\) kicked \\( M \\).\n   - The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. We only know that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, but this does not imply that every donkey kicked a monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No donkeys kicked every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that there is no donkey \\( D \\) that kicked every monkey \\( M \\).\n   - This is a stronger statement than the previous ones. Given that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, it is possible that different donkeys kicked different monkeys. Therefore, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that for every donkey \\( D \\) and every monkey \\( M \\), \\( D \\) kicked \\( M \\).\n   - This is a very strong statement and is not supported by the given information. Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - This would mean that there exists at least one donkey \\( D \\) and one monkey \\( M \\) such that \\( D \\) kicked \\( M \\).\n   - From the given information, we know that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it. This implies that there is at least one donkey that kicked a monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked a monkey.**\n   - This would mean that there is no donkey \\( D \\) and no monkey \\( M \\) such that \\( D \\) kicked \\( M \\).\n   - This contradicts the given information that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.

We only know that Hazel chased every donkey, which does not imply that every donkey chased Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey chased Hazel.\n- Similar to the previous point, there is no information provided that states any donkey chased Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys chased Hazel.\n- This statement is the opposite of Statement 4. Since we have no information about whether any donkey chased Hazel, this statement is also not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 1: Not all donkeys chased Hazel.\n- This statement is consistent with the lack of information about donkeys chasing Hazel. However, it is not necessarily true because we do not have enough information to confirm this.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel is hungry.\n- According to the given information, \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is hungry.\" We know that not all donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, the condition \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true. For the implication to hold, if every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel must be hungry.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Every donkey chased every human that chased every monkey.\n4. Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n5. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. A monkey is happy.\n7. Lewis isn't a donkey (repeated).\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Entities and Their Types:**\n   - Alfred can be a donkey, human, or monkey.\n   - Lewis can be a human or monkey (since he isn't a donkey).\n\n2. **Chasing Behavior:**\n   - Every donkey chased every human that chased every monkey.\n   - Alfred didn't chase Alfred, which implies Alfred cannot be a donkey (since a donkey would chase every human, including itself if it were a human).\n\n3. **Happiness:**\n   - A monkey is happy.\n\n### Deductions:\n- Since Alfred didn't chase Alfred, Alfred cannot be a donkey.\n- Therefore, Alfred must be either a human or a monkey.\n- Since there is at least one of each type, and Lewis isn't a donkey, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey is happy.**\n   - True. Alfred didn't chase Alfred (given), and a monkey is happy (given).\n\n2. **A monkey chased Alfred and a monkey is happy.**\n   - We know a monkey is happy, but we don't have information about whether a monkey chased Alfred. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred isn't happy.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine Alfred's happiness. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n   - We know a monkey is happy, but we don't have information about Alfred's or Lewis's happiness. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine Alfred's happiness. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred is happy and a monkey chased Alfred.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine Alfred's happiness or whether a monkey chased Alfred.

Therefore, it is impossible for only humans to attack.\n\n#### Statement 3: A human will attack.\n- This statement is false because we are given that no humans will attack. Therefore, no human will attack.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human will attack.\n- This statement is false because we are given that no humans will attack.

No donkeys chased a donkey.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased every donkey.**\n   - False. No donkeys chased a donkey.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.**\n   - False.

Every human chased every donkey that chased every donkey.\n4. No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.\n5. Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n6. No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a monkey ate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"Every donkey kicked every human.\"\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The given information states that there is at least one human that every donkey kicked, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"A donkey kicked every human.\"\n- This statement is also not necessarily true. The given information only states that there is a human that every donkey kicked, but it does not imply that there is a single donkey that kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Every donkey kicked a human.\"\n- This statement is true. The given information states that there is a human that every donkey kicked, which means that every donkey kicked at least one human. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.\"\n- This statement is a tautology. It can be rewritten as: \"Every human is asleep if and only if not all humans are asleep.\" This is logically impossible because it implies a contradiction. If every human is asleep, then all humans are asleep, which contradicts the condition that not all humans are asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"No donkeys kicked every human.\"\n- This statement is true. Since we know from the given information that there is a human that every donkey kicked, it follows that no donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"No donkeys kicked a human.\"\n- This statement is false. The given information states that there is a human that every donkey kicked, which directly contradicts this statement. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n3. Every donkey kicked a human.\n5. No donkeys kicked every human.",

If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Donkey Condition\n- **Every donkey saw every donkey that saw it.**\n  - This means if a donkey \\( D_1 \\) saw a donkey \\( D_2 \\), then \\( D_2 \\) must have seen \\( D_1 \\).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyzing Lewis\n- **Lewis saw a donkey.**\n  - This tells us that Lewis is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and he saw a donkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Conditional Statement\n- **If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.**\n  - This implies that if Lewis is a donkey, the condition about monkeys and humans seeing Hazel must hold.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n1. **A donkey saw a donkey.**\n   - Since Lewis saw a donkey, and there is at least one donkey, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw every donkey.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given condition that every donkey saw every donkey that saw it. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **A donkey saw every donkey.**\n   - This is a stronger version of the previous statement. It is not necessarily true because it implies that there is at least one donkey who saw all other donkeys, which is not guaranteed by the given conditions.\n\n4. **Every donkey saw a donkey.**\n   - Since every donkey saw every donkey that saw it, and there is at least one donkey, every donkey must have seen at least one donkey (itself). Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Every donkey saw every donkey.**\n   - This is a strong statement that implies a complete mutual visibility among all donkeys. The given condition does not guarantee this, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A donkey saw every donkey that saw it.**\n   - This is directly given in the problem statement. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. A donkey saw a donkey.\n4. Every donkey saw a donkey.\n6. A donkey saw every donkey that saw it.",

Since Alfred is not specified as a donkey or a monkey, and we know that no humans will attack, Alfred cannot be a human. If Alfred were a donkey or a monkey, there is no information suggesting that donkeys or monkeys will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: A human will attack.\n- This statement is false because we are explicitly told that no humans will attack.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human will attack.\n- This statement is false for the same reason as Statement 3.

It only states that not all humans are hungry, but it does not specify whether Alfred is a human or his hunger status. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred is hungry based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey saw Alfred.\n- This statement is true because it is given that \"every monkey saw Alfred.\"\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred saw a monkey.\n- The information provided does not mention anything about what Alfred saw. We only know what was seen by others (monkeys). Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred saw a monkey based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred saw every monkey.\n- Similar to Statement 4, the information provided does not mention anything about what Alfred saw. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred saw every monkey based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all monkeys saw Alfred.\n- This statement directly contradicts the given information that \"every monkey saw Alfred.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3.

Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\n5. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every donkey.\n- This statement implies that for every donkey \\( D \\), there exists a donkey \\( D' \\) such that \\( D' \\) kicked \\( D \\). However, the given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. We only know that every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, which is a reciprocal relationship, not a universal one.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys kicked a donkey.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every donkey.\n- This statement is stronger than the given information. The given information only states that every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, not that every donkey kicked every other donkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.\n- This statement implies that there exists a specific donkey \\( D \\) such that every other donkey \\( D' \\) kicked \\( D \\). The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. It only states that every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, which does not necessarily mean there is a single donkey that every other donkey kicked.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey kicked a donkey.\n- This statement is supported by the given information. Since every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, there must be at least one instance where a donkey kicked another donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every donkey.\n- This statement is consistent with the given information. The given information does not imply that any donkey kicked every other donkey. It only states that every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, which does not preclude the possibility that no donkey kicked every other donkey. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey kicked a donkey.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Every donkey drank.\n6. Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statements\n1. **A monkey is happy.**\n   - This means there is at least one happy monkey.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This implies that Hazel is not a donkey, because if she were, she would have seen herself, which contradicts the statement.\n\n3. **A monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - This means Alfred was kicked by a monkey. Therefore, Alfred cannot be a monkey (since monkeys are exclusive).\n\n4. **Every donkey drank.**\n   - This means all donkeys, if they exist, have drunk.\n\n5. **Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - This is a disjunction (OR statement). It means either only donkeys drank, or every donkey kicked Lewis. Since we know every donkey drank, the first part of the disjunction is true, making the entire statement true regardless of whether every donkey kicked Lewis.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n\n1. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - We know a monkey kicked Alfred, and Alfred is not a monkey. If Alfred were a donkey, he would have drunk (since every donkey drank). If Alfred were a human, we have no information about whether humans drank. However, since the statement \"only donkeys drank\" is true, Alfred must be a donkey and therefore drank. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - We know Alfred drank (as established above). However, we have no information about whether Hazel drank. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively determined as true.\n\n3. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We know Alfred drank. We have no information about whether Lewis drank. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively determined as true.\n\n4. **A monkey is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - Both parts of this statement are true based on the given information. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred drank.**\n   - As established above, Alfred must be a donkey and therefore drank. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Alfred is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - We know a monkey kicked Alfred, but we have no information about whether Alfred is happy. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively determined as true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **4. A monkey is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n- **5. Alfred drank.**",

However, we don't have enough information to determine if every donkey saw Hazel.\n- If Lewis were a human, then the condition \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless every human saw Hazel\" would be more straightforward to analyze.\n\n#### Step 4: Consider the implications of Lewis being a human\n- If Lewis is a human, then Alfred must see Lewis if every human saw Hazel.\n- Since Lewis saw Alfred, and a human will run, this implies that Lewis is likely a human because humans are involved in the chasing and running dynamics.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the visibility conditions\n- Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n- If Lewis is a human, then Alfred must see Lewis if every human saw Hazel. This means that if Alfred sees Lewis, then every human must have seen Hazel.\n- Since Hazel doesn't see Hazel, this implies that Hazel is not a human (because a human would see itself).\n\n#### Step 6: Determine the type of Hazel\n- Hazel doesn't see Hazel, so Hazel cannot be a human.\n- Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 7: Determine the type of Alfred\n- If Alfred sees Lewis, then every human must have seen Hazel.\n- Since Hazel doesn't see Hazel, Alfred must be a donkey or a monkey.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Lewis saw Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - True if Lewis is a human and saw Alfred, and Lewis does see Hazel.\n   - False if Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n2. **Hazel saw Hazel and Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - False because Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n\n3. **Hazel saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - False because Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n\n4. **Lewis saw Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - True if Lewis is a human and saw Alfred, and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n5. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - False because Lewis saw Alfred.\n\n6. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - True because Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis saw Alfred.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and deduce which statements must be true. Let's break down the information step by step.\n\n### Given Conditions:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A monkey chased a human that chased it.\n3. A monkey chased Alfred and every human chased Alfred.\n4. If a monkey kicked Hazel, then every donkey saw Hazel.\n5. If not all humans kicked Hazel, then a donkey saw Lewis.\n6. If Lewis won't run, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Condition 2: A monkey chased a human that chased it.\n- This implies a mutual chase between a monkey and a human. Let's denote this monkey as \\( M_1 \\) and the human as \\( H_1 \\).\n\n#### Condition 3: A monkey chased Alfred and every human chased Alfred.\n- This means Alfred is being chased by at least one monkey and every human. Let's denote this monkey as \\( M_2 \\) (which could be the same as \\( M_1 \\)).\n\n#### Condition 4: If a monkey kicked Hazel, then every donkey saw Hazel.\n- This is a conditional statement. We need to consider whether a monkey kicked Hazel to determine if every donkey saw Hazel.\n\n#### Condition 5: If not all humans kicked Hazel, then a donkey saw Lewis.\n- This is another conditional statement. We need to consider whether not all humans kicked Hazel to determine if a donkey saw Lewis.\n\n#### Condition 6: If Lewis won't run, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n- This is a complex conditional statement. We need to consider whether Lewis won't run and whether every human saw Hazel to determine if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n1. **Alfred chased every human.**\n   - From condition 3, we know that every human chased Alfred, but it does not imply that Alfred chased every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred chased a human.**\n   - There is no information provided that directly states Alfred chased a human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No humans chased Alfred.**\n   - This contradicts condition 3, which states that every human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **A human chased Alfred.**\n   - This is true based on condition 3, which states that every human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Not all humans chased Alfred.**\n   - This contradicts condition 3, which states that every human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Alfred will run.**\n   - There is no information provided about Alfred running. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**4. A human chased Alfred.**",

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A human is happy just in case a human is asleep.**\n   - From the analysis above, this is true. A human is happy if and only if a human is asleep.\n\n3. **A human is happy just in case every human is asleep.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The condition for a human to be happy is that at least one human is asleep, not that every human must be asleep.\n\n4. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - Since Alfred is asleep, he cannot attack.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Alfred is a monkey.\n3. Hazel saw Lewis.\n4. If not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\n5. If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\n6. Only donkeys are asleep but it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the Sleep Status of Hazel\n- From statement 6: \"Only donkeys are asleep but it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.\"\n  - This implies that Hazel is asleep.\n  - Since only donkeys are asleep, Hazel must be a donkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Implications of Hazel Being a Donkey\n- Hazel is a donkey and she saw Lewis.\n- Since Hazel is a donkey and she is asleep, this means that at least one donkey (Hazel) is asleep.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Conditional Statements\n- Statement 4: \"If not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\"\n  - Let's denote:\n    - \\( H \\): Not all humans are asleep.\n    - \\( D \\): Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n    - \\( L \\): Lewis is hungry.\n  - The statement can be written as: \\( H \\rightarrow (D \\rightarrow L) \\).\n\n- Statement 5: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\"\n  - Let's denote:\n    - \\( H \\): Not all humans are asleep.\n    - \\( L \\): Lewis is hungry.\n    - \\( N \\): No humans are hungry.\n  - The statement can be written as: \\( H \\rightarrow (L \\rightarrow N) \\).\n\n#### Step 4: Combine the Conditional Statements\n- From \\( H \\rightarrow (D \\rightarrow L) \\) and \\( H \\rightarrow (L \\rightarrow N) \\):\n  - If \\( H \\) is true (not all humans are asleep), then:\n    - \\( D \\rightarrow L \\) (if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Lewis is hungry).\n    - \\( L \\rightarrow N \\) (if Lewis is hungry, then no humans are hungry).\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the Sleep Status of Humans\n- Since Hazel is a donkey and she is asleep, and only donkeys are asleep, it follows that all humans are awake.\n- Therefore, \\( H \\) is false (all humans are asleep).\n\n#### Step 6: Evaluate the Conditional Statements with \\( H \\) False\n- When \\( H \\) is false, both \\( H \\rightarrow (D \\rightarrow L) \\) and \\( H \\rightarrow (L \\rightarrow N) \\) are vacuously true because a false antecedent makes the entire implication true regardless of the consequent.\n\n#### Step 7: Determine the Implications for Donkeys and Lewis\n- Since \\( H \\) is false, we cannot use the implications \\( D \\rightarrow L \\) and \\( L \\rightarrow N \\) to draw any conclusions about \\( D \\) or \\( L \\).\n- However, we know that Hazel is a donkey and she saw Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since Hazel is a donkey and she saw Lewis, it is possible that other donkeys also saw Lewis, but we cannot definitively conclude that all donkeys saw Lewis or that no donkeys saw Lewis based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n- **None of the given statements must be true.**\n\nHowever, if we need to choose the most likely statement based on the information provided, the closest one would be:\n- **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.** (This is because we only know that Hazel, a donkey, saw Lewis, but we do not have information about other donkeys.)\n\nBut strictly speaking, none of the statements must be true based on the given information.",

Every monkey drank.\n7. It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry (which means Lewis is hungry).\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means we have at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **A monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - Alfred is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey. Since a monkey kicked Alfred, Alfred cannot be a monkey (because the action is exclusive).\n\n3. **Every donkey drank.**\n   - All donkeys drank.\n\n4. **A monkey is hungry.**\n   - At least one monkey is hungry.\n\n5. **Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - Hazel is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey. This information doesn't directly affect the drinking status.\n\n6. **Every monkey drank.**\n   - All monkeys drank.\n\n7. **It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry (which means Lewis is hungry).**\n   - Lewis is hungry. Lewis can be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **Not all monkeys drank.**\n   - This is false because it is given that every monkey drank.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - Alfred is not a monkey (since a monkey kicked him), so Alfred could be a donkey or a human. If Alfred is a donkey, he drank (since every donkey drank). If Alfred is a human, we don't know if he drank. Lewis is hungry, but we don't know if he drank. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred drank.**\n   - Alfred is not a monkey, so he could be a donkey or a human. If Alfred is a donkey, he drank (since every donkey drank). If Alfred is a human, we don't know if he drank. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Only monkeys drank.**\n   - This is false because every donkey drank, and there is at least one donkey.\n\n5. **A monkey drank.**\n   - This is true because every monkey drank, and there is at least one monkey.\n\n6. **No monkeys drank.**\n   - This is false because every monkey drank.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5.

A human is happy and not all humans are hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Alfred and Lewis are happy**: This means both Alfred and Lewis are either donkeys, humans, or monkeys, but they are happy.\n- **A monkey chased Hazel**: This implies Hazel is not a monkey (since a monkey cannot chase itself). Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a human.\n- **A human is happy and not all humans are hungry**: This means there is at least one happy human, and there is at least one human who is not hungry.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **A human is happy and Alfred is happy**:\n   - We know a human is happy.\n   - We also know Alfred is happy.\n   - However, we do not know if Alfred is a human. He could be a donkey or a monkey.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred and Hazel are happy**:\n   - We know Alfred is happy.\n   - We do not know if Hazel is happy.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Alfred isn't asleep.\n3. Hazel chased Alfred.\n4. Not all donkeys chased Hazel.\n5. Every donkey kicked every human that kicked it.\n6. Alfred didn't chase Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey kicked every human that kicked it.\nThis statement is directly given as true. Therefore, we can use this as a fact in our analysis.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred didn't chase Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\nThis means that if every human chased Hazel, then Alfred did not chase Hazel. However, since Hazel chased Alfred, it implies that not every human chased Hazel. This is because if every human had chased Hazel, Alfred would not have chased her, which contradicts the fact that Hazel chased Alfred.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A donkey kicked every human that kicked it.**\n   - This is directly given as true (Statement 5).\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - This is a stronger statement than Statement 5. It implies that every donkey kicked every human, regardless of whether the human kicked the donkey. We do not have enough information to conclude this from the given facts.\n\n3. **A donkey kicked every human.**\n   - This is similar to Statement 2 and is also not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n4. **A donkey kicked a human.**\n   - Since every donkey kicked every human that kicked it (Statement 5), and there is at least one human (as per the given information), it follows that if any human kicked a donkey, that donkey would have kicked the human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n   - This is the negation of Statement 2. Since we cannot conclude that every donkey kicked every human, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n   - This is a stronger statement than Statement 4. It implies that every donkey kicked at least one human. While it is possible, we do not have enough information to conclude this from the given facts.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1. A donkey kicked every human that kicked it.\n4. A donkey kicked a human.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**Statements 1 and 4 must be true.**",

Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if Hazel is a human.\n5. A human saw Lewis.\n6. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the statements about Alfred and Hazel\n- **Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This is a tautology because no one can chase themselves.\n- **It is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel**: This means Hazel sees Hazel, which is also a tautology.\n\nThese two statements do not provide new information about the types of Alfred and Hazel.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the conditional statement\n- **Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if Hazel is a human**: Since Alfred doesn't see Alfred is always true, this implies that Hazel must be a human.\n\nSo, we have:\n- Hazel is a human.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the statement about Lewis\n- **A human saw Lewis**: Since Hazel is a human, Hazel saw Lewis.\n\nSo, we have:\n- Hazel (a human) saw Lewis.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the statement about monkeys\n- **Every monkey chased Alfred**: This means if there is a monkey, that monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Determine the type of Alfred\n- If Alfred were a monkey, then Alfred would have chased Alfred, which contradicts the given information that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- Therefore, Alfred cannot be a monkey.\n\nSo, we have:\n- Alfred is either a donkey or a human.\n\n### Determine the type of Lewis\n- Since a human (Hazel) saw Lewis, Lewis could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey. However, we need to check the consistency with other statements.\n\n### Check the remaining options\n1. **Alfred isn't a monkey**: True (as established).\n2. **Lewis isn't a human**: Not necessarily true. Lewis could be a human.\n3. **Alfred isn't a human**: Not necessarily true. Alfred could be a human.\n4. **Lewis is a human**: Not necessarily true.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey will run unless not all donkeys will attack.\n3. Not all donkeys will attack or no donkeys are happy.\n4. No donkeys are happy unless every donkey will attack.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Every monkey will run unless not all donkeys will attack.\"\nThis can be rewritten as:\n- If all donkeys will attack, then every monkey will run.\n- If not all donkeys will attack, then some monkeys may or may not run.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Not all donkeys will attack or no donkeys are happy.\"\nThis can be rewritten using logical equivalence:\n- If all donkeys will attack, then no donkeys are happy.\n- If some donkeys do not attack, then it does not necessarily mean donkeys are happy.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"No donkeys are happy unless every donkey will attack.\"\nThis can be rewritten as:\n- If no donkeys are happy, then not all donkeys will attack.\n- If every donkey will attack, then donkeys are happy.\n\n### Combining Statements:\nFrom Statement 4, we know:\n- If every donkey will attack, then donkeys are happy.\n- If no donkeys are happy, then not all donkeys will attack.\n\nFrom Statement 3, we know:\n- If all donkeys will attack, then no donkeys are happy.\n- If some donkeys do not attack, then it does not necessarily mean donkeys are happy.\n\nCombining these two:\n- If all donkeys will attack, then no donkeys are happy (from Statement 3).\n- If no donkeys are happy, then not all donkeys will attack (from Statement 4).\n\nThis creates a contradiction because if all donkeys will attack, then no donkeys are happy, but if no donkeys are happy, then not all donkeys will attack. Therefore, it cannot be the case that all donkeys will attack.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince it cannot be the case that all donkeys will attack, we have:\n- Not all donkeys will attack.\n- From Statement 3, if not all donkeys will attack, then it does not necessarily mean donkeys are happy.\n\nGiven that not all donkeys will attack, we can conclude:\n- No donkeys are happy (from the contrapositive of Statement 4).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n1.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Lewis didn't kick Lewis.\n4. Only humans are hungry.\n5. Hazel kicked every human.\n6. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n7. Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n8. Not all monkeys chased Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Lewis is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n- Hazel is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the given conditions\n- **Lewis didn't kick Lewis**: This implies that Lewis cannot be a human because humans can kick themselves. Therefore, Lewis is either a donkey or a monkey.\n- **Only humans are hungry**: This means that if anyone is hungry, they must be a human.\n- **Hazel kicked every human**: This means Hazel is not a human (since humans cannot kick themselves). Therefore, Hazel is either a donkey or a monkey.\n- **No donkeys kicked Hazel**: This means Hazel cannot be a donkey (since donkeys cannot kick other donkeys). Therefore, Hazel must be a monkey.\n- **Hazel didn't chase Alfred**: This means Alfred is not a monkey (since monkeys can chase other monkeys). Therefore, Alfred is either a donkey or a human.\n- **Not all monkeys chased Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel**: Since Hazel is a monkey and she kicked every human, all humans did kick Hazel. Therefore, the condition \"not all humans kicked Hazel\" is false. This means the implication \"not all monkeys chased Lewis\" must also be false. Hence, all monkeys chased Lewis.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n\n1. **If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.**\n   - Hazel is a monkey, and only humans are hungry. Therefore, Hazel cannot be hungry.\n   - The antecedent \"Hazel is hungry\" is false, making the entire statement true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - Alfred is either a donkey or a human. If Alfred is a donkey, he cannot be hungry. If Alfred is a human, he can be hungry.\n   - Lewis is either a donkey or a monkey. If Lewis is a donkey or a monkey, he cannot be hungry.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **If Hazel kicked Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.**\n   - Hazel is a monkey and cannot kick herself. Therefore, the antecedent \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" is false, making the entire statement true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).\n\n4. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - Alfred is either a donkey or a human. If Alfred is a donkey, he cannot be hungry. If Alfred is a human, he can be hungry.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Only humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - We know that only humans are hungry.\n   - We also know that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Not all humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - We know that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - However, we do not have enough information to determine if all humans are hungry or not.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5. Only humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**",

The only information we have about Alfred is that every human saw him, and about Lewis is that no donkeys saw him. This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred won't attack.\n- Similar to Statement 1, we have no direct information about whether Alfred will attack. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred will attack.\n- Again, similar to Statements 1 and 2, we have no direct information about whether Alfred will attack. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys saw Lewis and every donkey drank.\n- This statement combines two pieces of information:\n  - \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is directly given.\n  - \"Every donkey drank\" is also directly given.\n- Since both parts of this statement are true, the entire statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all donkeys drank.\n- \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" So, this statement can be rewritten as: \"Lewis saw Lewis if and only if not all donkeys drank.\"\n- We know that every donkey drank, so \"not all donkeys drank\" is false.\n- If \"not all donkeys drank\" is false, then for the statement to be true, \"Lewis saw Lewis\" must also be false.\n- However, we have no information about whether Lewis saw himself. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis will attack.\n- We have no direct information about whether Lewis will attack. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4.

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **No monkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This also contradicts the conclusion from Step 1. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This is consistent with the conclusion from Step 1.

Alfred isn't asleep and Hazel isn't asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Let's denote:\n  - \\( D \\) for donkey\n  - \\( H \\) for human\n  - \\( M \\) for monkey\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statements\n1. **There is a human that every human chased.**\n   - This implies there is a specific human who is being chased by all other humans. Let's call this human \\( X \\).\n\n2. **Every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run.**\n   - This can be interpreted as: If all donkeys are not happy, then not all donkeys will run. Conversely, if all donkeys will run, then at least one donkey is happy.\n\n3. **If Hazel is a human, then Alfred isn't a human.**\n   - This means Hazel and Alfred cannot both be humans.\n\n4. **Lewis ate and every donkey will run.**\n   - This directly states that every donkey will run.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't asleep and Hazel isn't asleep.**\n   - This tells us that both Alfred and Hazel are awake.\n\n#### Step 3: Deductions\n- From statement 4, we know that every donkey will run.\n- From statement 3, since every donkey will run, it follows that at least one donkey is happy (because if no donkeys were happy, not all donkeys would run, which contradicts statement 4).\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the options\n1. **Alfred will run.**\n   - We have no direct information about whether Alfred is a donkey, human, or monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will run.\n\n2. **No donkeys are happy.**\n   - This is false because we deduced that at least one donkey is happy.\n\n3. **Every donkey is happy.**\n   - We only know that at least one donkey is happy, but we do not have enough information to conclude that every donkey is happy.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys are happy.**\n   - This is possible, but we cannot definitively conclude this from the given information.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - This is a contradiction. Since we know from statement 4 that every donkey will run, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Only donkeys are happy.**\n   - We have no information about the happiness of humans or monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude that only donkeys are happy.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. Not all donkeys are happy.**\n\nThis is because we know that at least one donkey is happy, but we do not have enough information to conclude that every donkey is happy. Therefore, it is possible that not all donkeys are happy.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Every human saw every human that saw it.\n4. A monkey kicked a human that kicked a human.\n5. Alfred isn't asleep.\n6. Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human saw every human that saw it.\nThis is directly given in the information: \"Every human saw every human that saw it.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every human saw every human.\nThis statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. The information only states that every human saw every human that saw it, which does not imply that every human saw every other human. For example, if there are three humans A, B, and C, and A saw B and B saw A, but A did not see C, this statement would be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: A human saw a human.\nGiven that there is at least one human and every human saw every human that saw it, it follows that there must be at least one pair of humans who saw each other. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human saw a human.\nThis statement is similar to Statement 3. Since there is at least one human and every human saw every human that saw it, it follows that every human must have seen at least one other human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human saw every human.\nThis statement is the same as Statement 2, which we already determined is not necessarily true. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No humans saw every human.\nThis statement contradicts the information given. Since every human saw every human that saw it, it is possible for a human to see every other human. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. A human saw every human that saw it.\n3. A human saw a human.\n4. Every human saw a human.",

Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\"\nThis statement is directly given as true. Therefore, if there are any donkeys, they all chased Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\"\nThis is a conditional statement. It can be interpreted as:\n- If not all donkeys chased Alfred, then no donkeys chased Alfred.\n- This implies that if some donkeys did not chase Alfred, then no donkeys chased Alfred at all.\n\nHowever, since we know from Statement 2 that every donkey chased Alfred, this condition cannot be true. Therefore, the only way for this statement to hold is if all donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 1: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\"\nGiven that every donkey chased Alfred (Statement 2), this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"A donkey chased Alfred.\"\nSince every donkey chased Alfred (Statement 2), this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"No donkeys chased Alfred.\"\nThis statement contradicts Statement 2, which states that every donkey chased Alfred.

Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of this statement based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Alfred drank.\"\nAccording to Statement 3, Alfred drank unless Alfred isn't a human. This means:\n- If Alfred is a human, then Alfred drank.\n- If Alfred is not a human, then Alfred did not drink.\n\nWe need to determine whether Alfred is a human. Since there is at least one human, and Alfred could be that human, we need to consider the implications:\n- If Alfred is a human, then Alfred drank.\n- If Alfred is not a human, then Alfred did not drink.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to definitively determine whether Alfred is a human or not. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say whether Alfred drank or not.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **3.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each (donkey, human, monkey).\n3. A donkey kicked Lewis.\n4. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n5. Only humans are hungry.\n6. Not all donkeys chased Alfred and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively):**\n   - This means there are no other types of entities in the scenario.\n\n2. **There's at least one of each (donkey, human, monkey):**\n   - We have at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n3. **A donkey kicked Lewis:**\n   - There exists at least one donkey that kicked Lewis.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred:**\n   - Some donkeys did not chase Alfred.\n\n5. **Only humans are hungry:**\n   - If an entity is hungry, it must be a human.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred and not all donkeys kicked Alfred:**\n   - This reiterates that some donkeys did not chase Alfred and some donkeys did not kick Alfred.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **No donkeys kicked Alfred or no humans are hungry:**\n   - We know that only humans are hungry, so \"no humans are hungry\" is false.\n   - Therefore, for this statement to be true, \"no donkeys kicked Alfred\" must be true.\n   - However, we do not have enough information to conclude that no donkeys kicked Alfred. It could be that some donkeys kicked Alfred, but not all.\n   - **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n2. **Alfred is hungry:**\n   - Since only humans are hungry, Alfred must be a human to be hungry.\n   - However, we do not have information about Alfred's species.\n   - **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n3. **Alfred isn't hungry:**\n   - If Alfred is not a human, he cannot be hungry.\n   - However, we do not have information about Alfred's species.\n   - **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked Alfred unless no humans are hungry:**\n   - This can be rewritten as: If no humans are hungry, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\n   - We know that only humans are hungry, so \"no humans are hungry\" is false.\n   - Therefore, the antecedent (if part) of the implication is false, making the entire implication true regardless of the consequent (then part).\n   - **This statement is true.**\n\n5. **Only humans are hungry and not all donkeys kicked Alfred:**\n   - We know that only humans are hungry.\n   - We also know that not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n   - Both parts of this statement are true.\n   - **This statement is true.**\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry:**\n   - For Alfred to be hungry, he must be a human.\n   - For Lewis to be hungry, he must be a human.\n   - We do not have information about Alfred's or Lewis's species.\n   - **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **4.

Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n- From the given information, we know:\n  - A human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.\n  - Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- Therefore, if every human chased Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel, and a human is asleep.\n- Conversely, if a human is asleep, then every human chased Hazel, which implies every monkey chased Hazel.\n- Hence, a human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n- **This statement is true.**\n\n#### Statement 2: If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n- If not all humans are asleep, then not every human chased Hazel.\n- If not every human chased Hazel, then not every monkey chased Hazel.\n- Therefore, if not all humans are asleep, then it is not the case that every monkey chased Hazel.\n- The statement \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is vacuously true because the antecedent (every monkey chased Hazel) is false.\n- **This statement is true.**\n\n#### Statement 3: If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\n- If not all humans are asleep, then not every human chased Hazel.\n- If not every human chased Hazel, then not every monkey chased Hazel.\n- However, the statement \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep\" does not follow from the given information.\n- We cannot determine the sleep status of monkeys based on the given information alone.\n- **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\n- If not all humans are asleep, then not every human chased Hazel.\n- If not every human chased Hazel, then not every monkey chased Hazel.\n- Conversely, if every monkey chased Hazel, then every human chased Hazel, and all humans are asleep.\n- Therefore, not all humans are asleep if and only if not every monkey chased Hazel.\n- **This statement is false.**\n\n#### Statement 5: Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n- From the given information, we know:\n  - A human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.\n  - Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- Therefore, if every human is asleep, then every human chased Hazel, which implies every monkey chased Hazel.\n- Conversely, if every monkey chased Hazel, then every human chased Hazel, which implies every human is asleep.\n- **This statement is true.**\n\n#### Statement 6: If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n- If every human is asleep, then every human chased Hazel.\n- If every human chased Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel.\n- Therefore, if every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel.\n- The statement \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is vacuously true because the antecedent (every monkey chased Hazel) is true.\n- **This statement is true.**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1. A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n2. If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n5. Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n6. If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.",

Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Hazel is a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the chasing and kicking relationships\n- Every monkey chased every human that chased every monkey.\n- Every monkey chased Alfred (since Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred).\n- A monkey kicked Alfred.\n- Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the conditional statement\n- If not all donkeys will run, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n  - This can be broken down into two parts:\n    - Part 1: Not all donkeys will run.\n    - Part 2: Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n  - This means if not all donkeys will run, then the condition \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" implies \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the implications\n- Since every monkey chased Alfred, and a monkey kicked Alfred, we know that Alfred was both chased and kicked by at least one monkey.\n- Lewis didn't kick Alfred, so Lewis is not a monkey (since every monkey chased Alfred and thus would have kicked Alfred if they were a monkey).\n\n#### Step 5: Evaluate the statements\n1. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Alfred and Lewis will run. This statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n2. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - Alfred didn't chase Alfred (since no entity can chase itself).\n   - A monkey kicked Alfred (given).\n   - This statement is true.\n\n3. **Alfred will run.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Alfred will run. This statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n4. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Alfred won't run.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to carefully analyze the given statements and deduce the necessary conclusions. Let's break down the information step by step.\n\n### Given Statements:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n3. No donkeys saw Lewis.\n4. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n5. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. No donkeys kicked Alfred or Lewis is a donkey.\n7. A monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is a human.\n8. If a human chased Lewis, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Lewis is not a donkey, so Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the implications of the statements\n- **Statement 2**: Alfred didn't chase Alfred. This is trivially true since no entity can chase itself.\n- **Statement 3**: No donkeys saw Lewis. This means if Lewis is a human, no donkeys saw him. If Lewis is a monkey, no donkeys saw him.\n- **Statement 4**: Not all monkeys kicked Lewis. This means at least one monkey did not kick Lewis.\n- **Statement 5**: Lewis isn't a donkey. So, Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n- **Statement 6**: No donkeys kicked Alfred or Lewis is a donkey. Since Lewis is not a donkey, it follows that no donkeys kicked Alfred.\n- **Statement 7**: A monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is a human. This means if a monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel must be a human.\n- **Statement 8**: If a human chased Lewis, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel. This is a complex conditional statement. We need to consider the cases where a human chases Lewis and where they do not.\n\n#### Step 3: Deduce the necessary conclusions\n- From Statement 6, we know that no donkeys kicked Alfred. This directly implies that:\n  - **Statement 5 (No donkeys kicked Alfred) must be true**.\n\nLet's check the other statements:\n- **Statement 1 (Every donkey kicked Alfred)**: This is false because no donkeys kicked Alfred.\n- **Statement 2 (Alfred kicked a donkey)**: We have no information about Alfred kicking anyone, so this cannot be determined.\n- **Statement 3 (A donkey kicked Alfred)**: This is false because no donkeys kicked Alfred.\n- **Statement 4 (Alfred kicked every donkey)**: We have no information about Alfred kicking every donkey, so this cannot be determined.\n- **Statement 6 (A human will attack and no humans will attack)**: This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n**5. No donkeys kicked Alfred.**",

This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- This is even stronger than Statement 2. Since we have no information about donkeys kicking humans, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- This is a weaker form of Statement 3. We still have no information about donkeys kicking humans. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- This is the negation of Statement 3. Since we have no information about donkeys kicking humans, we cannot definitively say that no donkeys kicked every human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A human kicked a donkey.\n- We know that a human kicked every donkey.

No humans are hungry unless only donkeys drank.\n4. Every monkey drank.\n5. It is not the case that Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 4: Every monkey drank.\nThis is directly given in the information, so it must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey drank.\nSince every monkey drank (Statement 4), it follows that at least one monkey drank. Therefore, this statement must also be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all monkeys drank.\nThis contradicts Statement 4, which states that every monkey drank. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Only monkeys drank.\nThis would mean that no donkeys or humans drank. However, we have no information about whether donkeys or humans drank. Therefore, we cannot conclude that only monkeys drank. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred drank.\nWe need to consider the condition \"A monkey kicked Alfred unless a monkey is hungry.\" This can be interpreted as:\n- If a monkey is not hungry, then a monkey kicked Alfred.\n- If a monkey is hungry, then a monkey did not kick Alfred.\n\nHowever, we do not have information about whether a monkey is hungry or not. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Alfred was kicked or not, and consequently, we cannot determine whether Alfred drank. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Hazel drank.\nSince we cannot determine whether Alfred drank (as discussed in Statement 1), and we have no information about whether Hazel drank, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **3.

If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\n4. Only borogoves are beamish and every rath gyred.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means we have at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **There is a monkey that every donkey saw.**\n   - Let's call this monkey \\( M \\). Every donkey has seen \\( M \\).\n\n3. **If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if every human saw Hazel.**\n   - This can be broken down into two parts:\n     - If not all humans are asleep, then:\n       - Lewis is hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\n   - This implies that if all humans are asleep, the condition about Lewis being hungry does not apply.\n\n4. **Only borogoves are beamish and every rath gyred.**\n   - This statement seems to introduce new terms (borogoves, beamish, rath, gyred) that are not directly related to the main entities (donkeys, humans, monkeys). Since these terms do not provide additional constraints on the main entities, we can ignore them for the purpose of solving the problem.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **Only monkeys drank.**\n   - This statement implies that no donkeys or humans drank. We have no information to support or refute this claim based on the given conditions.\n\n2. **Lewis drank.**\n   - We have no direct information about whether Lewis drank or not. The only information about Lewis is related to his hunger, which depends on the sleep status of humans and their interaction with Hazel.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys drank.**\n   - This statement implies that at least one monkey did not drink. We have no information to support or refute this claim based on the given conditions.\n\n4. **No monkeys drank.**\n   - This statement implies that none of the monkeys drank. We have no information to support or refute this claim based on the given conditions.\n\n5. **Lewis and Hazel drank.**\n   - We have no direct information about whether Lewis or Hazel drank. The only information about Lewis is related to his hunger, and we have no information about Hazel drinking.\n\n6. **A monkey drank.**\n   - This statement implies that at least one monkey drank. We have no information to support or refute this claim based on the given conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the information provided, none of the statements can be definitively proven to be true based on the logical conditions given.

Therefore, the implication \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow (\\neg D_s \\rightarrow \\neg D_r) \\) is vacuously true and does not provide additional information.\n\nFrom Statement 4:\n- Since \\( L_c \\) (Lewis chased Lewis) is a self-referential statement, it is always true (Lewis cannot logically not chase himself). Therefore, the condition \\( \\neg L_c \\) is false, making the implication \\( \\neg L_c \\rightarrow (M_s \\rightarrow H_c) \\) vacuously true and does not provide additional information.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the statements\n\n1. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - Since every monkey chased Alfred (from Statement 5), Hazel, being a monkey, must have chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred chasing Hazel. We need to consider other implications.\n\n3. **Alfred chased Hazel.**\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred chasing Hazel. We need to consider other implications.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred and Lewis running.

We need to consider other implications.\n\n6. **Hazel chased Alfred.**\n   - Since every monkey chased Alfred (from Statement 5), Hazel, being a monkey, must have chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n6. Hazel chased Alfred.",

However, we don't have information that guarantees this happens. It is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased every human.**\n   - This would mean that for every donkey and every human, the donkey chases the human. This is a strong claim and not supported by the given information. We only know that a donkey chases a human if the human chases the donkey first.\n\n3. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - This is the negation of statement 2. It means that there is at least one donkey who does not chase every human. This is consistent with the given information because we only know that a donkey chases a human if the human chases the donkey first.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - This means that for every donkey, there is at least one human that the donkey chases. This is not necessarily true because we only know that a donkey chases a human if the human chases the donkey first.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every human.**\n   - This means there is at least one donkey who chases every human. This is not necessarily true because we only know that a donkey chases a human if the human chases the donkey first.\n\n6. **A donkey chased every human that chased it.**\n   - This is directly stated in the given information. If a human chases a donkey, then that donkey will chase that human back. This statement must be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. A donkey chased every human that chased it.**",

However, if Hazel is not a human, we cannot make any definitive statement about whether monkeys saw Lewis.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate each statement\n1. **Every donkey saw Lewis**: False, as no donkeys saw Lewis.\n2. **Not all donkeys saw Lewis**: True, because no donkeys saw Lewis.\n3. **Lewis saw a donkey**: We have no information about what Lewis saw, so this cannot be determined.\n4. **No donkeys saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey**: False, because Lewis is not a donkey.\n5. **Lewis saw every donkey**: We have no information about what Lewis saw, so this cannot be determined.\n6. **A donkey saw Lewis**: False, because no donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**2.

Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey.\n5. A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased every human.\n- This statement implies that for every human, there exists at least one donkey that chased them.\n- From the given information, we know that every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey. However, this does not necessarily mean that every donkey chased every human. It only means that if a human chased a donkey, then that donkey chased that human.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every donkey chased a human.\n- This statement implies that for every donkey, there exists at least one human that the donkey chased.\n- From the given information, we know that every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey. If there is at least one human that chased a donkey, then every donkey would chase that human.\n- Since there is at least one human and one donkey, and the condition \"every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey\" holds, it follows that every donkey must have chased at least one human.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans chased every donkey.\n- This statement implies that there is no human who chased all donkeys.\n- From the given information, we know that no donkeys chased a human that chased it. This means that if a human chased a donkey, the donkey did not chase back.\n- However, the information does not provide any direct restriction on whether a human can chase every donkey. It only restricts the chasing behavior of donkeys.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys chased a human.\n- This statement implies that no donkey chased any human.\n- From the given information, we know that every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey. This means that if a human chased a donkey, the donkey chased that human.\n- Since there is at least one human and one donkey, and the condition \"every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey\" holds, it follows that some donkeys must have chased some humans.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys chased every human.\n- This statement implies that there is no donkey that chased all humans.\n- From the given information, we know that every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey. This means that if a human chased a donkey, the donkey chased that human.\n- However, the information does not provide any direct restriction on whether a donkey can chase every human. It only restricts the chasing behavior based on the condition that a human must have chased the donkey first.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey chased every human.\n- This statement implies that for every donkey and every human, the donkey chased the human.\n- From the given information, we know that every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey. This means that if a human chased a donkey, the donkey chased that human.\n- However, this does not imply that every donkey chased every human without the condition that the human chased the donkey first.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**2.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\n3. A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\n4. No donkeys chased Alfred only if Alfred isn't a human.\n5. Not all donkeys chased Alfred if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\n6. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\"\nThis means that for every monkey \\( M \\), there exists another monkey \\( M' \\) such that \\( M \\) saw \\( M' \\) and \\( M' \\) saw \\( M \\). This implies a mutual seeing relationship among monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\"\nThis establishes a chain of chasing: Monkey \u2192 Donkey \u2192 Human.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"No donkeys chased Alfred only if Alfred isn't a human.\"\nThis can be rephrased as: If Alfred is a human, then some donkeys chased Alfred. If Alfred is not a human, then no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\"\nThis means that the condition \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is equivalent to \"Lewis saw Hazel.\"\n\n#### Statement 6: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\"\nThis can be broken down into two parts:\n- If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then the statement \"no humans are hungry\" is true only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **There is a monkey that every monkey saw.**\n   - This would mean there is a single monkey \\( M \\) such that every other monkey saw \\( M \\). However, from Statement 2, we know that every monkey saw a monkey that saw it, but this does not necessarily imply that there is a single monkey seen by all others. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No monkeys saw every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that for every monkey \\( M \\), there is at least one monkey \\( M' \\) that \\( M \\) did not see. This is consistent with the information given, especially since Statement 2 only guarantees mutual seeing, not universal seeing. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n3. **Every monkey saw every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that for every pair of monkeys \\( M \\) and \\( M' \\), \\( M \\) saw \\( M' \\). This is not supported by the given information, which only guarantees mutual seeing, not universal seeing. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **A monkey saw every monkey.**\n   - This would mean there is a single monkey \\( M \\) such that \\( M \\) saw every other monkey. This is not supported by the given information, which only guarantees mutual seeing, not universal seeing. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A monkey saw a monkey.**\n   - This is directly supported by Statement 2, which states that every monkey saw a monkey that saw it. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **No monkeys saw a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which states that every monkey saw a monkey that saw it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5. A monkey saw a monkey.**",

Not all donkeys chased Alfred and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.\n- This means that some donkeys did not chase Alfred, and Alfred is asleep.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys chased Alfred and only donkeys are asleep.\n- This confirms that Alfred is a donkey because only donkeys are asleep, and Alfred is asleep.\n\nFrom Statements 4 and 5, we can conclude:\n- **Alfred is a donkey** (Statement 3).\n\n#### Statement 2: If a human chased Hazel, then not all donkeys will run only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\n- This statement is complex, but it doesn't directly affect our current conclusions about Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 3: If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n- Since we know Alfred is a donkey, we need to consider if Lewis could also be a donkey.\n- If Lewis is a donkey, then the condition \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" must hold.\n- However, this statement doesn't provide direct information about whether Lewis is a donkey or not, so we cannot definitively determine Lewis's species from this alone.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n1. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - We know Alfred is a donkey and he is asleep, so he won't run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - Alfred is a donkey and asleep, so he won't run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - This is true based on our analysis.\n\n4. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - Since Alfred is a donkey and asleep, he won't run. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - Since Alfred is a donkey and asleep, he won't run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Alfred isn't a donkey.**\n   - This is false based on our analysis.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **3.

A monkey will attack or not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### Statement 1: No monkeys chased a monkey that chased it.\n- According to the given information, \"Every monkey chased every monkey.\" This means that if Monkey A chased Monkey B, then Monkey B also chased Monkey A. Therefore, this statement is false because there are monkeys that chased each other.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is not a monkey that every monkey chased.\n- Again, \"Every monkey chased every monkey\" implies that every monkey was chased by every other monkey. Therefore, this statement is false because every monkey is chased by every other monkey.\n\n#### Statement 3: No monkeys chased every monkey.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that \"Every monkey chased every monkey.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: A monkey chased every monkey.\n- This is consistent with the given information that \"Every monkey chased every monkey.\" Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred will attack.\n- The given information does not provide any direct information about Alfred's actions beyond the fact that he kicked Lewis. There is no information linking Alfred's actions to the behavior of monkeys or any other entity. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: No monkeys chased a monkey.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that \"Every monkey chased every monkey.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**4. A monkey chased every monkey.**",

Every human saw Alfred.\n6. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Simplify the Information\n- From point 4, \"No donkeys saw Hazel,\" we can infer that the statement \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (point 3) is redundant because it is already covered by point 4.\n- Point 5 states that every human saw Alfred. This means if there is at least one human, that human saw Alfred.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Conditional Statement\n- The conditional statement (point 6) is: \"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel.\"\n  - Let's denote:\n    - \\( D \\): Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n    - \\( H \\): Hazel kicked Alfred.\n    - \\( M \\): Every monkey saw Hazel.\n  - The statement can be written as: \\( D \\rightarrow (H \\rightarrow M) \\).\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the Statements\nWe need to determine which of the given statements must be true based on the information provided.\n\n1. **Alfred will run.**\n   - There is no information about Alfred running. We cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n2. **Hazel will run.**\n   - There is no information about Hazel running. We cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n3. **Hazel and Alfred will run.**\n   - Since we cannot conclude that either Hazel or Alfred will run, we cannot conclude this statement.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys will run and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - \"Not all monkeys will run\" is given directly (point 2).\n   - \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" is given directly (point 4).\n   - Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - There is no information about Alfred running. We cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - Since we cannot conclude that either Alfred or Hazel will run, we cannot conclude this statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n**4.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Only humans are asleep.\n4. Every donkey saw Hazel.\n5. Alfred isn't a human unless only donkeys drank.\n6. Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis doesn't see Lewis.\n7. Hazel saw Alfred and every donkey will run.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### 1. **Identify the types of entities:**\n   - There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### 2. **Analyze the conditions:**\n   - **Condition 3:** Only humans are asleep. This means donkeys and monkeys are not asleep.\n   - **Condition 4:** Every donkey saw Hazel.\n   - **Condition 5:** Alfred isn't a human unless only donkeys drank. This implies that if Alfred is a human, then only donkeys drank. If other entities (humans or monkeys) also drank, Alfred cannot be a human.\n   - **Condition 6:** Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis doesn't see Lewis. This is a contradiction because it implies that if every donkey saw Hazel, then Lewis must not see Lewis. Since every donkey saw Hazel, Lewis must not see Lewis.\n   - **Condition 7:** Hazel saw Alfred and every donkey will run.\n\n#### 3. **Determine the type of Alfred:**\n   - From Condition 5, if Alfred is a human, then only donkeys drank. However, since there is at least one human and one monkey, and only donkeys drank, this condition cannot be met. Therefore, Alfred cannot be a human.\n   - Since Alfred is not a human, he must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n#### 4. **Determine the type of Lewis:**\n   - From Condition 6, if every donkey saw Hazel, then Lewis must not see Lewis. Since every donkey saw Hazel, Lewis must not see Lewis. This is a contradiction, which implies that Lewis must be a donkey or a monkey (since humans are asleep and cannot see anything).\n\n#### 5. **Determine the running behavior:**\n   - From Condition 7, every donkey will run. Since Alfred is not a human, he must be a donkey or a monkey. If Alfred is a donkey, he will run. If Alfred is a monkey, he will not run.\n   - Hazel saw Alfred, so Hazel is awake and can see. Hazel is not a human (since only humans are asleep), so Hazel must be a donkey or a monkey. If Hazel is a donkey, she will run. If Hazel is a monkey, she will not run.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Alfred will run if he is a donkey.**\n- **Hazel will run if she is a donkey.**\n- **Lewis does not see Lewis, which is a contradiction, but it implies Lewis is not a human.**\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because we don't know if Alfred and Lewis are both donkeys.\n2. **Lewis doesn't see Lewis.**\n   - This is true based on the given conditions.\n3. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because Alfred might be a donkey.\n4. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because we don't know if both Alfred and Hazel are donkeys.\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because Alfred might be a monkey.\n6. **Lewis saw Lewis.**\n   - This is false based on the given conditions.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n**2.

Since we know there is at least one human and one monkey, and every human chases a monkey, Hazel cannot be a human and Alfred cannot be a monkey. Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey, and Alfred must be either a donkey or a human.\n\n3. **A human will run**: This statement is somewhat ambiguous but can be interpreted as \"there exists at least one human who will run.\" This does not directly affect the chasing behavior but indicates that there is at least one human.\n\n4. **Alfred isn't hungry and Lewis isn't hungry**: These statements do not provide direct information about the chasing behavior but indicate that hunger status is irrelevant to the problem.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **No humans chased a monkey**: This contradicts the given information that every human chased a monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **No humans chased every monkey**: This means that no single human chased all monkeys. This is possible because the statement \"every human chased a monkey\" only requires that each human chased at least one monkey, not necessarily all monkeys. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n3. **A human chased every monkey**: This means that there is at least one human who chased all monkeys. This is not necessarily true based on the given information. The statement \"every human chased a monkey\" only guarantees that each human chased at least one monkey, not all monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **There is a human that every monkey chased**: This means that there is at least one human who was chased by all monkeys. This is not necessarily true based on the given information. The statement \"every human chased a monkey\" does not imply anything about monkeys chasing humans. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every human chased every monkey**: This means that each human chased all monkeys. This is not necessarily true based on the given information. The statement \"every human chased a monkey\" only guarantees that each human chased at least one monkey, not all monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A human chased a monkey**: This is true based on the given information that every human chased a monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. A human chased a monkey.**",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. No humans saw a monkey.\n4. Hazel saw every monkey.\n5. Hazel chased a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Hazel saw every monkey:**\n   - This means Hazel must have seen all the monkeys that exist.\n   \n2. **No humans saw a monkey:**\n   - This implies that if Hazel is a human, Hazel cannot have seen any monkeys. However, we know Hazel saw every monkey, so Hazel cannot be a human.\n\n3. **Hazel chased a monkey:**\n   - This action does not provide additional constraints on Hazel's identity beyond the fact that Hazel saw a monkey.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Hazel is a monkey:**\n   - Since Hazel saw every monkey and no humans saw a monkey, Hazel cannot be a human. Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey. However, since Hazel chased a monkey, it is more likely that Hazel is a monkey (as donkeys typically do not chase monkeys).\n\n2. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human:**\n   - This statement is a contradiction. It states that Hazel is not a human if and only if Hazel is a human, which is logically impossible. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a human:**\n   - From the analysis, we concluded that Hazel cannot be a human because no humans saw a monkey, and Hazel saw every monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Hazel is a human:**\n   - As established, Hazel cannot be a human because no humans saw a monkey, and Hazel saw every monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human:**\n   - This statement is a contradiction. It states that if Hazel is not a human, then Hazel must be a human, which is logically impossible. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3. Hazel isn't a human.**",

The problem only states that Alfred and Lewis will attack, but does not specify anything about Alfred running.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - False, because Lewis won't run (statement 3).\n\n5. **Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - False, because Lewis is a donkey (determined from the analysis).\n\n6. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Alfred won't run.

Therefore, the second part of the disjunction (\"every donkey is happy\") must be true.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it.\n4. A human is happy.\n5. Lewis saw Alfred.\n6. Not all donkeys will run.\n7. Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of Lewis and Alfred\n- **Lewis is a donkey** (given).\n\nSince Lewis is a donkey, we need to determine what Alfred is. We know:\n- **Lewis saw Alfred** (given).\n\nFrom the rule \"No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it,\" we can infer:\n- If Alfred were a donkey, then Lewis would have seen a donkey that saw him, which contradicts the rule. Therefore, **Alfred cannot be a donkey**.\n\nSince Alfred cannot be a donkey, he must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the running behavior\n- **Not all donkeys will run** (given). This means some donkeys will run, and some will not.\n- **Lewis is a donkey** (given).\n\nFrom this, we cannot definitively say whether Lewis will run or not. However, we know that not all donkeys will run, so it is possible that Lewis will run or will not run.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the statements\n1. **Lewis will run.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude this because not all donkeys will run, and we don't have specific information about Lewis's running behavior.\n\n2. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - We don't have any information about Alfred's running behavior, so we cannot definitively conclude this.\n\n3. **Lewis doesn't see Lewis.**\n   - This is true because no donkey can see itself according to the rule \"No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it.\"\n\n4. **Lewis saw Lewis.**\n   - This is false because no donkey can see itself.\n\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - We don't have any information about Alfred's running behavior, so we cannot definitively conclude this.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude this because we don't have specific information about either Alfred's or Lewis's running behavior.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n3. **Lewis doesn't see Lewis.**",

If Alfred ate, then no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- **Hazel didn't chase Alfred**: This is not directly given, so we need to check if it can be inferred.\n- **No donkeys saw Hazel**: This is directly given as true.\n\nSince \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" is true, the first part of the statement \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred\" needs to be checked. There is no information that directly states whether Hazel chased Alfred or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say this statement is true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: A human will attack and no humans will attack.\n- This is a contradiction. It cannot be true because it states both that a human will attack and that no humans will attack, which are mutually exclusive.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n- **Not all donkeys saw Hazel**: This is true because \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" implies that none of the donkeys saw Hazel.\n- **It is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred**: This means Hazel did chase Alfred. However, there is no information given about whether Hazel chased Alfred or not.\n\nSince the second part of the statement cannot be confirmed, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- **Not all donkeys saw Hazel**: This is true because \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" implies that none of the donkeys saw Hazel.\n- **It is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This means Alfred did chase Alfred. However, it is given that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n\nThis statement is false because it contradicts the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n- **Not all donkeys saw Hazel**: This is true because \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" implies that none of the donkeys saw Hazel.\n- **Hazel didn't chase Alfred**: There is no information given about whether Hazel chased Alfred or not.\n\nSince the second part of the statement cannot be confirmed, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- **Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This is directly given as true.\n- **No donkeys saw Hazel**: This is directly given as true.\n\nBoth parts of this statement are true based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.**",

Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n6. It is not the case that Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Not all humans kicked Lewis.\n- From the given information, \"No humans kicked Lewis,\" we can directly infer that no human kicked Lewis. Therefore, it is true that not all humans kicked Lewis. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis kicked a human.\n- The information \"It is not the case that Lewis didn't kick Alfred\" implies that Lewis did kick Alfred. However, we do not know if Alfred is a human. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Lewis kicked a human based on the given information. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis kicked every human.\n- Since we only know that Lewis kicked Alfred and we do not have information about whether Alfred is a human or if Lewis kicked any other humans, we cannot conclude that Lewis kicked every human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human kicked Lewis.\n- From the given information, \"No humans kicked Lewis,\" we can directly infer that no human kicked Lewis. Therefore, it is false that every human kicked Lewis. This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human kicked Lewis or Lewis kicked Lewis.\n- We know from the given information that no humans kicked Lewis, so the first part of the disjunction (a human kicked Lewis) is false. We also know that Lewis kicked Alfred, but we do not know if Alfred is Lewis. If Alfred is not Lewis, then the second part of the disjunction (Lewis kicked Lewis) is false. Therefore, the entire disjunction is false. This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A human kicked Lewis.\n- From the given information, \"No humans kicked Lewis,\" we can directly infer that no human kicked Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1. Not all humans kicked Lewis.",

Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.\n4. Every monkey drank but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the hunger status of Lewis and Alfred\n- From statement 3: \"Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.\"\n  - This means Alfred is not hungry.\n  - It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry, which implies Lewis is hungry.\n\n- From statement 4: \"Every monkey drank but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.\"\n  - This confirms that Lewis is hungry.\n  - Every monkey drank.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the type of Lewis and Alfred\n- Since Lewis is hungry, he cannot be a donkey (donkeys are typically not described as being hungry in this context).\n- Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n- Alfred is not hungry, so he cannot be a monkey (since every monkey drank and being hungry is implied for drinking).\n- Therefore, Alfred must be either a donkey or a human.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the visibility condition\n- From statement 2: \"If Lewis doesn't see Lewis, then a donkey saw Lewis.\"\n  - This implies that if Lewis cannot see himself, then a donkey must have seen him.\n  - Since Lewis is either a human or a monkey, and there is at least one donkey, this condition can be satisfied.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the statements\n1. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - We know Alfred is not hungry, and since every monkey drank, Alfred cannot be a monkey.\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, he might not have drunk.\n   - If Alfred is a human, he might not have drunk.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred isn't hungry and every monkey drank.**\n   - We know Alfred isn't hungry.\n   - We know every monkey drank.\n   - This statement is true.\n\n3. **A monkey is hungry and Alfred drank.**\n   - We know every monkey drank, so they are not necessarily hungry.\n   - Alfred is not hungry, so he might not have drunk.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We know Lewis is hungry, so he might have drunk.\n   - Alfred is not hungry, so he might not have drunk.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Alfred drank.**\n   - We know every monkey drank, so they are not necessarily hungry.\n   - Alfred is not hungry, so he might not have drunk.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred drank.**\n   - Alfred is not hungry, so he might not have drunk.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**2.

Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **No donkeys saw Lewis**: This means if \\( D \\) represents a donkey, then \\( \\neg (D \\text{ saw } L) \\).\n2. **Lewis saw Alfred**: This means \\( L \\text{ saw } A \\).\n3. **A human will run**: This means there exists a human who will run.\n4. **Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis**: This can be interpreted as \\( \\neg (A \\text{ kicked } H) \\rightarrow (L \\text{ chased } L) \\). Since \\( L \\text{ chased } L \\) is always true (a tautology), \\( \\neg (A \\text{ kicked } H) \\) must also be true. Therefore, Alfred did not kick Hazel.\n\n### Statements to Evaluate:\n1. **No donkeys saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred**:\n   - From the given information, we know \\( L \\text{ saw } A \\). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Lewis is a donkey or Alfred doesn't see Lewis**:\n   - We need to consider two cases:\n     - If \\( L \\) is a donkey, the statement is true.\n     - If \\( L \\) is not a donkey, then \\( A \\) must not see \\( L \\). However, we have no information about whether \\( A \\) sees \\( L \\). Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis is a donkey unless Alfred doesn't see Lewis**:\n   - This can be rewritten as \\( \\neg (A \\text{ sees } L) \\rightarrow (L \\text{ is a donkey}) \\).\n   - If \\( A \\) does not see \\( L \\), then \\( L \\) must be a donkey. However, we have no information about whether \\( A \\) sees \\( L \\). Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **If Alfred doesn't see Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis**:\n   - This can be rewritten as \\( \\neg (A \\text{ sees } A) \\rightarrow (D \\text{ saw } L) \\).\n   - Since \\( A \\text{ sees } A \\) is always true (a tautology), \\( \\neg (A \\text{ sees } A) \\) is always false. Therefore, the implication is always true. However, this does not provide new information about whether a donkey saw Lewis. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Lewis is a donkey or it is not the case that Alfred doesn't see Lewis**:\n   - This can be rewritten as \\( L \\text{ is a donkey} \\lor (A \\text{ sees } L) \\).\n   - If \\( L \\) is a donkey, the statement is true.\n   - If \\( L \\) is not a donkey, then \\( A \\) must see \\( L \\). Since we have no information about whether \\( A \\) sees \\( L \\), this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred**:\n   - From the given information, we know both \\( \\neg (D \\text{ saw } L) \\) and \\( L \\text{ saw } A \\).

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey kicked Hazel.\n3. Every human chased every donkey that chased every human.\n4. Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n5. Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n6. Lewis isn't a donkey but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n7. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Hazel is an entity (could be a donkey, human, or monkey).\n- Lewis is an entity (could be a human or monkey, but not a donkey).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the actions and relationships\n- Every monkey kicked Hazel.\n- Every human chased every donkey that chased every human.\n- Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n- Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n- Lewis sees Hazel.\n- If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the conditional statement\n- \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n  - This can be broken down into two parts:\n    - Part 1: If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n    - Part 2: If every monkey chased Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis.\n  - Since Hazel doesn't see Hazel, the first part is always true.\n  - Therefore, the second part must also be true: If every monkey chased Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the type of Lewis\n- Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- Lewis sees Hazel.\n- Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n- Since Lewis isn't a donkey and sees Hazel, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n- If Lewis were a monkey, he would have kicked Hazel (since every monkey kicked Hazel). However, we know Lewis didn't kick Alfred, which suggests Lewis might not be a monkey (assuming Alfred is not Hazel).\n\nGiven the constraints, the most consistent interpretation is that Lewis is a human.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n1. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - True: Lewis sees Hazel, and it's possible that not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - False: We cannot conclude that no donkeys saw Lewis based on the given information.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - False: Lewis sees Hazel.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - False: Lewis is not a donkey.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - True: Lewis isn't a donkey, and it's possible that not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n6. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - True: Hazel doesn't see Hazel, and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **5. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n- **6. Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\nThus, the correct answers are **5 and 6**.",

This means Alfred cannot be a donkey because if he were, he would have seen himself, which contradicts the statement.\n- Therefore, Alfred must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the statements about Lewis\n- A donkey kicked Lewis. This means Lewis is not a donkey (since a donkey cannot kick itself).\n- Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the statement about the human who saw Lewis\n- A human saw Lewis. This means there is at least one human who saw Lewis.\n- Since Lewis is not a donkey, the human who saw Lewis could be anyone except a donkey.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the statement about Hazel\n- It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel. This means Hazel is not a human (since humans can see themselves).\n- Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n\n1. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - False. Alfred cannot be a donkey because no donkeys saw Alfred.\n\n2. **Every donkey saw Alfred.**\n   - False. No donkeys saw Alfred, so this statement is false.\n\n3. **Alfred saw a donkey.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine this.

Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\n5. Not all monkeys will run.\n6. It is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: \"There is not a donkey that every donkey chased.\"\nThis means that there is no single donkey that all other donkeys chased. This implies that for any donkey \\( D \\), there exists at least one donkey \\( D' \\) such that \\( D' \\) did not chase \\( D \\).\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\"\nThis means that if a donkey \\( D \\) chased every human, then every other donkey \\( D' \\) chased \\( D \\). However, from Statement 3, we know that there is no donkey that every donkey chased. Therefore, no donkey can chase every human. If a donkey \\( D \\) chased every human, then every donkey would have to chase \\( D \\), which contradicts Statement 3.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"It is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\"\nThis means that Hazel chased Alfred. Since Hazel and Alfred can be either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, we need to consider the implications of this statement in the context of the other statements.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A donkey chased a human.**\n   - This is possible but not necessarily true based on the given information. We know that no donkey chased every human, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that some donkeys chased some humans.\n\n2. **A donkey chased every human.**\n   - This is false because it directly contradicts Statement 4 and the implication from Statement 3.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - This is also false because it implies that there is at least one human that every donkey chased, which contradicts the fact that no donkey chased every human.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased every human.**\n   - This is false for the same reason as Statement 3.\n\n5. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - This is true because it aligns with the implications from Statements 3 and 4. No donkey can chase every human.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased a human.**\n   - This is false because it is possible that some donkeys chased some humans, even though no donkey chased every human.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and deduce which statements must be true. Let's break down the information step by step.\n\n### Given Conditions:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n3. A monkey kicked Alfred.\n4. A monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n5. If Alfred ate, then no humans are hungry only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n6. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\n7. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Condition 2: Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\nThis means that there is at least one donkey who did not see Hazel.\n\n#### Condition 3: A monkey kicked Alfred.\nThis tells us that at least one monkey kicked Alfred.\n\n#### Condition 4: A monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\nSince not all donkeys saw Hazel (Condition 2), it follows that no monkey kicked Hazel. This is because the condition \"every donkey saw Hazel\" is false, making the implication \"a monkey kicked Hazel\" false as well.\n\n#### Condition 5: If Alfred ate, then no humans are hungry only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\nThis is a complex conditional statement. We need to consider two cases:\n- **Case 1:** Alfred did not eat. In this case, the entire statement is vacuously true.\n- **Case 2:** Alfred ate. For the statement to be true, either no humans are hungry, or not every monkey kicked Lewis. Since we don't have enough information about the hunger status of humans or whether every monkey kicked Lewis, we cannot definitively conclude anything from this condition alone.\n\n#### Condition 6: If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\nSince not all donkeys saw Hazel (Condition 2), the antecedent is true. Therefore, the consequent must also be true:\n- Not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\nThis means that if Hazel did not kick Alfred, then all donkeys kicked Alfred. However, if Hazel did kick Alfred, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n#### Condition 7: If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\nThis is another complex conditional statement. We need to consider two cases:\n- **Case 1:** Hazel is not hungry. In this case, the entire statement is vacuously true.\n- **Case 2:** Hazel is hungry. For the statement to be true, either not all donkeys kicked Alfred, or not every human saw Hazel. Since we don't have enough information about the hunger status of Hazel or whether every human saw Hazel, we cannot definitively conclude anything from this condition alone.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis, we can deduce the following:\n- **Condition 4** tells us that no monkey kicked Hazel.\n- **Condition 6** tells us that if Hazel did not kick Alfred, then all donkeys kicked Alfred. If Hazel did kick Alfred, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\nGiven these deductions, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Hazel kicked a monkey.** - We have no information to support this.\n2. **A monkey kicked Hazel.** - This is false based on Condition 4.\n3. **Every monkey kicked Hazel.** - This is false based on Condition 4.\n4. **Alfred ate.** - We cannot definitively conclude this from the given conditions.\n5. **No monkeys kicked Hazel.** - This is true based on Condition 4.\n6. **Hazel kicked every monkey.** - We have no information to support this.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n5. No monkeys kicked Hazel.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\n3. A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\n4. If every human is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\"\nThis means for every monkey \\( M \\), there exists another monkey \\( N \\) such that \\( M \\) chased \\( N \\) and \\( N \\) chased \\( M \\). This implies a mutual chasing relationship among some monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\"\nThis introduces a specific sequence of chasing: a monkey \\( M \\) chased a donkey \\( D \\), and \\( D \\) chased a human \\( H \\).\n\n#### Statement 4: \"If every human is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\nThis is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n- If every human is asleep, then:\n  - Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n  - This can be interpreted as: If every human is asleep, then either Alfred didn't kick Hazel or not all donkeys kicked Hazel (or both).\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - This would mean there is no single monkey that was chased by all other monkeys. However, from Statement 2, we know that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, which implies some mutual chasing. This does not necessarily mean that no monkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **There is a monkey that every monkey chased.**\n   - This would mean there is a single monkey that was chased by all other monkeys. From Statement 2, we know that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, but this does not imply that there is a single monkey that all others chased. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every monkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This would mean that for every pair of monkeys \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\), \\( M_1 \\) chased \\( M_2 \\). However, Statement 2 only guarantees that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, not that every monkey chased every other monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A monkey chased a monkey.**\n   - From Statement 2, we know that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it. This directly implies that there is at least one instance where a monkey chased another monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **No monkeys chased a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which states that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **A monkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This would mean there is a single monkey that chased all other monkeys. From Statement 2, we know that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, but this does not imply that there is a single monkey that chased every other monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**4. A monkey chased a monkey.**",

Conversely, if not all humans are asleep, then it is true that every human is asleep, which is also a contradiction. Therefore, this statement is always false and does not depend on the given context.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel is a human and every donkey chased every human, it follows that every donkey chased Hazel. This statement must be true.\n\n3. **Hazel chased a donkey.**\n   - The information provided does not specify whether humans chase donkeys. Therefore, we cannot determine if Hazel chased a donkey based on the given information. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased Hazel.**\n   - Since every donkey chased every human, and Hazel is a human, it follows that every donkey chased Hazel.

Hazel isn't a human if and only if Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n4. Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel isn't a human if and only if Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\nThis is directly given in the problem. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\nThis is also directly given in the problem. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel isn't a human just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\nWe need to determine if \"Hazel isn't a human\" is equivalent to \"not all donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know:\n- Hazel isn't a human if and only if Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n\nFrom Statement 3, we know:\n- Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n- Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all donkeys chased Alfred if and only if every human chased Hazel.\nWe need to determine if \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is equivalent to \"every human chased Hazel.\"\n\nFrom Statement 3, we know:\n- Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nHowever, there is no direct information linking \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" to \"every human chased Hazel.\" Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement is necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred is asleep.\nWe need to determine if Alfred is asleep based on the given information.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know:\n- Hazel isn't a human if and only if Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n\nFrom Statement 3, we know:\n- Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nIf no donkeys chased Alfred, then Alfred didn't chase Hazel, and thus Hazel isn't a human. However, this does not directly tell us whether Alfred is asleep. We need more information about whether Alfred kicked Hazel.\n\nFrom Statement 1, we know:\n- If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then Alfred is asleep.\n\nSince we do not have information about whether Alfred kicked Hazel, we cannot definitively conclude that Alfred is asleep. Therefore, Statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if every human chased Hazel.\nWe need to determine if \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is equivalent to \"every human chased Hazel.\"\n\nAs discussed in Statement 4, there is no direct information linking \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" to \"every human chased Hazel.\" Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement is necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1. Hazel isn't a human just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n2. Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n3. Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n1. True\n2. True\n3. True\n4. False\n5. False\n6. False",

Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the types of Alfred and Lewis\n- **Alfred isn't hungry**: Since only humans are hungry, Alfred cannot be a human. Therefore, Alfred must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n- **It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry**: This means Lewis is hungry. Since only humans are hungry, Lewis must be a human.\n\n#### Step 2: Evaluate the implications of Lewis being a human\n- **Lewis is a human**: This directly contradicts statement 1 (Lewis isn't a human). Therefore, statement 1 is false.\n- **Lewis is a human**: This confirms statement 3 (Lewis is a human).\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Alfred being a donkey or a monkey\n- **Alfred isn't hungry**: Since Alfred is not a human, he must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n- **No donkeys saw Lewis**: If Alfred were a donkey, he would not have seen Lewis. However, we need to check if this is consistent with other information.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the conditional statements\n- **If every donkey saw Hazel, then not all humans kicked Hazel**:\n  - If every donkey saw Hazel, then not all humans kicked Hazel. This implies that if there is at least one donkey who did not see Hazel, then all humans could have kicked Hazel.\n- **If every monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis is hungry only if every monkey kicked Lewis**:\n  - Since Lewis is hungry, if every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey must have kicked Lewis.\n\n#### Step 5: Check consistency with the given conditions\n- **Alfred is a donkey or a monkey**:\n  - If Alfred were a donkey, he would not have seen Lewis, which is consistent with \"no donkeys saw Lewis.\"\n  - If Alfred were a monkey, he might or might not have seen Lewis, but since Lewis is hungry, if every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey must have kicked Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Lewis is a human** (Statement 3 is true).\n- **Alfred is not a human** (Statement 2 is false because Alfred is not hungry).\n- **Alfred and Lewis are not both hungry** (Statement 4 is false).\n- **Lewis and Alfred are not both hungry** (Statement 5 is false).\n- **Alfred and Hazel are not both hungry** (Statement 6 is false because Alfred is not hungry).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n3. Lewis is a human.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys saw Lewis.\n3. A donkey saw a donkey that saw a monkey.\n4. Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a monkey chased Hazel.\n5. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n6. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys saw Lewis.\nThis is directly given as a fact. Therefore, we can conclude:\n- **No donkeys saw Lewis.**\n\n#### Statement 1: Every donkey saw Lewis.\nSince no donkeys saw Lewis, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis saw every donkey.\nWe have no information about what Lewis saw, so we cannot definitively conclude this.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all donkeys saw Lewis.\nSince no donkeys saw Lewis, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey saw Lewis.\nSince no donkeys saw Lewis, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis saw a donkey.\nWe have no information about what Lewis saw, so we cannot definitively conclude this.\n\n### Additional Analysis:\nLet's consider the implications of the other statements to ensure consistency with the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey saw a donkey that saw a monkey.\nThis implies there is a chain of donkeys seeing each other and eventually a monkey. This does not contradict the fact that no donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a monkey chased Hazel.\nThis is a conditional statement. If a monkey did not chase Hazel, then Alfred sees Alfred. If a monkey did chase Hazel, then Alfred does not see Alfred. This does not provide direct information about Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 5: If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\nIf Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then the condition \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true only if every human saw Hazel. Since Lewis not chasing Lewis is a tautology (Lewis cannot chase himself), this simplifies to: not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel. This does not provide direct information about Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 6: If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\nIf not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel. This does not provide direct information about Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the given information and the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- **No donkeys saw Lewis.**\n- **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n\nThus, the correct answers are:\n- **Statement 2: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n- **Statement 4: Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n\nHowever, since the question asks for which statement must be true, and considering the options provided, the most accurate and directly supported statement is:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 4: Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Only donkeys are hungry.\n4. Not all humans kicked Lewis.\n5. Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n6. If a donkey kicked Hazel, then Alfred isn't a human.\n7. A monkey kicked Alfred.\n8. It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the types of Lewis, Alfred, and Hazel.\n- **Lewis**: From statement 8, Lewis is not a donkey. Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n- **Alfred**: From statement 7, a monkey kicked Alfred. Since only donkeys are hungry and monkeys can kick, Alfred cannot be a donkey. Therefore, Alfred must be either a human or a monkey.\n- **Hazel**: We need to determine Hazel's type based on the other statements.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the implications of the statements.\n- **Statement 5**: \"Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\"\n  - This means if Hazel is not a human, then every donkey saw Hazel.\n  - Conversely, if not every donkey saw Hazel, then Hazel must be a human.\n- **Statement 6**: \"If a donkey kicked Hazel, then Alfred isn't a human.\"\n  - If a donkey kicked Hazel, Alfred must be a monkey.\n- **Statement 7**: \"A monkey kicked Alfred.\"\n  - This confirms that Alfred is not a donkey and must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the type of Hazel.\n- If Hazel is a human, then the condition \"every donkey saw Hazel\" does not need to be satisfied.\n- If Hazel is not a human, then every donkey must have seen Hazel.\n- If a donkey kicked Hazel, then Alfred must be a monkey (from statement 6).\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the type of Alfred.\n- Since a monkey kicked Alfred, Alfred cannot be a donkey.\n- If a donkey kicked Hazel, Alfred must be a monkey.\n- If no donkey kicked Hazel, Alfred could still be a human or a monkey, but we need more information.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the type of Lewis.\n- Lewis is not a donkey, so he must be either a human or a monkey.\n- If Lewis is a human, he might or might not have kicked Alfred.\n- If Lewis is a monkey, he did not kick Alfred (since a monkey kicked Alfred, and Lewis cannot be the same monkey).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Lewis**: Must be a human or a monkey.\n- **Alfred**: Must be a monkey (since a monkey kicked Alfred and if a donkey kicked Hazel, Alfred must be a monkey).\n- **Hazel**: If Hazel is not a human, every donkey saw her. If a donkey kicked Hazel, Alfred is a monkey, which is consistent with our findings.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Lewis is hungry.** - False, because Lewis is not a donkey.\n2. **Alfred isn't hungry.** - True, because Alfred is a monkey.\n3. **Alfred is hungry.** - False, because Alfred is a monkey.\n4. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.** - False, because neither Alfred nor Lewis is a donkey.\n5. **Alfred and Hazel are hungry.** - False, because Alfred is a monkey and Hazel is not necessarily a donkey.\n6. **Lewis isn't hungry.** - True, because Lewis is not a donkey.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **Alfred isn't hungry.**\n- **Lewis isn't hungry.**\n\nThus, the correct answers are:\n2. Alfred isn't hungry.\n6. Lewis isn't hungry.",

This means donkeys and monkeys are not hungry.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the happiness condition for donkeys\n- Every donkey is happy unless every human saw Hazel.\n- Since it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel, it implies that Hazel did not see herself.\n- Therefore, not every human saw Hazel (since Hazel did not see herself).\n- Hence, every donkey is happy.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the chasing condition\n- If Lewis chased Lewis, then not all donkeys are hungry.\n- Since we have already established that donkeys are not hungry (because only humans are hungry), this condition is irrelevant because it cannot be true that not all donkeys are hungry.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the attacking condition\n- A human will attack.\n- Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n- Since a human will attack and Hazel didn't chase herself, it implies that some human will attack, but it does not specify which human.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n1. **Lewis will attack.**\n   - We know a human will attack, but it is not specified that it must be Lewis.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Hazel will attack.**\n   - We know a human will attack, but it is not specified that it must be Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Only humans are hungry and no humans will attack.**\n   - We know only humans are hungry, but we also know a human will attack.

Hazel saw Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\nThis is directly given in the problem. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\nThis is a specific instance of the general rule given in Statement 3. Since Statement 3 is true, this statement must also be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"A monkey chased a monkey.\"\nGiven that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, and there is at least one monkey, it follows that there must be at least one instance where a monkey chased another monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 1: \"Every monkey chased a monkey.\"\nThis statement is not necessarily true. While it is true that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, it does not imply that every monkey chased at least one other monkey. For example, if there is only one monkey, it cannot chase itself. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"No monkeys chased every monkey.\"\nThis statement is not necessarily true. If there are multiple monkeys, and every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, it is possible for some monkeys to chase every other monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"A monkey chased every monkey.\"\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Similar to Statement 1, while every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, it does not imply that any single monkey chased every other monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 3: Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.**\n- **Statement 6: A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.**\n- **Statement 5: A monkey chased a monkey.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**Statements 3, 5, and 6 must be true.**",

No humans will attack.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### 1. Not all humans will attack.\n- This statement is directly supported by the given information that \"no humans will attack.\" If no humans will attack, then it is true that not all humans will attack. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### 2. Only humans will attack.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that \"no humans will attack.\" Since no humans will attack, it cannot be true that only humans will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### 3. Alfred will attack.\n- We know that a human saw Alfred, but we do not have any information about whether Alfred is a human, a donkey, or a monkey. Additionally, we know that no humans will attack, but we have no information about the behavior of donkeys or monkeys. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Alfred will attack based on the given information. This statement is indeterminate.\n\n#### 4. Every human will attack.\n- This statement directly contradicts the given information that \"no humans will attack.\" Since no humans will attack, it cannot be true that every human will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### 5. A human will attack.\n- This statement also contradicts the given information that \"no humans will attack.\" Since no humans will attack, it cannot be true that a human will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### 6. Alfred and Hazel will attack.\n- We know that a human saw Alfred, but we do not have any information about whether Alfred is a human, a donkey, or a monkey. Similarly, we know that Hazel saw Hazel, but we do not have any information about whether Hazel is a human, a donkey, or a monkey. Additionally, we know that no humans will attack, but we have no information about the behavior of donkeys or monkeys. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Alfred and Hazel will attack based on the given information.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey kicked every monkey.\n3. No humans ate just in case not all donkeys drank.\n4. Not all donkeys drank if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### 1. **Every monkey kicked every monkey:**\n   - This means that if \\( M \\) is a monkey, then \\( M \\) kicked every other monkey, including itself.\n\n#### 2. **No humans ate just in case not all donkeys drank:**\n   - This can be interpreted as: If not all donkeys drank, then no humans ate.\n   - Formally: \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg H \\)\n   - Where \\( D \\) is \"all donkeys drank\" and \\( H \\) is \"some humans ate.\"\n\n#### 3. **Not all donkeys drank if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis:**\n   - This can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg D \\leftrightarrow \\neg K_L \\)\n   - Where \\( K_L \\) is \"all humans kicked Lewis.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis drank.\n- We need to determine if Lewis drank based on the given conditions. Let's consider the implications of the conditions:\n  - If \\( \\neg D \\) (not all donkeys drank), then \\( \\neg H \\) (no humans ate).\n  - If \\( \\neg D \\), then \\( \\neg K_L \\) (not all humans kicked Lewis).\n\n  However, we don't have direct information about whether Lewis drank or not. We need to consider the implications of the other statements.\n\n#### Statement 2: No humans ate if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis.\n- This is a restatement of the given condition \\( \\neg H \\leftrightarrow \\neg K_L \\). This statement is true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis ate.\n- If Lewis ate, then \\( H \\) (some humans ate). However, if \\( \\neg D \\), then \\( \\neg H \\), which contradicts \\( H \\). Therefore, if \\( \\neg D \\), Lewis cannot have eaten.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis didn't eat.\n- If Lewis didn't eat, then \\( \\neg H \\) (no humans ate). This is consistent with the condition \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg H \\). Therefore, if \\( \\neg D \\), Lewis didn't eat.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis is a donkey.\n- There is no direct information about Lewis being a donkey. We need to consider the implications of the other conditions.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis didn't drink.\n- If Lewis didn't drink, then \\( \\neg D \\) (not all donkeys drank). This is consistent with the condition \\( \\neg D \\leftrightarrow \\neg K_L \\). Therefore, if \\( \\neg D \\), Lewis didn't drink.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- From the analysis, we can see that:\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true if \\( \\neg D \\).\n  - Statement 6 is true if \\( \\neg D \\).\n\nHowever, we need to determine which statement must be true regardless of the specific values of \\( D \\) and \\( K_L \\).\n\n- **Statement 2** is a direct restatement of the given condition and must be true.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**Statement 2: No humans ate if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis.**",

Therefore, Alfred being asleep is not guaranteed.\n\n#### Statement 3: A human kicked Lewis.\n- According to the given information, every human kicked Lewis. Since there is at least one human, it follows that at least one human kicked Lewis. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No humans kicked Lewis.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that every human kicked Lewis. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis kicked a human.\n- The given information does not provide any information about Lewis kicking anyone.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. A human kicked a donkey that kicked a donkey.\n4. Every monkey kicked Lewis.\n5. No donkeys saw Hazel.\n6. Hazel saw Hazel.\n7. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities involved\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the actions and relationships\n1. **A human kicked a donkey that kicked a donkey.**\n   - This implies there is a chain of kicking involving a human and two donkeys.\n   - Let's denote the human as \\( H \\), the first donkey as \\( D_1 \\), and the second donkey as \\( D_2 \\).\n   - So, \\( H \\) kicked \\( D_1 \\), and \\( D_1 \\) kicked \\( D_2 \\).\n\n2. **Every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - This means Lewis is either a donkey or a human (since monkeys can only kick donkeys or humans, and they cannot kick other monkeys).\n\n3. **No donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This means Hazel cannot be a donkey because if Hazel were a donkey, she would have seen herself, which contradicts the statement.\n\n4. **Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - This confirms that Hazel is not a donkey (as no donkeys saw Hazel).\n\n5. **Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.**\n   - This means at least one donkey did not kick Alfred. Therefore, Alfred could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - Since every monkey kicked Lewis, and monkeys do not kick other monkeys, Lewis must be either a donkey or a human.\n   - However, if Lewis were a donkey, then the statement \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" would imply that monkeys kicked a donkey, which is possible.\n   - But since we need to determine if this must be true, we need to consider the possibility that Lewis could be a human.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Hazel is a donkey.**\n   - We have already established that Hazel cannot be a donkey because no donkeys saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a donkey.**\n   - We have already established that Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n   - Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - We know that not all donkeys kicked Alfred, so Alfred could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't a donkey.**\n   - We know that not all donkeys kicked Alfred, so Alfred could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - As discussed, Lewis could be a donkey or a human.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n**3. Hazel isn't a donkey.**",

Every human saw Alfred (repeated for emphasis).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- **Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This is consistent with the given information because if Alfred were a human, he would have chased every human that chased every monkey. However, since Alfred didn't chase himself, it implies that Alfred is not a human. Therefore, Alfred could be either a donkey or a monkey.\n- **No donkeys saw Hazel**: This is directly stated in the given information.\n\nSince both parts of this statement are consistent with the given information, Statement 1 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.\n- This statement is a tautology (a statement that is always true regardless of the truth values of its components). It essentially says \"If every human is asleep, then not all humans are asleep,\" which is logically impossible. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- **Not all donkeys saw Hazel**: This is consistent with the given information.\n- **It is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This means Alfred did chase Alfred, which contradicts the given information that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n\nSince the second part of this statement is false, Statement 3 is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- **Hazel didn't chase Alfred**: This is directly stated in the given information.\n- **No donkeys saw Hazel**: This is also directly stated in the given information.\n\nSince both parts of this statement are consistent with the given information, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n- **Not all donkeys saw Hazel**: This is consistent with the given information.\n- **It is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred**: This means Hazel did chase Alfred, which contradicts the given information that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n\nSince the second part of this statement is false, Statement 5 is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- **Not all donkeys saw Hazel**: This is consistent with the given information.\n- **Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This is also consistent with the given information.\n\nSince both parts of this statement are consistent with the given information, Statement 6 must be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1.

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **There is not a monkey that every donkey kicked.**\n   - Since no donkeys kicked any monkeys, it is true that there is not a single monkey that every donkey kicked. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This statement is a tautology.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Every monkey ate.\n4. No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\n5. A monkey is hungry.\n6. It is not the case that Lewis ate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the eating behavior\n- Every monkey ate.\n- It is not the case that Lewis ate.\n\nFrom point 6, we know that Lewis did not eat. Since every monkey ate, Lewis cannot be a monkey. Therefore, Lewis must be either a donkey or a human.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the hunger condition\n- A monkey is hungry.\n\nSince every monkey ate, the statement \"a monkey is hungry\" implies that there is a monkey who is hungry after eating. This seems contradictory unless we interpret it as a different monkey being hungry before eating. However, since the problem states that every monkey ate, we can infer that the hunger mentioned is a general condition, not necessarily post-eating.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the seeing condition\n- No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\n\nThis condition implies that no two monkeys can see each other in a mutual way. This is a bit tricky but doesn't directly affect our conclusion about Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Lewis did not eat.\n- Lewis cannot be a monkey because every monkey ate.\n- Therefore, Lewis must be either a donkey or a human.\n\nGiven the options:\n1. Lewis is hungry.\n2. Lewis isn't hungry.\n3. Lewis is a monkey.\n4. Lewis ate.\n5. Lewis isn't a monkey.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5.

However, we do not have information about whether other monkeys saw Lewis. This statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n2. **A monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - Since Lewis sees Hazel, and Hazel is a monkey, it follows that at least one monkey (Hazel) saw Lewis. This statement must be true.\n\n3. **Lewis saw a monkey.**\n   - We know Lewis sees Hazel, who is a monkey. Therefore, Lewis saw a monkey. This statement must be true.\n\n4. **Lewis saw every monkey.**\n   - We only know that Lewis saw Hazel, but we do not have information about whether Lewis saw all other monkeys. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Lewis, but we do not have information about whether all other monkeys saw Lewis.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Hazel saw Lewis.\n4. Every monkey ate.\n5. It is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred.\n6. Hazel saw Hazel.\n7. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Hazel, Lewis, and Alfred can be any of these three types.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the statements\n1. **Hazel saw Lewis**: This means Hazel and Lewis are different entities.\n2. **It is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred**: This means Hazel and Alfred are different entities.\n3. **Hazel saw Hazel**: This is a tautology and doesn't provide new information about the types of entities.\n4. **Every monkey ate**: This is a straightforward statement.\n5. **Every monkey chased Alfred**: This implies that Alfred is not a monkey (since monkeys cannot chase themselves).\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the types of Hazel, Lewis, and Alfred\n- Since Hazel saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel, Hazel is not a donkey (donkeys cannot see).\n- Since Hazel did not see Alfred, Alfred is not a donkey (donkeys cannot be seen by others).\n- Since every monkey chased Alfred, Alfred is not a monkey.\n- Therefore, Alfred must be a human.\n\n- Since Hazel saw Lewis and they are different entities, and Hazel is not a donkey, Hazel must be either a human or a monkey.\n- If Hazel were a monkey, then Hazel would have chased Alfred, which contradicts the fact that Hazel did not see Alfred. Therefore, Hazel must be a human.\n\n- Since Hazel is a human and Alfred is a human, Lewis must be the remaining type, which is a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Hazel is a human.\n- Alfred is a human.\n- Lewis is a monkey.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Alfred didn't eat**: We know Alfred is a human, and the problem does not specify whether humans ate or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n2. **Alfred ate**: Similarly, we do not have information about whether humans ate. This statement is not necessarily true.\n3. **Alfred and Lewis ate**: We know every monkey ate, so Lewis (a monkey) ate. However, we do not know if Alfred (a human) ate. This statement is not necessarily true.\n4. **Alfred and Hazel ate**: We know Hazel is a human, and the problem does not specify whether humans ate. This statement is not necessarily true.\n5. **Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel**: We know every monkey ate, and Hazel saw Hazel is a tautology. This statement is true.\n6. **Every monkey ate but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel**: This is a contradiction because Hazel saw Hazel is a tautology. This statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n**5. Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.**",

Alternatively, if there is at least one happy donkey, then not every donkey kicked Lewis.\n\n4. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans kicked Lewis.**\n   - This can be interpreted as: If not all humans kicked Lewis, then every human is asleep.

It does not necessarily mean that every donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- This is even stronger than the second piece of information. The second piece of information only guarantees that for each human, there is at least one donkey that kicked them, not that every donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey kicked a human.\n- This is directly supported by the second piece of information, which states that a donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- This is the negation of the second piece of information. Since the second piece of information states that a donkey kicked every human, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: There is a donkey that every human kicked.\n- This is not directly supported by the given information.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Hazel is a monkey.\n3. If a human chased Lewis, then every donkey saw Hazel.\n4. If a monkey saw Alfred, then not all donkeys are hungry.\n5. If a human chased Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey only if every monkey is hungry.\n6. Not all humans will run and every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Hazel is a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the implications of the statements\n\n**Statement 3: If a human chased Lewis, then every donkey saw Hazel.**\n- This means that if a human chased Lewis, then all donkeys must have seen Hazel.\n\n**Statement 4: If a monkey saw Alfred, then not all donkeys are hungry.**\n- This means that if any monkey saw Alfred, then there is at least one donkey that is not hungry.\n\n**Statement 5: If a human chased Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey only if every monkey is hungry.**\n- This means that if a human chased Lewis and Lewis is a donkey, then all monkeys must be hungry.\n\n**Statement 6: Not all humans will run and every monkey chased Alfred.**\n- This means that there is at least one human who will not run, and every monkey has chased Alfred.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the implications for each statement\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n- Since every monkey chased Alfred (from Statement 6), Hazel, being a monkey, must have chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- We know from Statement 6 that not all humans will run. However, we do not have enough information to determine if Alfred (who could be a donkey, human, or monkey) and Lewis (who could be a donkey, human, or monkey) will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel chased Alfred.\n- From Statement 6, we know that every monkey chased Alfred. Since Hazel is a monkey, she must have chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n- We do not have any information about whether Alfred chased Hazel. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred chased Hazel.\n- We do not have any information about whether Alfred chased Hazel. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred will run.\n- We do not have enough information to determine if Alfred will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3. Hazel chased Alfred.**",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each (donkey, human, monkey).\n3. Lewis will attack.\n4. Every human saw every monkey that saw it.\n5. A human will run.\n6. Every human saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **No humans saw every monkey.**\n   - This statement suggests that no human saw all the monkeys. However, we know from the given information that \"Every human saw every monkey that saw it.\" This means that if a monkey saw a human, that human saw that monkey. This does not necessarily mean that a human saw every monkey, only those that saw them. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A human saw every monkey that saw it.**\n   - This is directly stated in the given information: \"Every human saw every monkey that saw it.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Every human saw every monkey.**\n   - This statement is stronger than the given information. The given information only states that every human saw every monkey that saw it, not every monkey in general. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A human saw a monkey.**\n   - Since there is at least one human and one monkey, and every human saw every monkey that saw it, it is possible that a monkey saw a human, which would mean that human saw that monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Every human saw a monkey.**\n   - This statement is similar to statement 4 but applies to all humans. Since there is at least one monkey and every human saw every monkey that saw it, it is possible that at least one monkey saw a human, meaning that human saw that monkey. However, it does not guarantee that every human saw a monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A human saw every monkey.**\n   - This statement is identical to statement 3 and is not necessarily true for the same reasons.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **2. A human saw every monkey that saw it.**\n- **4. A human saw a monkey.**\n\nThese are the only statements that are guaranteed to be true based on the given information.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Lewis doesn't see Alfred.\n3. Every monkey chased a donkey that chased it.\n4. A human kicked a human that kicked a monkey.\n5. Every donkey saw Hazel only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: Every monkey chased a donkey that chased it.\nThis implies a mutual chasing relationship between monkeys and donkeys. If a monkey \\( M \\) chased a donkey \\( D \\), then \\( D \\) must have chased \\( M \\).\n\n#### Statement 4: A human kicked a human that kicked a monkey.\nThis implies a chain of actions involving humans and a monkey. Let's denote the humans as \\( H_1 \\) and \\( H_2 \\), and the monkey as \\( M \\). The sequence is \\( H_1 \\) kicked \\( H_2 \\), and \\( H_2 \\) kicked \\( M \\).\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey saw Hazel only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\nThis introduces a conditional relationship. If all monkeys chased Lewis, then no donkey saw Hazel. If not all monkeys chased Lewis, then every donkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - This means there is at least one donkey that did not chase every monkey.\n   - From Statement 3, we know that if a monkey \\( M \\) chased a donkey \\( D \\), then \\( D \\) chased \\( M \\). However, this does not imply that \\( D \\) chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n2. **No donkeys chased a monkey.**\n   - This means no donkey chased any monkey.\n   - This contradicts Statement 3, which states that every monkey chased a donkey that chased it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This means every donkey chased all monkeys.\n   - This is a strong claim and is not supported by the given information. Statement 3 only implies mutual chasing, not that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - This means every donkey chased at least one monkey.\n   - From Statement 3, we know that if a monkey \\( M \\) chased a donkey \\( D \\), then \\( D \\) chased \\( M \\). Since there is at least one monkey and one donkey, and they must chase each other, this statement is true.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This means there is at least one donkey that chased all monkeys.\n   - This is a stronger claim than Statement 4 and is not necessarily true based on the given information. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - This means there is at least one donkey that chased at least one monkey.\n   - From Statement 3, we know that if a monkey \\( M \\) chased a donkey \\( D \\), then \\( D \\) chased \\( M \\). Since there is at least one monkey and one donkey, and they must chase each other, this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **4.

If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### 1. **Identify the types of entities:**\n   - There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### 2. **Analyze the first statement:**\n   - \"A human saw a monkey that saw a monkey.\"\n   - This implies there is at least one human and at least two monkeys (since one monkey saw another).\n\n#### 3. **Analyze the second statement:**\n   - \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n   - Hazel cannot be a donkey because no donkeys saw Hazel.\n   - Hazel cannot be a human because humans can see themselves (Hazel doesn't see Hazel).\n   - Therefore, Hazel must be a monkey.\n\n#### 4. **Analyze the third statement:**\n   - \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless every donkey will attack.\"\n   - This implies that if any donkey kicks Alfred, then all donkeys must attack.\n\n#### 5. **Analyze the fourth statement:**\n   - \"Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\"\n   - Since Hazel is a monkey, this statement is vacuously true because the antecedent (Hazel isn't a human) is true, and the consequent (every donkey saw Hazel) does not need to be evaluated.\n\n#### 6. **Analyze the fifth statement:**\n   - \"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n   - If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred seeing himself depends on whether any monkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - Since Hazel is a monkey, if no monkeys kicked Hazel, then Alfred seeing himself is possible.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Every donkey saw a human.**\n   - We have no information that directly supports this. It is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw a human.**\n   - We have no information that directly supports this. It is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No donkeys saw every human.**\n   - This is a stronger statement than \"no donkeys saw a human.\" It is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A donkey saw a human.**\n   - We have no information that directly supports this. It is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every donkey saw every human.**\n   - This is a very strong statement and we have no information that directly supports this. It is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A donkey saw every human.**\n   - This is a stronger statement than \"a donkey saw a human.\" It is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the information provided, none of the statements can be definitively proven to be true based on the given conditions. However, the most plausible and least restrictive statement that could be true is:\n\n**4. A donkey saw a human.**\n\nThis is because it is the least restrictive and aligns with the possibility that there is at least one donkey and one human, and it is possible for a donkey to see a human without contradicting any of the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**4.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze it step by step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Every monkey saw a human.\n4. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n5. A monkey kicked Alfred.\n6. Alfred isn't a human unless every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the relationships\n- **Every monkey saw a human**: This means that for every monkey, there exists at least one human that the monkey saw.\n- **Lewis isn't a donkey**: Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n- **A monkey kicked Alfred**: This implies that Alfred was kicked by a monkey.\n- **Alfred isn't a human unless every donkey chased Alfred**: This is a conditional statement. If Alfred is a human, then every donkey must have chased Alfred. If Alfred is not a human, then it doesn't matter whether the donkeys chased him or not.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the type of Alfred\n- If Alfred were a human, then every donkey must have chased Alfred. However, we don't have information about donkeys chasing Alfred, so we can't definitively say Alfred is a human.\n- If Alfred is not a human, he could be either a donkey or a monkey. Since a monkey kicked Alfred, Alfred cannot be a monkey (because a monkey cannot kick itself). Therefore, Alfred must be a donkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the type of Lewis\n- Since Lewis isn't a donkey, and Alfred is a donkey, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 5: Evaluate the statements\n1. **No humans saw every monkey**: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have information about whether humans saw all monkeys or not.\n2. **A monkey saw a human**: This is true based on the given information that every monkey saw a human.\n3. **Every human saw a monkey**: This is not necessarily true. We don't have information about whether every human saw a monkey.\n4. **A human saw every monkey**: This is not necessarily true. We don't have information about whether any human saw all monkeys.\n5. **Every human saw every monkey**: This is not necessarily true. We don't have information about whether every human saw all monkeys.\n6. **A human saw a monkey**: This is not necessarily true. We don't have information about whether any human saw a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2. A monkey saw a human.**\n\nThis is because the problem explicitly states that every monkey saw a human. Therefore, there must be at least one instance where a monkey saw a human.",

No donkeys kicked Alfred unless not all donkeys will attack.\n4. If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\n5. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n6. Alfred isn't hungry and Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"There is a monkey that every donkey kicked.\"\n- This statement is directly given as true. Therefore, we know that there exists at least one monkey that every donkey has kicked.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless not all donkeys will attack.\"\n- This can be interpreted as: If all donkeys kicked Alfred, then all donkeys will attack. However, since we don't have information about whether all donkeys will attack, we cannot definitively conclude anything about whether donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\"\n- This is a complex conditional statement. We need to consider two cases:\n  - If all humans are asleep, the statement is vacuously true.\n  - If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry. Since Alfred isn't hungry, this doesn't provide direct information about whether Alfred kicked Hazel or the hunger status of monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n- This is another complex conditional statement. We need to consider two cases:\n  - If all donkeys kicked Alfred, the statement is vacuously true.\n  - If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel. This doesn't provide direct information about whether Hazel kicked Hazel or the kicking behavior of donkeys.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Alfred isn't hungry and Lewis is a donkey.\"\n- This is given as true. Therefore, Alfred is not hungry, and Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n1. **No donkeys kicked every monkey.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that there is a monkey that every donkey kicked. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the given information only states that there is at least one monkey that every donkey kicked, not that every donkey kicked every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No donkeys kicked a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that there is a monkey that every donkey kicked. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the given information only states that there is at least one monkey that every donkey kicked, not that a single donkey kicked every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **There is a donkey that every monkey kicked.**\n   - The given information does not provide any information about whether there is a donkey that every monkey kicked. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - This is true because the given information states that there is a monkey that every donkey kicked, which implies that at least one donkey kicked at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n**6. A donkey kicked a monkey.**",

Therefore, Hazel must be a monkey.\n   - Monkeys do not chase humans that chased them, but we don't have information about whether Alfred chased Hazel.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Alfred didn't chase Alfred**:\n   - From the given information, we know \\( \\neg \\forall d \\in D (S(d, \\text{Hazel})) \\).\n   - We need to check if \\( \\neg C(\\text{Alfred}, \\text{Alfred}) \\) is true.\n   - Since Alfred is not a human (because he is not hungry), he must be a donkey or a monkey.\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, he could chase himself, but if he is a monkey, he would not chase himself.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred**:\n   - From the given information, we know \\( \\neg \\forall d \\in D (S(d, \\text{Hazel})) \\).\n   - We need to check if \\( C(\\text{Hazel}, \\text{Alfred}) \\) is true.\n   - Since Hazel is a monkey, she could chase Alfred if Alfred is a donkey.\n   - This statement is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel**:\n   - From the given information, we know \\( \\neg \\forall d \\in D (C(d, \\text{Alfred})) \\).\n   - We already know \\( \\neg S(\\text{Hazel}, \\text{Hazel}) \\) is true.\n   - This statement is true.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred**:\n   - From the given information, we know \\( \\neg \\forall d \\in D (S(d, \\text{Hazel})) \\).\n   - We need to check if \\( C(\\text{Alfred}, \\text{Alfred}) \\) is true.\n   - Since Alfred is not a human, he could be a donkey or a monkey.\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, he could chase himself, but if he is a monkey, he would not chase himself.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel**:\n   - From the given information, we know \\( \\neg \\forall d \\in D (S(d, \\text{Hazel})) \\).\n   - We need to check if \\( \\neg C(\\text{Hazel}, \\text{Alfred}) \\) is true.\n   - Since Hazel is a monkey, she could chase Alfred if Alfred is a donkey.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n4. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**",

If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the implications of the given statements.\n- **Statement 4**: \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" This means that for every donkey \\( D \\), \\( D \\) did not see Hazel. Therefore, the statement \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true because no donkeys saw Hazel at all.\n\n#### Step 2: Evaluate the conditional statement.\n- **Statement 5**: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n  - Let's denote:\n    - \\( H \\): Not all humans are asleep.\n    - \\( A \\): Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n    - \\( D \\): Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n  - The statement can be written as: \\( H \\rightarrow (A \\rightarrow D) \\).\n\nSince we already know from Statement 4 that \\( D \\) (Not all donkeys saw Hazel) is true, the implication \\( A \\rightarrow D \\) is always true regardless of the truth value of \\( A \\). Therefore, the entire statement \\( H \\rightarrow (A \\rightarrow D) \\) is also always true.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the options.\n1. **Every donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - False, because no donkeys saw Hazel (Statement 4).\n\n2. **Hazel saw every donkey.**\n   - We have no information about what Hazel saw, so we cannot determine this.\n\n3. **A donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - False, because no donkeys saw Hazel (Statement 4).\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - True, because no donkeys saw Hazel (Statement 4).\n\n5. **Hazel saw a donkey.**\n   - We have no information about what Hazel saw, so we cannot determine this.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - The first part is true (Not all donkeys saw Hazel), but we have no information about whether Hazel saw Hazel, so we cannot determine this.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**4.

If a monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred is asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n- From the given information, we know that every donkey chased every monkey. However, this does not imply that there is a donkey that every monkey chased. The direction of chasing is from donkeys to monkeys, not the other way around. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every monkey chased every donkey.\n- The given information does not provide any direct information about monkeys chasing donkeys. We only know that every donkey chased every monkey, but not the reverse. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- This statement is false because the given information explicitly states that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\n#### Statement 4: There is not a donkey that every monkey chased.\n- As explained in Statement 1, the direction of chasing is from donkeys to monkeys, not the other way around. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- The given information states that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, it is true that every donkey chased a monkey. This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased a monkey.\n- This statement is false because the given information explicitly states that every donkey chased every monkey.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze it step by step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No monkeys chased Hazel.\n3. A monkey chased a monkey that chased a human.\n4. If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n5. A human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel.\n6. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: No monkeys chased Hazel.\nThis directly tells us that no monkey chased Hazel. Therefore, statements 4 and 5 cannot be true because they both imply that some monkeys chased Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey chased a monkey that chased a human.\nThis implies that there is a chain of chasing involving monkeys and humans. Let's denote the entities involved as follows:\n- \\( M_1 \\) is a monkey that chased another monkey \\( M_2 \\).\n- \\( M_2 \\) is a monkey that chased a human \\( H \\).\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- \\( M_1 \\) chased \\( M_2 \\).\n- \\( M_2 \\) chased \\( H \\).\n\nSince \\( M_2 \\) chased a human, and no monkeys chased Hazel, \\( H \\) cannot be Hazel. Therefore, \\( H \\) is a different human.\n\n#### Statement 4: If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\nThis is a conditional statement. We need to consider two cases:\n- If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n- If some donkeys chased Alfred, then the statement does not provide any information about Lewis chasing himself.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel.\nThis means that a human saw Hazel if and only if Lewis saw Hazel. This implies that either both saw Hazel or neither saw Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 6: If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\nThis is another conditional statement. We need to consider two cases:\n- If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n- If Lewis is not a donkey, then the statement does not provide any information about the relationship between monkeys and humans seeing Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Not all monkeys chased Hazel.**\n   - True, because no monkeys chased Hazel (Statement 2).\n\n2. **Hazel chased every monkey.**\n   - False, because we have no information about Hazel chasing any monkeys.\n\n3. **Hazel chased a monkey.**\n   - False, because we have no information about Hazel chasing any monkeys.\n\n4. **Every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - False, because no monkeys chased Hazel (Statement 2).\n\n5. **A monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - False, because no monkeys chased Hazel (Statement 2).\n\n6. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - We cannot determine this from the given information. The statement about donkeys chasing Alfred does not provide enough information to conclude whether Alfred is a donkey or not.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1. Not all monkeys chased Hazel.",

Therefore, at least one human kicked a monkey. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **A human kicked every monkey.**\n   - Statement 2 does not imply that every human kicked every monkey. It only states that every human kicked some monkey that kicked them back. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No humans kicked a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts statement 2, which states that every human kicked a monkey that kicked it. This statement is false.\n\n4. **No humans kicked every monkey.**\n   - This is consistent with statement 2, which only states that every human kicked some monkey that kicked them back, not every monkey. This statement is true.\n\n5. **There is a human that every monkey kicked.**\n   - Statement 2 does not provide information about whether there is a human that every monkey kicked.

Alfred drank and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Drinking Conditions\n- **Alfred drank** (given).\n- **Every monkey drank** (given).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Seeing Conditions\n- **A human saw Lewis** (given).\n- **Lewis doesn't see Hazel** (given).\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Conditional Statement\n- **Alfred doesn't see Hazel if and only if not all donkeys drank**.\n  - This means:\n    - If Alfred doesn't see Hazel, then not all donkeys drank.\n    - If not all donkeys drank, then Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n\nSince **Lewis doesn't see Hazel**, we need to check if this implies anything about Alfred seeing Hazel.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the Implications\n- Since **Lewis doesn't see Hazel**, and the condition is that Alfred doesn't see Hazel if and only if not all donkeys drank, we need to consider the implications:\n  - If **not all donkeys drank**, then Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n  - If **all donkeys drank**, then Alfred sees Hazel.\n\nHowever, we don't have direct information about whether Alfred sees Hazel or not. We only know that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n#### Step 5: Evaluate Each Statement\n1. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - False, because it is given that Alfred drank.\n\n2. **A human saw Lewis and Alfred drank.**\n   - True, because both conditions are given.\n\n3. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - True, because Alfred drank (given) and we need to check if Lewis drank. Since a human saw Lewis and every monkey drank, and Lewis doesn't see Hazel, it is consistent with the given information that Lewis could be a human or a donkey who drank.\n\n4. **Lewis drank.**\n   - True, because if a human saw Lewis and every monkey drank, and Lewis doesn't see Hazel, it is consistent that Lewis could be a human or a donkey who drank.\n\n5. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Alfred drank.**\n   - False, because Alfred did drink.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - We cannot determine this for sure. We know Alfred drank, but we don't have information about whether Hazel drank or not.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **2. A human saw Lewis and Alfred drank.**\n- **3. Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n- **4. Lewis drank.**\n\nThese statements are consistent with the given information and the logical implications derived from it.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A monkey saw every human.\n3. Hazel chased every donkey.\n4. Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.\n5. Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a human saw Hazel.\n6. A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 4: Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.\nThis is a tautology and always true. It doesn't provide new information about Hazel's identity.\n\n#### Statement 6: A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\nThis implies that Hazel did chase Hazel. This is a contradiction because Hazel cannot chase itself. Therefore, this statement must be false. This means Hazel is not a monkey.\n\n### Possible Identities for Hazel:\n- Hazel cannot be a monkey (from the contradiction).\n- Hazel could be a human or a donkey.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel chased every donkey.\nIf Hazel is a donkey, then Hazel would have to chase itself, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Hazel cannot be a donkey. Thus, Hazel must be a human.\n\n### Conclusion from Hazel's Identity:\n- Hazel is a human.\n\n#### Statement 2: A monkey saw every human.\nSince Hazel is a human, every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n1. **Every monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - True, because every monkey saw every human, and Hazel is a human.\n\n2. **Hazel saw every monkey.**\n   - We don't have information about whether Hazel saw every monkey. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - False, because every monkey saw every human, and Hazel is a human.\n\n4. **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - False, because every monkey saw every human, and Hazel is a human.\n\n5. **Hazel saw a monkey.**\n   - We don't have information about whether Hazel saw any monkeys. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - True, because every monkey saw every human, and Hazel is a human.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1.

Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n5. If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the key relationships and constraints.\n- **Every human kicked a donkey that kicked it**: This implies a mutual kicking relationship between humans and donkeys.\n- **A human is happy**: This is a given fact, but it doesn't directly affect the kicking relationships.\n- **Lewis didn't kick Alfred**: This tells us something about the specific actions of Lewis and Alfred.\n- **If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel**: This is a complex conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n  - If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then:\n    - Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n    - This is true only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the implications of the conditional statement.\n- If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then:\n  - Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n  - This is true only if every human saw Hazel.\n- This means that if Alfred did kick Hazel, the statement does not provide any information about the donkeys' actions towards Hazel.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n1. **A donkey kicked every human**:\n   - This is not necessarily true because the information only states that every human kicked a donkey that kicked it, not that every donkey kicked every human.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked every human**:\n   - This is even stronger than the previous statement and is not supported by the given information.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked a human**:\n   - This is possible but not necessarily true. The information only states that every human kicked a donkey that kicked it, which implies that some donkeys were kicked by humans, but not necessarily all donkeys.\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked a human**:\n   - This is false because the information states that every human kicked a donkey that kicked it, which implies that some donkeys did kick humans.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked a human**:\n   - This is true. Since every human kicked a donkey that kicked it, at least one donkey must have kicked a human.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked every human**:\n   - This is true. The information does not support the idea that every donkey kicked every human. It only supports that some donkeys were kicked by humans.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **5. A donkey kicked a human**\n- **6. No donkeys kicked every human**\n\nThese are the only statements that are definitively supported by the given information.",

It is not the case that Lewis drank.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Lewis or Alfred drank:**\n   - This means at least one of them drank. However, we also know that it is not the case that Lewis drank. Therefore, Alfred must have drunk.\n\n2. **Hazel and Alfred are asleep:**\n   - This tells us that both Hazel and Alfred are currently asleep.\n\n3. **Alfred isn't hungry:**\n   - This is additional information about Alfred's state but does not directly affect the drinking status.\n\n4. **It is not the case that Lewis drank:**\n   - This directly contradicts the possibility that Lewis drank. Therefore, Lewis did not drink.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since Lewis did not drink and at least one of Lewis or Alfred drank, it must be that Alfred drank.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Lewis drank.**\n   - False, because it is explicitly stated that Lewis did not drink.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - False, because Lewis did not drink.\n\n3. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - False, because we concluded that Alfred did drink.\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - We only know that Alfred drank, but we have no information about whether Hazel drank. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n5. **Alfred drank.**\n   - True, based on our analysis.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n**5. Alfred drank.**",

Every monkey drank and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every human.\n- This would mean that for every human, there exists a donkey that kicked them.\n- However, we know from the given information that \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it.\" This implies a reciprocal action, not a universal action by donkeys on humans.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys kicked a human.\n- This would mean that no donkey kicked any human.\n- However, we know that \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it,\" which means if a human kicked a donkey, the donkey would kick back.\n- Since there is at least one human and one donkey, and humans can kick donkeys, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- This would mean that there is no single donkey that kicked every human.\n- This is consistent with the information that \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it,\" as it does not imply that a single donkey kicked all humans, but rather that each donkey kicks the specific human that kicked it.\n- Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- This would mean that each donkey kicked every human.\n- As discussed, \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it\" implies a reciprocal action, not a universal action by donkeys on humans.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a donkey that every human kicked.\n- This would mean that there is a single donkey that was kicked by every human.\n- The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. It only states that donkeys kick humans who kick them, not that there is a single donkey that all humans kick.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey kicked a human.\n- This would mean that at least one donkey kicked at least one human.\n- From the information \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it,\" we know that if a human kicked a donkey, the donkey would kick back.\n- Since there is at least one human and one donkey, and humans can kick donkeys, it follows that at least one donkey must have kicked a human.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n6.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. Hazel doesn't see Alfred.\n4. A donkey kicked a human that kicked it.\n5. Lewis saw every donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- If no donkeys saw Lewis, then Lewis cannot be a donkey (since a donkey would have seen itself).\n- However, we know from the given information that Lewis saw every donkey. This means that if Lewis is not a donkey, he must be either a human or a monkey.\n- Since Lewis saw every donkey, it implies that at least one donkey exists and Lewis saw it.\n- Therefore, the statement \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" contradicts the fact that Lewis saw every donkey. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every donkey saw Lewis.\n- This statement directly contradicts the given information that Lewis saw every donkey. It is not possible for both statements to be true simultaneously.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis saw a donkey.\n- We are explicitly told that Lewis saw every donkey. Therefore, it is true that Lewis saw at least one donkey.\n- This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey saw Lewis.\n- We need to determine if it is possible for a donkey to see Lewis.\n- Since Lewis saw every donkey, it is possible that a donkey could see Lewis. However, the given information does not explicitly state that a donkey saw Lewis.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n- This statement suggests that there is at least one donkey that did not see Lewis.\n- However, we are told that Lewis saw every donkey, which implies that every donkey was visible to Lewis.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys saw Lewis.\n- This statement directly contradicts the possibility that a donkey could see Lewis.\n- Since Lewis saw every donkey, it is possible that a donkey could see Lewis.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3.

Lewis saw Alfred and every monkey saw Alfred.\n5. Every donkey is happy unless Hazel doesn't see Alfred.\n6.

If Hazel doesn't see Alfred, then not all donkeys are happy.\n   - **Statement 6:** \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel and Lewis isn't happy.\"\n     - Hazel did not chase herself, which is a tautology and doesn't provide new information. Lewis is not happy, so Lewis cannot be a human (since only humans are happy).\n\n### Deductions:\n- Since Lewis is not happy, Lewis cannot be a human. Therefore, Lewis must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n- Since every monkey saw Alfred and Lewis saw Alfred, Lewis could be a monkey. However, if Lewis were a donkey, he would still see Alfred, but we need to check the happiness condition.\n- If Lewis were a donkey, he would be happy unless Hazel doesn't see Alfred. Since Lewis is not happy, Hazel must not see Alfred. This means not all donkeys are happy.\n- Since Hazel doesn't see Alfred, every donkey is not necessarily happy. Therefore, Lewis could be a donkey who is not happy.\n\n### Analyze the Statements:\n1. **Alfred saw a monkey.**\n   - We know every monkey saw Alfred, but we don't have information about whether Alfred saw any monkeys. This statement is not necessarily true.\n2. **No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every monkey saw Alfred. This statement is false.\n3. **A monkey saw Alfred.**\n   - This is true because every monkey saw Alfred.\n4. **Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every monkey saw Alfred. This statement is false.\n5. **Alfred drank.**\n   - We know only humans drank. If Alfred drank, Alfred must be a human. However, we don't have direct information about Alfred's type. This statement is not necessarily true.\n6. **Alfred saw every monkey.**\n   - We don't have information about whether Alfred saw every monkey.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. Every human is happy.\n4. Lewis is happy.\n5. Hazel isn't hungry if and only if no humans are hungry.\n6. Hazel saw Hazel.\n7. Only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the type of Hazel\n- Hazel saw Hazel. This implies Hazel is not a donkey because only donkeys are asleep, and an awake entity cannot see itself if it is asleep.\n- Therefore, Hazel must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the hunger condition\n- Hazel isn't hungry if and only if no humans are hungry.\n- Since every human is happy, and happiness does not necessarily imply hunger, we need to consider the logical implication:\n  - If Hazel is not hungry, then no humans are hungry.\n  - If Hazel is hungry, then at least one human is hungry.\n\nSince every human is happy, and happiness does not directly correlate with hunger, we can infer that the hunger condition is consistent with the given information. However, we need to check if Hazel being a human or a monkey affects this.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the type of Hazel based on the hunger condition\n- If Hazel were a human, then Hazel would be happy (since every human is happy).\n- If Hazel were a monkey, Hazel could be either happy or not happy, but the hunger condition still holds.\n\nGiven that Hazel saw Hazel and is not asleep, Hazel must be either a human or a monkey. However, since every human is happy, if Hazel is a human, Hazel must be happy.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the statements\n1. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and every human is happy.**\n   - False, because Hazel saw Hazel.\n\n2. **A human is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - False, because Hazel saw Hazel.\n\n3. **Hazel saw Hazel and every human is happy.**\n   - True, because Hazel saw Hazel and every human is happy.\n\n4. **A human is happy but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - False, because Hazel saw Hazel.\n\n5. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This is a contradiction. If every human is asleep, then all humans are asleep, which contradicts the statement \"not all humans are asleep.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - This is a contradiction. If not all donkeys will run, then it cannot be true that every donkey will run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3. Hazel saw Hazel and every human is happy.**",
