However, we know that every monkey chased Alfred, which contradicts this statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements that must be true:\n\n- Statement 1 is not necessarily true, as we don't know if Alfred chased a monkey.\n- Statement 2 is not necessarily true, as we don't know if all monkeys chased Alfred.\n- Statement 3 is not necessarily true, as we don't know if Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- Statement 4 is not necessarily true, as we don't know if a monkey chased Alfred.\n- Statement 5 is not necessarily true, as we know that not all monkeys chased Alfred.\n- Statement 6 is not necessarily true, as we know that every monkey chased Alfred.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that statement 2 is the only one that must be true.

Not all humans chased Hazel: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information about the behavior of humans towards Hazel.\n\n2. Hazel chased a human: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have any information about Hazel's behavior towards humans.\n\n3.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively) - This means that there are only three types of entities: donkeys, humans, and monkeys. Since there's at least one of each, we can conclude that there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. Only donkeys ate - This means that humans and monkeys did not eat.\n\n3. A human saw a human that saw a human - This means that there is a human who saw another human, and that human was seen by a third human.

Hazel saw Hazel and not all donkeys will run - This means that Hazel saw herself, and there is at least one donkey that will not run.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Hazel didn't eat - This is not necessarily true. We don't have any information about Hazel's eating habits.\n\n2. Hazel won't run - This is not necessarily true. We know that not all donkeys will run, but we don't know if Hazel is a donkey or not.\n\n3. Hazel ate - This is not necessarily true. We don't have any information about Hazel's eating habits.\n\n4.

Alfred isn't hungry and Hazel saw Alfred - We know Alfred isn't hungry, but we don't know if Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n4. Hazel will run - We can't conclude this. We don't know if Hazel will run.\n\n5. Alfred will run - We can't conclude this. We don't know if Alfred will run.\n\n6. Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred - We know Alfred isn't hungry, but we don't know if Hazel saw Alfred.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that:\n\n- If Alfred will run, then every monkey is hungry. \n- If every monkey is hungry, then every human saw Hazel. \n- We know that no humans will run.\n- We know that there is at least one human.\n\nFrom the last three statements, we can conclude that every human saw Hazel. \n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the options:\n\n1. Alfred won't run - We can't conclude this.\n\n2. Alfred and Hazel will run - We can't conclude this.\n\n3. Alfred isn't hungry and Hazel saw Alfred - We know Alfred isn't hungry, but we don't know if Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n4. Hazel will run - We can't conclude this.\n\n5.

Alfred won't run - We can't conclude this.\n\n2. Alfred and Hazel will run - We can conclude this. If every monkey is hungry, then every human saw Hazel. We know that no humans will run.

However, we cannot conclude that a human kicked Alfred (statement 5) because it is possible that the human who will attack is not the one who kicked Alfred.\n\n- Since there is a human who will attack (from statement 6) and there is a human who did not chase every other human (from statement 4), it is possible that there is a human who did not chase every other human. However, this does not provide any information about whether all humans kicked Alfred.\n\n- Since there is a human who will attack (from statement 6) and there is a human who did not chase every other human (from statement 4), it is possible that there is a human who did not chase every other human. However, this does not provide any information about whether all humans kicked Alfred.\n\n- Since there is a human who will attack (from statement 6) and there is a human who did not chase every other human (from statement 4), it is possible that there is a human who did not chase every other human.

However, we cannot conclude that not all humans kicked Alfred (statement 1) because it is possible that the human who will attack is the one who kicked Alfred.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not necessarily true. However, we can conclude that statement 2 is true.",

Hazel is a monkey - This means that Hazel is one of the three types of entities.\n\nFrom the given information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since there is at least one human and no humans will run, there must be at least one human who is asleep (from statement 3).\n- Since there is at least one human who is asleep, and no humans will run, it is not the case that every monkey will run (from statement 3).\n- Since every monkey will run or a human is asleep, and there is at least one human who is asleep, it is not the case that every monkey will run.\n- Since there is at least one human who is asleep, and no humans will run, it is not the case that Alfred will run (from statement 5).\n- Since there is at least one human who is asleep, and no humans will run, it is not the case that Alfred will run.\n- Since there is at least one human who is asleep, and no humans will run, it is not the case that Hazel will run (from statement 5).\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Alfred isn't asleep but it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey. - This statement is false because we know that Hazel is a monkey.\n\n2. Alfred and Hazel will run. - This statement is false because we know that Alfred won't run.\n\n3. Alfred won't run. - This statement is true.\n\n4. Alfred isn't asleep and Hazel is a monkey. - This statement is false because we know that Alfred isn't asleep.\n\n5. Alfred will run. - This statement is false because we know that Alfred won't run.\n\n6. Hazel will run. - This statement is false because we know that Hazel won't run.\n\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n3. Alfred won't run.",

If everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each, then we can conclude that there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. Alfred and Hazel are happy. This information alone doesn't tell us anything about the other characters, but it's a starting point.\n\n3. Hazel doesn't see Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred. This implies that there is a monkey that kicked Alfred, and Hazel is not the one who kicked Alfred. Since there is at least one monkey, and we know that a monkey kicked Alfred, we can conclude that there is at least one monkey.\n\n4. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel. This statement is conditional, and we need to consider the case where Lewis is a donkey. If Lewis is a donkey, then we can conclude that every monkey is hungry. However, we don't know if every monkey saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. Alfred isn't happy. This statement is not necessarily true. We only know that Alfred and Hazel are happy, and we don't have any information about the happiness of the other characters.\n\n6. Alfred and Lewis are happy. This statement is not necessarily true. We know that Alfred is happy, but we don't have any information about Lewis's happiness.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements again with the new information that Lewis is a donkey.\n\nSince Lewis is a donkey, we can conclude that every monkey is hungry (from statement 4). We also know that there is at least one monkey, and we know that a monkey kicked Alfred. Since every monkey is hungry, and there is at least one monkey, we can conclude that there is at least one monkey who saw Hazel.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the statements:\n\n1. Lewis is happy. This statement is not necessarily true. We know that Lewis is a donkey, but we don't have any information about his happiness.\n\n2. Alfred is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel. This statement is true. We know that Alfred is happy, and we know that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n\n3. Alfred is happy but it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel. This statement is true. We know that Alfred is happy, and we know that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n\n4. Lewis and Alfred are happy. This statement is not necessarily true. We know that Lewis is a donkey, but we don't have any information about his happiness.\n\n5. Alfred isn't happy. This statement is not necessarily true. We know that Alfred is happy.\n\n6. Alfred and Lewis are happy. This statement is not necessarily true. We know that Alfred is happy, but we don't have any information about Lewis's happiness.\n\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n\n* 2. Alfred is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n* 3. Alfred is happy but it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.",

There's at least one of each - This means there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n3. Hazel kicked every monkey - Since there is at least one monkey, and Hazel kicked every monkey, it means Hazel must be a monkey.\n\n4. If Alfred is asleep, then Hazel will attack - This statement is conditional, and we don't know if Alfred is asleep or not. So, we can't conclude anything from this statement.\n\n5.

Alfred won't attack - We don't have any information about Alfred's behavior, so we can't conclude this.\n\n2. Alfred and Hazel will attack - We don't know if Alfred is asleep or not, and we don't know if Hazel will attack if Alfred is asleep. So, we can't conclude this.\n\n3. Hazel didn't kick Hazel - This is a contradiction, as we know Hazel kicked every monkey, and Hazel is a monkey.\n\n4. Hazel kicked Hazel - This is a contradiction, as Hazel can't kick herself.\n\n5. Alfred and Lewis will attack - We don't know if Alfred is asleep or not, and we don't know if Lewis will attack. So, we can't conclude this.\n\n6. Alfred will attack - We don't have any information about Alfred's behavior, so we can't conclude this.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n\n- There is no statement that must be true, but we can conclude that statement 3 and 4 are false.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively) - This means that there are only three types of entities: donkeys, humans, and monkeys.\n\n2. Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every monkey. - This statement implies that if a donkey chases a monkey, then that monkey chases every other monkey. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between donkeys and monkeys.\n\n3. A human is happy and Lewis is happy. - This statement tells us that there is at least one human and Lewis is happy.\n\n4. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel didn't chase Alfred. - This statement tells us that not all donkeys saw Hazel, and Hazel did not chase Alfred.\n\n5. No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis is happy. - This statement tells us that no donkey saw Lewis, and Lewis is happy.\n\n6. A monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey saw Lewis. - This statement implies that if a monkey chases Hazel, then every monkey saw Lewis.\n\nFrom the given statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Lewis is happy (statement 3) and no donkey saw Lewis (statement 5), Lewis cannot be a donkey (because if he were a donkey, then a donkey would have seen him, which contradicts statement 5).\n\n- Since Lewis is happy (statement 3) and no donkey saw Lewis (statement 5), and every donkey chases every donkey that chases every monkey (statement 2), it is possible that Lewis is a monkey. If Lewis were a monkey, then every monkey saw Lewis (statement 6), which is consistent with the given statements.\n\n- Since every donkey chases every donkey that chases every monkey (statement 2) and no donkey saw Lewis (statement 5), it is possible that there is a donkey that chases every other donkey, but this donkey did not see Lewis.\n\n- Since every donkey chases every donkey that chases every monkey (statement 2) and no donkey saw Lewis (statement 5), it is possible that there is a donkey that chases every other donkey, but this donkey did not see Lewis.\n\n- Since every donkey chases every donkey that chases every monkey (statement 2) and no donkey saw Lewis (statement 5), it is possible that there is a donkey that chases every other donkey, but this donkey did not see Lewis.\n\n- Since every donkey chases every donkey that chases every monkey (statement 2) and no donkey saw Lewis (statement 5), it is possible that there is a donkey that chases every other donkey, but this donkey did not see Lewis.\n\n- Since a monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey saw Lewis (statement 6) and there is at least one monkey (statement 3), it is possible that there is a monkey that chases Hazel, but this monkey did not see Lewis.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that the following statements must be true:\n\n- 2.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively) - This means that there are no other types of animals in the situation.\n\n2. Not all humans are hungry - This means that there is at least one human who is not hungry.\n\n3. No donkeys kicked Hazel - This means that all donkeys did not kick Hazel.\n\n4. Hazel will attack only if a donkey kicked Hazel - This means that if a donkey kicked Hazel, then Hazel will attack.\n\n5. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel - This means that if Hazel is hungry, then either not all donkeys kicked Alfred or no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. Alfred will attack - There is no information that suggests that Alfred will attack. In fact, we don't have any information about Alfred's behavior.\n\n2. Alfred won't attack - This statement is also not supported by the given information.\n\n3. Hazel won't attack - This statement is not necessarily true. If a donkey kicked Hazel, then Hazel will attack (from statement 4). We don't have any information that prevents a donkey from kicking Hazel.\n\n4. Alfred and Hazel will attack - This statement is not supported by the given information. We don't have any information that suggests that both Alfred and Hazel will attack.\n\n5. Hazel will attack - This statement is not necessarily true. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred (from statement 5). However, we don't have any information that suggests that Hazel is hungry.\n\nHowever, we can find a connection between statements 3 and 5. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred (from statement 5). But we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel (from statement 3). This means that if Hazel is hungry, then all donkeys kicked Alfred. Since all donkeys kicked Alfred, and all donkeys kicked Hazel, we can conclude that Hazel is not hungry.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate statement 5. If Hazel is not hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred (from statement 5). But we know that all donkeys kicked Alfred (from statement 3). This means that not all donkeys kicked Alfred is false, and therefore, Hazel is hungry.\n\nSince Hazel is hungry, we can conclude that Hazel will attack (from statement 4). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n5. Hazel will attack.",

Every human saw Hazel - This is not necessarily true. We know that every human was seen by Hazel, but we don't know if every human saw Hazel. There could be a human who didn't see Hazel.\n\n2. No humans saw Hazel - This is not necessarily true. We know that every human was seen by Hazel, so it's possible that some humans saw Hazel.\n\n3. Not all humans saw Hazel - This is true. We know that every human was seen by Hazel, but we don't know if every human saw Hazel. There could be a human who didn't see Hazel.\n\n4. Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel - This is true. If Hazel is not a human, then it's possible that no human saw Hazel. But if Hazel is a human, then every human saw Hazel.\n\n5. A human saw Hazel - This is not necessarily true. We know that every human was seen by Hazel, but we don't know if every human saw Hazel. There could be a human who didn't see Hazel.\n\n6. Hazel saw a human - This is not necessarily true. We know that every human was seen by Hazel, but we don't know if Hazel saw a human. There could be a human who didn't see Hazel.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n3. Not all humans saw Hazel.",

Since Lewis is not a donkey, the human who will run must be a human. If every human saw Hazel, then Alfred did not see Lewis (by statement 5).

This human must be a human who will run, and this human is Lewis. Therefore, Lewis saw Hazel.\n\n2. Hazel saw Hazel and Lewis saw Alfred.\n\n- This statement is false. We know that Hazel doesn't see Hazel (statement 3), so this statement is false.\n\n3. Hazel saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n\n- This statement is false. We know that Lewis saw Alfred (statement 4), so this statement is false.\n\n4. Lewis saw Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n- This statement is false. We know that Lewis saw Alfred (statement 4), but we also know that Lewis saw Hazel (from statement 1). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5.

If there are multiple donkeys, it is possible that some donkeys saw other donkeys that saw them.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements in the context of the given situation.\n\n- If Alfred is a human, then statement 1 is false, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Alfred must be a donkey.\n\n- If Alfred is a donkey, then every donkey saw every other donkey (statement 4) and every donkey saw every other donkey (statement 3) must be true.

Since there is at least one donkey, if not all donkeys kicked Hazel, then there must be a donkey that did not kick Hazel. This implies that there is a donkey that did not kick Hazel. Since only humans are hungry, if there is a donkey that did not kick Hazel, then there must be a human who did not kick Hazel. Therefore, not all humans kicked Hazel, which implies that no humans are hungry.\n\n2. Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n\n- This statement is not necessarily true. We do not have any information that links Alfred and Lewis's hunger. We only know that only humans are hungry, but we do not know if either of them is a human.\n\n3. If Hazel kicked Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n\n- This statement is true. If Hazel kicked Hazel, then it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Hazel.

Alfred will run. - We do not have any information about Alfred's running, so we cannot conclude this statement.\n\n2. No donkeys are happy. - This statement is false, since we know that either every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run. If not all donkeys will run, then there must be at least one happy donkey.\n\n3. Every donkey is happy. - This statement is false, since we know that either every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run. If not all donkeys will run, then there must be at least one unhappy donkey.\n\n4. Not all donkeys are happy. - This statement is true, since we know that either every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run. If not all donkeys will run, then there must be at least one unhappy donkey.\n\n5. Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run. - This statement is a contradiction, since we know that either every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run. If not all donkeys will run, then there must be at least one donkey that does not run.\n\n6. Only donkeys are happy. - This statement is false, since we know that either every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run. If not all donkeys will run, then there must be at least one non-donkey that is happy.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n4. Not all donkeys are happy.",

Every monkey saw Alfred - This means that all monkeys saw Alfred.\n\n5. If Lewis is hungry, then every monkey is hungry - This means that if Lewis is hungry, then all monkeys are hungry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. Not all humans are hungry and every monkey saw Alfred - This statement is true. We know that there is at least one human who is not hungry (from statement 2) and all monkeys saw Alfred (from statement 4).\n\n2. Alfred is hungry - This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have any information about Alfred's hunger.\n\n3. Alfred isn't hungry - This statement is also not necessarily true. We don't have any information about Alfred's hunger.\n\n4. Alfred and Lewis are hungry - This statement is not necessarily true. We know that if Lewis is hungry, then all monkeys are hungry (from statement 5), but we don't have any information about Lewis's hunger.\n\n5. No monkeys saw Alfred just in case no humans are hungry - This statement is true. If no humans are hungry, then no monkeys can see Alfred (since all monkeys saw Alfred, from statement 4). If no monkeys saw Alfred, then no humans can be hungry (since all humans are either donkeys or monkeys, and we know that all monkeys saw Alfred).\n\n6. If every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred - This statement is not necessarily true. We know that if all monkeys are hungry, then no humans are hungry (from statement 5), but we don't have any information about Alfred's hunger.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1. Not all humans are hungry and every monkey saw Alfred.",

Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it - This means that for every monkey, there is another monkey that saw it.\n\n4. A monkey chased Alfred and a human will run - This means that there is at least one monkey that chased Alfred, and there is at least one human that will run.\n\n5. Every monkey saw Alfred - This means that all monkeys saw Alfred.\n\n6. No donkeys saw Hazel - This means that there are no donkeys that saw Hazel.\n\nFrom the given statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since every monkey saw a monkey that saw it (statement 3), and every monkey saw Alfred (statement 5), it means that every monkey saw Alfred. This implies that Alfred is visible to all monkeys.\n\n- Since a monkey chased Alfred (statement 4) and every monkey saw Alfred (statement 5), it means that Alfred was chased by at least one monkey.\n\n- Since a human will run (statement 4) and there is at least one human (statement 2), it means that there is at least one human that will run.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. Alfred will run - There is no direct information about Alfred running, so we cannot conclude this.\n\n2. A monkey saw Alfred - Since every monkey saw Alfred (statement 5), this statement must be true.\n\n3. Not all monkeys saw Alfred - This is not necessarily true. Since every monkey saw a monkey that saw it (statement 3) and every monkey saw Alfred (statement 5), it means that all monkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. Alfred saw every monkey - This is not necessarily true. Since every monkey saw a monkey that saw it (statement 3) and every monkey saw Alfred (statement 5), it means that every monkey was seen by a monkey that saw Alfred. However, it does not mean that Alfred saw every monkey.\n\n5. Alfred saw a monkey - This is not necessarily true. Since every monkey saw Alfred (statement 5) and there is at least one monkey that chased Alfred (statement 4), it means that there is at least one monkey that did not see Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. No monkeys saw Alfred - This is not necessarily true.

If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel. \n   - This statement implies that if Lewis is a donkey, then there are no monkeys who kicked Hazel.\n\n4. Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep. \n   - This statement implies that there are donkeys who did not chase Alfred, and Alfred is not asleep.\n\n5. Not all donkeys chased Alfred and only donkeys are asleep. \n   - This statement implies that there are donkeys who did not chase Alfred, and all the animals that are asleep are donkeys.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. Alfred and Hazel will run. \n   - There is no direct information that supports this statement. We can't conclude that Alfred and Hazel will run.\n\n2. Alfred and Lewis will run. \n   - There is no direct information that supports this statement. We can't conclude that Alfred and Lewis will run.\n\n3. Alfred is a donkey. \n   - This statement is not supported by the given information. We can't conclude that Alfred is a donkey.\n\n4. Alfred won't run. \n   - This statement is not supported by the given information. We can't conclude that Alfred won't run.\n\n5. Alfred will run. \n   - This statement is not supported by the given information. We can't conclude that Alfred will run.\n\n6. Alfred isn't a donkey. \n   - This statement is not supported by the given information. We can't conclude that Alfred isn't a donkey.\n\nHowever, from the given information, we can conclude that there are donkeys who did not chase Alfred (statement 4) and all the animals that are asleep are donkeys (statement 5). Since there are donkeys who did not chase Alfred, and all the animals that are asleep are donkeys, it is possible that Alfred is a donkey (statement 3) and is asleep. \n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n3. Alfred is a donkey.",

If a donkey is happy, it is possible that a donkey kicked Alfred.\n\n2. A donkey kicked Alfred. - This statement cannot be true because if a donkey kicked Alfred, then the statement \"Every donkey is happy\" would be false, which contradicts the statement \"A donkey is happy\".\n\n3. Alfred is happy. - This statement cannot be determined as true or false because we do not have any information about Alfred's happiness.\n\n4. Alfred kicked every donkey. - This statement cannot be true because if Alfred is a donkey, then he cannot kick every donkey, as there are other donkeys besides himself.\n\n5. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred. - This statement must be true. If a monkey kicked Alfred, then the statement \"Every donkey is happy\" would be false, which would make the statement \"A donkey is happy\" false. However, we know that \"A donkey is happy\" is true. Therefore, there cannot be a monkey that kicked Alfred. If there were no monkeys, then every donkey would be happy, and the statement \"A donkey is happy\" would be true. But we know that Alfred is a donkey, and we do not know if he is happy. Therefore, not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n6. Every donkey kicked Alfred. - This statement cannot be true because we do not have any information that all donkeys kicked Alfred.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively) - This means that there are only three types of entities: donkeys, humans, and monkeys.\n\n2. There's at least one of each - This means there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n3. A human kicked every monkey - This means that every monkey was kicked by a human.\n\n4. Every monkey kicked a monkey - This means that each monkey was kicked by another monkey.\n\n5. Hazel is a monkey - This is a specific fact about Hazel.\n\n6. No humans will run - This is a fact about humans.\n\nFrom the given facts, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since every monkey was kicked by a human (statement 3) and every monkey kicked a monkey (statement 4), it means that the kickers of the monkeys are the same. This implies that there is at least one human who kicked every monkey.\n\n- Since Hazel is a monkey (statement 5) and no humans will run (statement 6), the human who kicked every monkey must be a monkey. \n\n- Since there is at least one human (statement 2) and no humans will run (statement 6), there must be at least one human who is not running.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. A human will run. - This is not necessarily true. There is at least one human who is not running.\n\n2. Only humans will run and no humans will run. - This is a contradiction, as it states that humans will run and will not run at the same time.\n\n3. Only humans will run and not all humans will run. - This is true. There is at least one human who is not running, and all humans are running.\n\n4. Not all humans will run. - This is true, as we have already established that there is at least one human who is not running.\n\n5. Only humans will run. - This is not necessarily true. We have established that there is at least one monkey who is a kicker, and we don't know if the kickers are all humans.\n\n6. Every human will run. - This is not necessarily true.

Every monkey chased a donkey. - This means that every monkey is chasing a donkey.\n\n3.  A monkey saw a human that saw a human. - This means that there is a human who saw another human, and that human was seen by a monkey.\n\n4.  If Alfred ate, then a human chased Hazel. - This statement does not provide any direct information about the relationships between the other animals, so we cannot determine its truth value based on the given information.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1.  A monkey chased a donkey. - This statement is not necessarily true. We know that every monkey chased a donkey, but we do not know if there are any monkeys that chased a donkey other than the ones that chased a human.\n\n2.  A donkey chased a monkey. - This statement is not necessarily true. We know that every monkey chased a donkey, but we do not know if there are any donkeys that chased a monkey.\n\n3.  A donkey chased every monkey. - This statement is not necessarily true. We know that every monkey chased a donkey, but we do not know if there are any donkeys that chased every monkey.\n\n4.  Every donkey chased a monkey. - This statement is not necessarily true. We know that every monkey chased a donkey, but we do not know if there are any donkeys that chased a monkey.\n\n5.

No donkeys chased every monkey. - This statement is true. If every monkey chased a donkey, and there are no other types of animals, then every monkey must have chased a donkey.

A donkey is happy. - This information is not directly relevant to the other statements, but it does tell us that at least one donkey exists.\n\n3. Every human is happy. - This information is also not directly relevant to the other statements, but it tells us that at least one human exists.\n\n4.

Hazel saw a donkey. - This statement cannot be true because we know that no donkeys saw Hazel (statement 4).\n\n6. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel saw Hazel. - This statement is a conjunction of two statements. The first part, \"not all donkeys saw Hazel,\" must be true (as we have already established). The second part, \"Hazel saw Hazel,\" is a tautology, as it is a statement about the same thing (Hazel) seeing itself.
