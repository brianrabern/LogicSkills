This can be written as: \u00acAA \u2192 (\u00acADKH \u2192 \u00acMKH).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 1: Alfred won't attack.**\n\n*   We have no direct information about Alfred's attacking behavior. The conditionals relate attacking to other actions, but we don't have a trigger for them.\n*   We cannot deduce this from the given information.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n\n*   \"Alfred is happy\" is directly stated in point 3.\n*   \"A monkey kicked Alfred\" is directly stated in point 5.\n*   Since both parts are explicitly given as true, their conjunction must also be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Alfred will attack.**\n\n*   Similar to statement 1, we have no direct information about Alfred's attacking behavior.\n*   We cannot deduce this from the given information.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis will attack.**\n\n*   We don't know if Alfred will attack (as per analysis of 1 and 3).\n*   We don't know if Lewis will attack. Lewis is unhappy, but unhappiness doesn't necessarily imply attacking.\n*   We cannot deduce this.\n\n**Statement 5: A monkey is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n\n*   \"A monkey kicked Alfred\" is true (point 5).\n*   \"A monkey is happy\": We know Alfred is happy, and a monkey kicked Alfred. However, we don't know if the *same* monkey that kicked Alfred is happy, or if *any* monkey is happy. Alfred is happy, but Alfred could be a human or a donkey. If Alfred is a monkey, then \"a monkey is happy\" would be true. But we don't know Alfred's species.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say \"a monkey is happy\" is true.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel will attack.**\n\n*   We don't know if Alfred will attack.\n*   We have no information about Hazel's attacking behavior.\n*   We cannot deduce this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information provided, only statement 2 is unequivocally true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem statement by statement and use logical deduction.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n    *   This means the set of all entities is partitioned into three non-overlapping groups: Donkeys (D), Humans (H), Monkeys (M).\n    *   $D \\cap H = \\emptyset$, $D \\cap M = \\emptyset$, $H \\cap M = \\emptyset$.\n    *   $D \\cup H \\cup M = \\text{All Entities}$.\n    *   $|D| \\ge 1$, $|H| \\ge 1$, $|M| \\ge 1$.\n\n2.  **No donkeys saw Lewis.**\n    *   For any $x \\in D$, $x$ did not see Lewis.\n\n3.  **Every human saw Alfred.**\n    *   For any $x \\in H$, $x$ saw Alfred.\n\n4.  **No humans are asleep only if every monkey saw Lewis.**\n    *   Let $A_H$ be the proposition \"No humans are asleep\".\n    *   Let $S_M$ be the proposition \"Every monkey saw Lewis\".\n    *   The statement is $A_H \\implies S_M$. (If no humans are asleep, then every monkey saw Lewis).\n\n5.  **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n    *   Let $H_L$ be the proposition \"A human saw Lewis\".\n    *   Let $N_HCH$ be the proposition \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\".\n    *   The statement is $H_L \\land \\neg N_HCH$.\n    *   $\\neg N_HCH$ means \"It is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel\", which simplifies to \"Hazel chased Hazel\". This part seems to be a distractor as it doesn't directly relate to the other logical conditions about seeing/sleeping. The crucial part is \"A human saw Lewis\".\n\n**Deductions:**\n\nFrom (5), we know:\n*   **A human saw Lewis.** (Let's call this Human X).\n\nNow, let's use this with (3):\n*   From (3): **Every human saw Alfred.**\n*   Since Human X is a human, and every human saw Alfred, then **Human X saw Alfred.**\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1.  **A human saw Alfred.**\n    *   From (3), \"Every human saw Alfred\". Since there is at least one human (from 1), it follows that *a* human saw Alfred. This statement **must be true**.\n\n2.  **Alfred is asleep.**\n    *   There is no information given about Alfred's state of being asleep. This statement **cannot be determined** as true or false.\n\n3.  **No humans saw Alfred.**\n    *   From (3), \"Every human saw Alfred\". This directly contradicts \"No humans saw Alfred\". This statement **must be false**.\n\n4.  **Alfred saw every human.**\n    *   We know \"Every human saw Alfred\" (humans are the subject, Alfred is the object). This does not imply \"Alfred saw every human\" (Alfred is the subject, humans are the object). For example, I see a tree, but the tree doesn't see me. This statement **cannot be determined** as true or false.\n\n5.  **Alfred saw a human.**\n    *   Similar to (4), \"Every human saw Alfred\" does not imply \"Alfred saw a human\". This statement **cannot be determined** as true or false.\n\n6.  **Not all humans saw Alfred.**\n    *   From (3), \"Every human saw Alfred\". This means \"All humans saw Alfred\". Therefore, \"Not all humans saw Alfred\" is false. This statement **must be false**.\n\n**Revisiting the \"No humans are asleep only if every monkey saw Lewis\" clause (4):**\n\n*   We know \"A human saw Lewis\" from (5).\n*   Does this tell us anything about \"Every monkey saw Lewis\"? Not directly.\n*   Does this tell us anything about \"No humans are asleep\"? Not directly.\n*   If \"No humans are asleep\" were true, then \"Every monkey saw Lewis\" would be true.\n*   If \"Every monkey saw Lewis\" were false, then \"No humans are asleep\" would be false (meaning \"At least one human is asleep\").\n*   However, we don't have enough information to determine the truth value of \"No humans are asleep\" or \"Every monkey saw Lewis\". This clause seems to be a distractor for the given options, as the options primarily revolve around humans and Alfred.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information is \"A human saw Alfred.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

(This means at least one donkey did not eat).\n5.  **Conditional 1:** If (not all donkeys will run) THEN (Hazel kicked Alfred ONLY IF no monkeys kicked Hazel).\n6.  **Running:** Only humans will run. (This is a crucial statement. It means:\n    *   If something runs, it is a human.\n    *   If something is a human, it *will* run. (This is implied by \"Only humans will run\" in the context of a general statement about who runs. If a human *didn't* run, then it wouldn't be \"only humans\" running, as there would be a human not running, and presumably other things not running either. The most natural interpretation is that all humans will run, and nothing else will.)\n7.  **Kicking:** A monkey kicked Alfred.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n*   **From (7) \"A monkey kicked Alfred\" and (1) \"exclusively\":** Alfred is not a monkey.\n*   **From (6) \"Only humans will run\":**\n    *   If something runs, it's a human.\n    *   If something is a human, it will run.\n    *   Donkeys will not run.\n    *   Monkeys will not run.\n\n*   **Consider \"not all donkeys will run\":** From our deduction from (6), we know that \"Donkeys will not run.\" This means *no* donkeys will run. If no donkeys will run, then it is certainly true that \"not all donkeys will run.\"\n    *   Therefore, the premise of Conditional 1 (\"not all donkeys will run\") is **TRUE**.\n\n*   **Since the premise of Conditional 1 is TRUE, its consequent must also be TRUE:**\n    *   (Hazel kicked Alfred ONLY IF no monkeys kicked Hazel) must be TRUE.\n    *   This means: If Hazel kicked Alfred, then no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n*   **Let's determine Alfred's category:**\n    *   We know Alfred drank (from 3).\n    *   We know a monkey kicked Alfred (from 7).\n    *   From (6), \"Only humans will run.\" This means donkeys won't run and monkeys won't run.\n    *   If Alfred were a donkey, Alfred wouldn't run.\n    *   If Alfred were a monkey, Alfred wouldn't run.\n    *   If Alfred were a human, Alfred *would* run (because all humans will run, from 6).\n\n*   **Can Alfred be a donkey?**\n    *   If Alfred is a donkey, then Alfred won't run.\n    *   This doesn't contradict anything directly yet.\n\n*   **Can Alfred be a monkey?**\n    *   No, because \"A monkey kicked Alfred\" (7) and categories are exclusive (1). If Alfred is a monkey, then a monkey kicked itself, which is highly unlikely and usually not implied in such problems unless explicitly stated. More importantly, it violates the exclusivity if Alfred is the monkey that kicked Alfred. So, Alfred is not a monkey.\n\n*   **Can Alfred be a human?**\n    *   If Alfred is a human, then Alfred will run (from 6).\n\n*   **Let's re-evaluate \"Only humans will run\" (6):**\n    *   This implies that if you are a human, you will run.\n    *   This implies that if you are *not* a human (i.e., a donkey or a monkey), you will *not* run.\n    *   Since we established \"not all donkeys will run\" is TRUE (because *no* donkeys will run), the consequent \"Hazel kicked Alfred ONLY IF no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is TRUE.\n\n*   **What about Alfred's running status?**\n    *   We know \"A monkey kicked Alfred\" (7).\n    *   We know \"Only humans will run\" (6).\n    *   This means that if Alfred runs, Alfred must be a human.\n    *   This also means that if Alfred is a donkey or a monkey, Alfred will not run.\n    *   We already deduced Alfred is not a monkey. So Alfred is either a human or a donkey.\n\n*   **Let's consider the options given:**\n\n    *   **1. Alfred drank and not all humans will run.**\n        *   Alfred drank is TRUE (from 3).\n        *   \"Not all humans will run\": From (6) \"Only humans will run,\" it implies *all* humans will run. If only humans run, and there are humans, then all of them must run. So, \"not all humans will run\" is FALSE.\n        *   Therefore, statement 1 is FALSE.\n\n    *   **2. Alfred drank and only humans will run.**\n        *   Alfred drank is TRUE (from 3).\n        *   \"Only humans will run\" is TRUE (from 6).\n        *   Therefore, statement 2 is TRUE.\n\n    *   **3. Alfred drank and no humans will run.**\n        *   Alfred drank is TRUE (from 3).\n        *   \"No humans will run\": From (6) \"Only humans will run,\" and the fact that there's at least one human (2), it implies that humans *will* run. So, \"no humans will run\" is FALSE.\n        *   Therefore, statement 3 is FALSE.\n\n    *   **4. Alfred won't run.**\n        *   We know Alfred is either a human or a donkey.\n        *   If Alfred is a human, Alfred will run.\n        *   If Alfred is a donkey, Alfred won't run.\n        *   We don't have enough information to definitively say whether Alfred is a human or a donkey. The fact that a monkey kicked Alfred doesn't tell us Alfred's species.\n        *   Therefore, statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n    *   **5. Alfred will run.**\n        *   As explained for statement 4, we don't know if Alfred is a human or a donkey.\n        *   Therefore, statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n\n    *   **6. Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n        *   We don't know if Alfred will run.\n        *   We don't know Hazel's category. If Hazel is a human, Hazel will run. If Hazel is a donkey or monkey, Hazel won't run.\n        *   Therefore, statement 6 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe key deductions are:\n1.  \"Only humans will run\" means all humans run, and nothing else runs.\n2.  \"Not all donkeys will run\" is true because no donkeys will run.\n3.  Therefore, \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is true.\n4.  Alfred drank is explicitly stated.\n\nStatement 2 combines two explicitly stated or directly derived truths: \"Alfred drank\" (given) and \"only humans will run\" (given).\n\nThe other statements contain components that are either false based on the given information (e.g., \"not all humans will run\" or \"no humans will run\") or cannot be definitively determined (e.g., Alfred's running status or Hazel's running status).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(This is a red herring for the statements about Alfred and donkeys, as it doesn't connect to them directly).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nThe core of the problem revolves around Alfred, his identity as a donkey, and the action of \"chasing Alfred\" or \"chasing donkeys.\" The crucial piece of information is \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\"\n\nLet's denote \"chased\" as 'C'.\nSo, A didn't C A.\n\n**Statement 1: Alfred chased every donkey.**\n*   This means A C X for all X \u2208 D.\n*   Since Alfred is a donkey (A \u2208 D), this would imply A C A.\n*   However, we are given that Alfred didn't chase Alfred (A didn't C A).\n*   Therefore, this statement **cannot be true**.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred chased a donkey.**\n*   This means there exists some X \u2208 D such that A C X.\n*   We know A didn't C A.\n*   Could Alfred have chased another donkey (if there is one)? Yes. Could Alfred have chased no donkeys at all? Yes.\n*   We have no information to confirm or deny this. It **does not have to be true**.\n\n**Statement 3: No donkeys chased Alfred.**\n*   This means for all X \u2208 D, X didn't C A.\n*   Since Alfred is a donkey (A \u2208 D), this would imply A didn't C A.\n*   We are given that Alfred didn't chase Alfred. This part is consistent.\n*   However, could another donkey (if there is one) have chased Alfred? Yes. Could no other donkey have chased Alfred? Yes.\n*   We have no information to confirm or deny this for *all* donkeys. It **does not have to be true**.\n\n**Statement 4: A donkey chased Alfred.**\n*   This means there exists some X \u2208 D such that X C A.\n*   We know A didn't C A. So, if this statement were true, it would have to be a *different* donkey than Alfred, or it would contradict the given information.\n*   Could another donkey (if there is one) have chased Alfred? Yes. Could no donkey have chased Alfred? Yes.\n*   We have no information to confirm or deny this. It **does not have to be true**.\n\n**Statement 5: Every donkey chased Alfred.**\n*   This means for all X \u2208 D, X C A.\n*   Since Alfred is a donkey (A \u2208 D), this would imply A C A.\n*   However, we are given that Alfred didn't chase Alfred (A didn't C A).\n*   Therefore, this statement **cannot be true**.\n\n**Statement 6: Not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n*   This is the negation of \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\"\n*   \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" means (for all X \u2208 D, X C A).\n*   Its negation is \"It is not the case that (for all X \u2208 D, X C A)\", which is equivalent to \"There exists at least one donkey X such that X didn't C A.\"\n*   We know that Alfred is a donkey (A \u2208 D).\n*   We are given that Alfred didn't chase Alfred (A didn't C A).\n*   Therefore, Alfred himself is a donkey who didn't chase Alfred. This satisfies the condition \"There exists at least one donkey X such that X didn't C A.\"\n*   Thus, this statement **must be true**.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

Since Hazel didn't chase herself, if this statement were true, it would mean *another* monkey chased Hazel. We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n\n**Option 3: Hazel chased every monkey.**\n*   We know Hazel is a monkey (8).\n*   We know Hazel didn't chase Hazel (3).\n*   If Hazel chased every monkey, and Hazel is a monkey, then Hazel would have to chase herself.

Since we already know Hazel didn't chase Hazel, this statement is equivalent to saying \"no other monkey chased Hazel.\" We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n\n**Option 5: Not all monkeys chased Hazel.**\n*   Let's consider the opposite: \"Every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n*   If \"Every monkey chased Hazel\" were true, then since Hazel is a monkey (8), Hazel would have to chase herself.\n*   However, we are explicitly told \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" (3).\n*   Therefore, the statement \"Every monkey chased Hazel\" must be false.\n*   If \"Every monkey chased Hazel\" is false, then its negation, \"Not all monkeys chased Hazel,\" must be true.\n\n**Option 6: Every monkey chased Hazel.**\n*   As shown in the analysis for Option 5, if this were true, Hazel (being a monkey) would have chased herself.\n*   But we know Hazel didn't chase Hazel (3).\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 5, \"Not all monkeys chased Hazel,\" must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(This means if X is a monkey and Y is a donkey, X did not see Y).\n4.  **Donkey-Hazel Sightings:**\n    *   Not all donkeys saw Hazel. (This means there's at at least one donkey that did *not* see Hazel).\n    *   No donkeys saw Hazel. (This means for every donkey X, X did not see Hazel).\n    *   **Contradiction:** These two statements about donkeys and Hazel are contradictory. \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" allows for some donkeys to have seen Hazel, while \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" means *zero* donkeys saw Hazel. If \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" is true, then it automatically implies \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (because zero is certainly not \"all\"). Therefore, the stronger statement \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" is the one we should use, as it encompasses the other.\n5.  **Alfred's Eating & Monkey/Donkey Chasing:** If Alfred ate (A_e), then (every monkey chased Hazel (M_chase_H) only if no donkeys ate (D_not_eat)).\n    *   Symbolically: A_e -> (M_chase_H -> D_not_eat)\n\n**Analysis of Key Information:**\n\n*   **No monkeys saw a donkey:** This is crucial. It means there's no \"saw\" relationship from a monkey to a donkey.\n*   **No donkeys saw Hazel:** This means no donkey has the property of \"saw Hazel\".\n\n**Let's evaluate each statement:**\n\n**1. No monkeys saw every donkey.**\n    *   We know \"No monkeys saw *a* donkey.\" This is a stronger statement. If no monkey saw *any* donkey, then it's impossible for a monkey to have seen *every* donkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**2. A donkey saw a monkey.**\n    *   We know \"No monkeys saw a donkey.\" This tells us about the direction of seeing (monkey -> donkey). It says nothing about the direction (donkey -> monkey).\n    *   It's entirely possible that a donkey saw a monkey, or that no donkey saw any monkey. The given information does not force this to be true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. A donkey saw every monkey.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, the given information doesn't restrict donkeys from seeing monkeys. It's possible, but not necessary.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. No donkeys saw every monkey.**\n    *   Again, the given information doesn't restrict donkeys from seeing monkeys. It's possible that one donkey saw all monkeys, or that no donkey saw all monkeys. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. Every donkey saw a monkey.**\n    *   This implies that for every donkey, there exists at least one monkey that it saw.\n    *   The given information does not provide any constraints that would force donkeys to see monkeys.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. Every donkey saw every monkey.**\n    *   This implies that for every donkey, and for every monkey, that donkey saw that monkey.\n    *   The given information does not provide any constraints that would force donkeys to see monkeys.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Revisiting the Contradiction:**\n\nThe problem states:\n*   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\"\n*   \"and no donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n\nThese two statements are indeed contradictory if interpreted strictly as independent facts.\n*   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" means $\\exists D_i \\text{ such that } D_i \\text{ did not see Hazel}$. This allows for some donkeys to have seen Hazel.\n*   \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" means $\\forall D_i, D_i \\text{ did not see Hazel}$. This means *zero* donkeys saw Hazel.\n\nIf \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" is true, then it logically implies \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (because if none saw Hazel, then it's certainly not the case that *all* saw Hazel).\nHowever, the phrasing \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel *and* no donkeys saw Hazel\" is problematic. It's like saying \"It's raining and it's not raining.\"\n\nLet's assume the intent is that the stronger statement \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" is the operative one, as it makes the \"not all\" redundant but not strictly contradictory if \"not all\" is interpreted as \"it is not the case that all\". If \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" is true, then it is indeed \"not the case that all donkeys saw Hazel\". So, the second part clarifies the first.\n\nLet's proceed with \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" as the definitive fact regarding donkeys and Hazel.\n\n**Impact of Alfred's Eating Clause:**\n\"If Alfred ate, then every monkey chased Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\"\nA_e -> (M_chase_H -> D_not_eat)\n\nThis is a conditional statement. We don't know if Alfred ate, if monkeys chased Hazel, or if donkeys ate. This clause does not provide any direct information about the \"seeing\" relationships between donkeys and monkeys. It's a red herring for the specific statements we need to evaluate.\n\n**Conclusion based on \"No monkeys saw a donkey\":**\n\nThe only statement that directly follows from \"No monkeys saw a donkey\" is statement 1.\n\n*   \"No monkeys saw a donkey\" means: $\\forall M_i, \\forall D_j, \\neg (M_i \\text{ saw } D_j)$.\n*   Statement 1: \"No monkeys saw every donkey.\" This means: $\\forall M_i, \\neg (\\forall D_j, M_i \\text{ saw } D_j)$.\n\nIf it's true that no monkey saw *any* donkey, then it's certainly true that no monkey saw *every* donkey. The first statement is a universal negative, which implies the second.\n\nThe other statements (2-6) are about donkeys seeing monkeys, which is not constrained by \"No monkeys saw a donkey.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

Therefore, **Hazel cannot be hungry.**\n\n**The Contradiction:**\n\nThe statement \"Only humans are hungry and Hazel is a monkey\" creates a contradiction when combined with the previous statement \"Only humans are hungry and Hazel isn't asleep.\"\n\nLet's re-evaluate the phrasing:\n\n*   \"Only humans are hungry\" (Rule A)\n*   \"Hazel isn't asleep\" (Fact B)\n*   \"Only humans are hungry\" (Rule C - repetition of A)\n*   \"Hazel is a monkey\" (Fact D)\n\nThe problem states \"Only humans are hungry and Hazel is a monkey.\" This means *both* \"Only humans are hungry\" *and* \"Hazel is a monkey\" are true.\n\nSo, we have:\n*   **Premise 1:** Only humans are hungry. (Implies: If X is hungry, then X is human. Also implies: If X is not human, then X is not hungry.)\n*   **Premise 2:** Hazel is a monkey.\n*   **Premise 3:** Hazel isn't asleep.\n\nFrom Premise 1 and Premise 2: Since Hazel is a monkey, and only humans are hungry, it *must* be true that **Hazel is not hungry**.\n\nThe problem statement describes a *situation*. If a situation contains contradictory information, then no statements *must* be true within that situation, because the situation itself is impossible.\n\nLet's check for an explicit contradiction.\nWe have:\n1.  Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2.  Only humans are hungry.\n3.  Hazel is a monkey.\n4.  Hazel isn't asleep.\n\nFrom (1) and (3), Hazel is not a human.\nFrom (1) and (2), if someone is not a human, they are not hungry.\nTherefore, Hazel is not hungry. This is consistent.\n\nThe problem does *not* state that Hazel *is* hungry. It states \"Only humans are hungry AND Hazel is a monkey.\" These are two separate facts given as true.\n\nSo, the facts are:\n*   F1: Everything is D or H or M (exclusive, at least one of each).\n*   F2: A human chased Alfred.\n*   F3: Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n*   F4: Lewis did not see Alfred.\n*   F5: Only humans are hungry. (If X is hungry -> X is human. If X is not human -> X is not hungry.)\n*   F6: Hazel isn't asleep.\n*   F7: Hazel is a monkey.\n\nLet's combine F5, F6, and F7:\n*   From F7, Hazel is a monkey.\n*   From F1, monkeys are not humans.\n*   From F5, if someone is not a human, they are not hungry.\n*   Therefore, Hazel is not hungry. This is consistent.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1.  **Not all monkeys are asleep.**\n    *   We know Hazel is a monkey (F7).\n    *   We know Hazel isn't asleep (F6).\n    *   Therefore, there is at least one monkey (Hazel) who is not asleep.\n    *   This means it is not the case that *all* monkeys are asleep.\n    *   **This statement must be true.**\n\n2.  **A monkey is asleep.**\n    *   We only know Hazel (a monkey) is *not* asleep. We have no information about other monkeys. This does not have to be true.\n\n3.  **Every monkey is asleep.**\n    *   This is directly contradicted by Hazel (a monkey) not being asleep. This must be false.\n\n4.  **No monkeys are asleep.**\n    *   We only know Hazel (a monkey) is not asleep. We have no information about other monkeys. This does not have to be true.\n\n5.  **Alfred is asleep.**\n    *   We know a human chased Alfred. We know nothing about Alfred's state of being asleep. This does not have to be true.\n\n6.  **Only monkeys are asleep.**\n    *   This means if someone is asleep, they are a monkey. We have no information to support this. This does not have to be true.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is derived directly from the facts about Hazel.\n\nFinal check: Is there any hidden contradiction?\n\"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\"\n\"Hazel is a monkey.\" (This fulfills the \"at least one monkey\" requirement).\n\"A human chased Alfred.\" (This fulfills the \"at least one human\" requirement).\nWe don't have information about a specific donkey, but the existence of one is stated as a premise of the situation.\n\nThe situation as described is logically consistent.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

If a monkey 'm1' kicked every monkey, and 'm2' is a monkey, then m1 kicked m2. So, it simplifies to: For every donkey 'd', and for every monkey 'm1' such that m1 kicked every monkey, d kicked m1.\n    *   Let's re-read carefully: \"Every donkey kicked every monkey that kicked every monkey.\" This means if there's a monkey, say $M_k$, such that $M_k$ kicked *every* monkey, then *every* donkey kicked $M_k$.\n    *   Let $P_1$ be \"There exists a monkey $M_k$ such that $M_k$ kicked every monkey.\"\n    *   If $P_1$ is true, then for every donkey $D_i$, $D_i$ kicked $M_k$.\n    *   This statement doesn't directly tell us anything about who kicked whom, only a conditional.\n\n2.  \"Every monkey will run or Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\"\n    *   Let R(m) be \"monkey m will run\".\n    *   Let S(A, L) be \"Alfred sees Lewis\".\n    *   $\\forall m \\in M, R(m) \\lor \\neg S(A, L)$\n\n3.  \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless every donkey chased Alfred.\"\n    *   Let K(m, H) be \"monkey m kicked Hazel\".\n    *   Let C(d, A) be \"donkey d chased Alfred\".\n    *   This is an \"A unless B\" statement, which means \"If not B, then A\". So, \"If not (every donkey chased Alfred), then a monkey kicked Hazel.\"\n    *   $\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, C(d, A)) \\implies \\exists m \\in M, K(m, H)$\n\n4.  \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run.\"\n    *   Let SL(m, L) be \"monkey m saw Lewis\".\n    *   Let CH(h, H) be \"human h chased Hazel\".\n    *   Let RL(L) be \"Lewis will run\".\n    *   $(\\forall m \\in M, SL(m, L)) \\implies ((\\exists h \\in H, CH(h, H)) \\implies \\neg RL(L))$\n\n5.  \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\"\n    *   $\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, C(d, A)) \\land (\\exists m \\in M, K(m, A))$\n\n**Analyze the statements:**\n\nFrom statement 5:\n*   $\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, C(d, A))$ is true. This means \"It is NOT the case that every donkey chased Alfred.\" In other words, \"At least one donkey did NOT chase Alfred.\"\n\nNow, look at statement 3:\n*   $\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, C(d, A)) \\implies \\exists m \\in M, K(m, H)$\n*   Since we just established that $\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, C(d, A))$ is true from statement 5, the implication's antecedent is true.\n*   Therefore, the consequent must be true: $\\exists m \\in M, K(m, H)$.\n\nThis means \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" must be true.\n\n**Check the options:**\n\n1.  Every monkey kicked Hazel. (This is stronger than what we found)\n2.  No monkeys kicked Hazel. (This contradicts what we found)\n3.  A monkey kicked Hazel. (This is exactly what we found)\n4.  Hazel kicked a monkey. (We have no information about Hazel kicking monkeys)\n5.  Not all monkeys kicked Hazel. (This is compatible with \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" but not necessarily true. If only one monkey kicked Hazel, this would be true. If all monkeys kicked Hazel, this would be false.)\n6.  Hazel kicked every monkey. (We have no information about Hazel kicking monkeys)\n\nBased on our deduction, only option 3 must be true. The other statements (1, 2, 4, 5, 6) cannot be definitively proven true or false from the given information, except for 2 which is definitively false.\n\nLet's double-check the reasoning.\nStatement 5: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\"\nThis is a conjunction. For a conjunction to be true, both conjuncts must be true.\nSo, \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true.\nThis can be written as $\\neg (\\forall d, C(d, A))$.\n\nStatement 3: \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless every donkey chased Alfred.\"\nThis is equivalent to \"If not (every donkey chased Alfred), then a monkey kicked Hazel.\"\nSymbolically: $\\neg (\\forall d, C(d, A)) \\implies (\\exists m, K(m, H))$.\n\nSince we know $\\neg (\\forall d, C(d, A))$ is true from statement 5, and it's the antecedent of the implication in statement 3, the consequent must be true.\nTherefore, $(\\exists m, K(m, H))$ must be true.\nThis translates to \"A monkey kicked Hazel.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

So, this statement *could* be true or false. We have no information to confirm or deny it.\n\n**Statement 2: Every human kicked every monkey.**\nThis means for every human (h), and for every monkey (m), h kicked m.\nAgain, the rule \"No monkeys kicked a human\" doesn't restrict humans from kicking monkeys. This statement *could* be true or false. We have no information to confirm or deny it.\n\n**Statement 3: Every human kicked a monkey.**\nThis means for every human (h), there exists at least one monkey (m) such that h kicked m.\nSimilar to the above, the given rules do not provide information about humans kicking monkeys. This statement *could* be true or false.\n\n**Statement 4: There is not a human that every monkey kicked.**\nThis can be rephrased as: \"For every human, there is at least one monkey that did not kick that human.\"\nLet's consider the contrapositive: \"There exists a human (h) that every monkey kicked.\"\nThis would mean: \u2203h \u2208 H such that \u2200m \u2208 M, m kicked h.\nHowever, we are given: \"No monkeys kicked a human\" (\u2200m \u2208 M, \u2200h \u2208 H, m did not kick h).\nThis directly contradicts \"m kicked h\".\nTherefore, it is impossible for a human to be kicked by every monkey (or even by *any* monkey).\nSo, the statement \"There is not a human that every monkey kicked\" *must be true*. If no monkey kicked any human, then certainly no human was kicked by *every* monkey.\n\n**Statement 5: A human kicked a monkey.**\nThis means there exists at least one human (h) and at least one monkey (m) such that h kicked m.\nWe have no information to confirm or deny this. It *could* be true or false.\n\n**Statement 6: No humans kicked every monkey.**\nThis means for every human (h), there is at least one monkey (m) that h did not kick.\nThis is the negation of Statement 2 (\"Every human kicked every monkey\").\nWe have no information to confirm or deny Statement 2, so we have no information to confirm or deny its negation. This *could* be true or false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 4 must be true. The rule \"No monkeys kicked a human\" directly implies that no human was kicked by any monkey, let alone by every monkey.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

This means there exists at least one donkey that did not see Hazel.\n3.  **it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred** (Let's call this statement B: $\\neg \\neg \\text{Chased}(\\text{Hazel}, \\text{Alfred})$). This simplifies to **Hazel chased Alfred**.\n4.  **Not all donkeys chased Alfred if and only if Lewis saw Hazel** (Let's call this statement C: $\\neg \\forall x (\\text{Donkey}(x) \\implies \\text{Chased}(x, \\text{Alfred})) \\iff \\text{Saw}(\\text{Lewis}, \\text{Hazel})$).\n5.  **Hazel saw Hazel** (Let's call this statement D: $\\text{Saw}(\\text{Hazel}, \\text{Hazel})$).\n6.  **every monkey chased Alfred** (Let's call this statement E: $\\forall x (\\text{Monkey}(x) \\implies \\text{Chased}(x, \\text{Alfred}))$).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to be Evaluated:**\n\nWe need to determine which of the following statements *must* be true:\n\n*   **1. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is given as true (Statement A).\n    *   \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" means $\\forall x (\\text{Donkey}(x) \\implies \\neg \\text{Saw}(x, \\text{Hazel}))$. This is a stronger statement than \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\". \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" means *at least one* donkey didn't see Hazel. \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" means *all* donkeys didn't see Hazel. These are not necessarily equivalent. If there's one donkey that saw Hazel and one that didn't, then \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true, but \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" is false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **2. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is given as true (Statement A).\n    *   \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is given as true (Statement D).\n    *   Since both conjuncts are explicitly stated as true in the problem description, their conjunction must be true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **3. Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is given as true (Statement A).\n    *   \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" means $\\neg \\text{Saw}(\\text{Hazel}, \\text{Hazel})$.\n    *   However, we are explicitly told that \"Hazel saw Hazel\" (Statement D).\n    *   Therefore, the second part of this conjunction is false, making the entire statement false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\n*   **4. Hazel doesn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" means $\\neg \\text{Saw}(\\text{Hazel}, \\text{Hazel})$. This contradicts Statement D (\"Hazel saw Hazel\"). So, the first part is false.\n    *   \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" is not necessarily true (as discussed in statement 1).\n    *   Since the first part is false, the entire conjunction is false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\n*   **5. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is given as true (Statement A).\n    *   \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" means $\\neg \\text{Saw}(\\text{Hazel}, \\text{Hazel})$. This contradicts Statement D (\"Hazel saw Hazel\"). So, the second part is false.\n    *   Since the second part is false, the entire conjunction is false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\n*   **6. Hazel saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is given as true (Statement D).\n    *   \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" means $\\forall x (\\text{Donkey}(x) \\implies \\neg \\text{Saw}(x, \\text{Hazel}))$. As discussed in statement 1, this is not necessarily true. We only know \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (Statement A), which means *at least one* donkey didn't see Hazel, but it doesn't preclude *some* donkeys from seeing Hazel.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 2 is necessarily true because both of its components are explicitly stated as true in the problem description.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Every monkey chased every donkey: $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, C(m, d)$\n2. No monkeys chased a donkey that chased it: $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, \\neg (C(m, d) \\land C(d, m))$\n3. Every monkey chased every human that chased every monkey: $\\forall m_1 \\in M, \\forall h \\in H, ((\\forall m_2 \\in M, C(h, m_2)) \\implies C(m_1, h))$\n\nLet's analyze these statements.\n\nFrom statement 1: $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, C(m, d)$\nThis means that for any monkey $m$ and any donkey $d$, $m$ chased $d$.\n\nFrom statement 2: $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, \\neg (C(m, d) \\land C(d, m))$\nThis can be rewritten as: $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, (C(m, d) \\implies \\neg C(d, m))$\n\nNow, combine statement 1 and the implication from statement 2.\nSince we know $C(m, d)$ is true for all $m \\in M$ and $d \\in D$ (from statement 1), then it must be that $\\neg C(d, m)$ is true for all $m \\in M$ and $d \\in D$.\n\nSo, $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, \\neg C(d, m)$.\nThis means that no donkey chased any monkey.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n1. **No donkeys chased a monkey.**\n   This is exactly what we derived: $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, \\neg C(d, m)$.\n   This statement must be true.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n   This means $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists m \\in M, C(d, m)$.\n   This contradicts our derivation that no donkey chased any monkey. So, this is false.\n\n3. **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n   This means $\\exists d \\in D, \\exists m \\in M, C(d, m)$.\n   This contradicts our derivation that no donkey chased any monkey. So, this is false.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n   This statement is a logical contradiction in itself. \"Not all donkeys will run\" means $\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, \\text{runs}(d))$, which is equivalent to $\\exists d \\in D, \\neg \\text{runs}(d)$.\n   \"Every donkey will run\" means $\\forall d \\in D, \\text{runs}(d)$.\n   These two parts cannot both be true simultaneously. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n   This means $\\exists d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, C(d, m)$.\n   This contradicts our derivation that no donkey chased any monkey. So, this is false.\n\n6. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   This means $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, C(d, m)$.\n   This contradicts our derivation that no donkey chased any monkey. So, this is false.\n\nThe third statement (\"Every monkey chased every human that chased every monkey\") was not needed to derive the truth of option 1. It might be relevant if we were asked about humans or other relationships, but for the options provided, the first two statements are sufficient.\n\nFinal Answer: The only statement that must be true is \"No donkeys chased a monkey.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

If Alfred is a human or a donkey, we have no information about his happiness. If Alfred is a monkey, then Alfred is happy. But we don't know Alfred's type.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 2: A monkey is happy but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n\n*   \"A monkey is happy\" is directly given (M -> Happy). This part is true.\n*   \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" means \u00ac(\u00acSee(L,H)), which simplifies to See(L,H).\n*   However, we are directly given \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" (\u00acSee(L,H)).\n*   So, the second part of this statement (See(L,H)) is false.\n*   Since the second part is false, the entire conjunction (\"but\" implies \"and\") is false.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true; in fact, it must be false.\n\n**Statement 3: Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n\n*   Similar to Statement 1, we have no information about Alfred's happiness.\n*   We also have no information about Lewis's happiness. Lewis could be a donkey, human, or monkey. If Lewis is a monkey, then Lewis is happy. But we don't know Lewis's type.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey is happy and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n\n*   \"A monkey is happy\" is directly given (M -> Happy). This part is true.\n*   \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" is directly given (\u00acSee(L,H)). This part is true.\n*   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire conjunction is true.\n*   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Hazel is happy if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis.**\n\n*   We have no information about Hazel's happiness.\n*   We have no information about whether monkeys saw Lewis.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel are happy.**\n\n*   Similar to Statement 1, we have no information about Alfred's happiness.\n*   Similar to Statement 5, we have no information about Hazel's happiness.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information provided, only Statement 4 is necessarily true. The complex conditional statement (point 5 in the \"Given Information\") about Lewis, donkeys, and monkeys is not needed to evaluate these options, as the options primarily test direct recall of facts or simple deductions from them.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n*   **Donkey-Human Kicking:** Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it. (This implies a reciprocal kicking relationship for every donkey).\n*   **Alfred-Lewis Seeing (Donkeys Drank):** Alfred doesn't see Lewis (A $\\not\\to$ SL) unless only donkeys drank (ODD). This means: If A SL, then ODD. Or, contrapositively: If not ODD, then A $\\not\\to$ SL.\n*   **Monkey Kicking-Seeing Lewis:** If every monkey kicked Lewis (EMKL), then every monkey saw Lewis (EMSL).\n*   **Human Saw Lewis & Donkeys Chasing Alfred:** A human saw Lewis (HSL) AND not all donkeys chased Alfred (NDCA).\n*   **Monkey Drank & Kicked Alfred:** Every monkey drank (EMD) AND a monkey kicked Alfred (MKA).\n\n**Analysis of Key Information:**\n\n1.  **\"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it.\"**\n    *   Let 'd' be any donkey.\n    *   There exists a human 'h' such that 'd' kicked 'h' AND 'h' kicked 'd'.\n    *   This directly implies that there must be at least one instance of a donkey kicking a human.\n\n2.  **\"A human saw Lewis (HSL) AND not all donkeys chased Alfred (NDCA).\"**\n    *   This tells us HSL is true.\n    *   This tells us NDCA is true.\n\n3.  **\"Every monkey drank (EMD) AND a monkey kicked Alfred (MKA).\"**\n    *   This tells us EMD is true.\n    *   This tells us MKA is true.\n\n4.  **Connecting \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank\" with \"Every monkey drank\":**\n    *   We know EMD (Every monkey drank).\n    *   If every monkey drank, then it's *not* true that \"only donkeys drank\" (unless there are no monkeys, which contradicts \"at least one of each\").\n    *   So, \"only donkeys drank\" (ODD) is false.\n    *   From \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank\" (A $\\not\\to$ SL unless ODD), which is equivalent to \"If A SL, then ODD\".\n    *   Since ODD is false, it must be that \"Alfred sees Lewis\" (A SL) is also false. So, Alfred does not see Lewis. This piece of information doesn't directly help with the donkey-human kicking statements, but it's a valid deduction.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's go through each statement and determine if it *must* be true based on the given information.\n\n*   **1. A donkey kicked a human.**\n    *   From \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it,\" if there is at least one donkey (which there is), then that donkey must have kicked a human.\n    *   **MUST BE TRUE.**\n\n*   **2. Every donkey kicked every human.**\n    *   The statement \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it\" means for *each* donkey, there's *some* human it kicked (and who kicked it back). It does *not* mean that every donkey kicked *all* humans. There could be a donkey D1 that kicked H1, and a donkey D2 that kicked H2, but D1 didn't kick H2, and D2 didn't kick H1.\n    *   **NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.**\n\n*   **3. A donkey kicked every human.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one specific donkey that kicked all the humans. The given information only states that *every* donkey kicked *a* human (that kicked it). It doesn't guarantee that one donkey is so prolific in its kicking.\n    *   **NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.**\n\n*   **4. No donkeys kicked a human.**\n    *   This directly contradicts statement 1, which we've established must be true. If \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it\" is true, then it's impossible for \"No donkeys kicked a human\" to be true.\n    *   **MUST BE FALSE.** (Therefore, it cannot be true).\n\n*   **5. There is a donkey that every human kicked.**\n    *   The given information states \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it.\" This is about donkeys initiating the kick (and getting one back). It doesn't say anything about humans kicking *every* donkey, or even that there's one specific donkey that *all* humans kicked.\n    *   **NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.**\n\n*   **6. No donkeys kicked every human.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 3 (\"A donkey kicked every human\").\n    *   Since we determined that statement 3 is \"NOT NECESSARILY TRUE\" (meaning it *could* be false), its negation \"No donkeys kicked every human\" *could* be true. However, \"not necessarily true\" for statement 3 doesn't mean statement 6 *must* be true. It just means statement 3 isn't guaranteed.\n    *   Consider a scenario: D1 kicked H1, H2. D2 kicked H1, H2. In this case, D1 kicked every human, and D2 kicked every human. So, \"A donkey kicked every human\" would be true, and \"No donkeys kicked every human\" would be false.\n    *   Consider another scenario: D1 kicked H1. D2 kicked H2. (Assume H1 and H2 are the only humans). In this case, no single donkey kicked every human. So, \"A donkey kicked every human\" is false, and \"No donkeys kicked every human\" is true.\n    *   Since both scenarios are possible given the initial conditions, this statement is **NOT NECESSARILY TRUE**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means there exists at least one human-monkey pair where they saw each other.\n4.  **Conditional Statement:** (Every human saw Hazel) OR (Every donkey chased Alfred).

(\u00acB)\n    *   NOT (Every donkey kicked Alfred) -> This means there is at least one donkey that did *not* kick Alfred.\n\n**Analysis of the Conditional Statement (A OR B):**\n\nFrom point 5, we know that \u00acB is true (Not all donkeys chased Alfred).\nSince (A OR B) is true and \u00acB is true, it logically follows that A must be true.\nTherefore, **\"Every human saw Hazel\" (A) must be true.**\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement based on this deduction and the other given information.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n**Statement 1: Hazel saw a human.**\n\n*   We know \"Every human saw Hazel.\" This means for any human 'h', 'h saw Hazel'.\n*   However, this doesn't tell us anything about what Hazel saw. Hazel could be a human, a donkey, or a monkey.\n*   If Hazel is a human, then Hazel saw herself (which is possible but not guaranteed to be *a* human in the sense of another human).\n*   If Hazel is a donkey or a monkey, we have no information about what she saw.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.**\n\n*   We know \"Every human saw Hazel\" is true. This means \"a human saw Hazel\" is true.\n*   So the right side of the \"if and only if\" (iff) statement is true.\n*   For the entire iff statement to be true, the left side (\"Hazel isn't a human\") must also be true.\n*   However, we don't know if Hazel is a human or not. Hazel could be a human, a donkey, or a monkey.\n*   If Hazel *is* a human, then \"Hazel isn't a human\" is false. In this case, (False iff True) is False.\n*   If Hazel *isn't* a human, then \"Hazel isn't a human\" is true. In this case, (True iff True) is True.\n*   Since we don't know Hazel's category, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: No humans saw Hazel.**\n\n*   We deduced that \"Every human saw Hazel\" is true.\n*   This statement directly contradicts our deduction.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 4: Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n\n*   We deduced that \"Every human saw Hazel\" is true.\n*   This statement directly contradicts our deduction.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 5: Every human saw Hazel.**\n\n*   As deduced from the conditional statement and the donkey information, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 6: Hazel saw every human.**\n\n*   We know \"Every human saw Hazel.\" This means the humans are the ones doing the seeing.\n*   This statement implies Hazel is the one doing the seeing, and she saw *all* humans.\n*   We have no information about what Hazel saw, let alone if she saw *every* human.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the logical deductions, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

It means if someone is a human, they *will* run. Since we know there's at least one human (from 2), it implies that at least one human will run.\n\n*   **From (7) \"A human saw Lewis (H_saw_L) but it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey (Hazel is not M)\":**\n    *   \"A human saw Lewis\" confirms that there is at least one human who saw Lewis.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey\" means Hazel is either a human or a donkey.\n\n*   **Revisiting (3) \"Every human will run\":**\n    *   This directly implies that \"A human will run\" (statement 6) must be true, because there's at least one human.\n    *   This also implies that \"Not all humans will run\" (statement 5) must be **false**. If *every* human will run, then it's not true that *not all* humans will run.\n\n*   **Using the implication from (3) on (6):** Since \"Every human will run\" is true and there is at least one human, \"A human will run\" (statement 6) must be true.\n\n*   **Using the implication from (3) on (5):** Since \"Every human will run\" is true, \"Not all humans will run\" (statement 5) must be false.\n\n*   **Now let's look at (6) \"Not all humans kicked Alfred if and only if not all humans saw Hazel\":**\n    *   We just determined that \"Not all humans will run\" is false.\n    *   Let's consider the implications for \"Not all humans kicked Alfred\" and \"Not all humans saw Hazel\".\n    *   This statement (6) doesn't directly relate to running, so it doesn't help us confirm or deny the running statements.\n\n*   **Let's evaluate the given options based on \"Every human will run\":**\n\n    *   **1. Only humans will run.**\n        *   We know \"Every human will run.\"\n        *   Do we know that *only* humans will run? The problem states \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively)\". It doesn't say anything about donkeys or monkeys running or not running. They *could* run. So, we cannot definitively say \"Only humans will run.\" This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n    *   **2. Only humans will run and not all humans will run.**\n        *   We already established that \"Not all humans will run\" is false (because \"Every human will run\" is true).\n        *   Therefore, this entire conjunction is false.\n\n    *   **3. Only humans will run and no humans will run.**\n        *   We know \"Every human will run\" is true, which means \"No humans will run\" is false.\n        *   Therefore, this entire conjunction is false.\n\n    *   **4. No humans will run.**\n        *   This contradicts \"Every human will run.\" So, this is false.\n\n    *   **5. Not all humans will run.**\n        *   This contradicts \"Every human will run.\" So, this is false.\n\n    *   **6. A human will run.**\n        *   Since \"Every human will run\" is true, and we are told there is \"at least one of each\" (including humans), it logically follows that \"A human will run\" must be true. If every single human runs, and there's at least one human, then at least one human will run.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct statement \"Every human will run\" and the existence of at least one human, the only statement that *must* be true is \"A human will run.\" The other statements either contradict the given information or cannot be definitively proven true or false with the information provided.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

Not all humans will run.**\n    *   We are given \"No humans will run.\"\n    *   If no humans will run, then it is certainly true that not all humans will run (because zero humans will run, which is less than all humans).\n    *   This statement *must* be true.\n\n*   **4. Every human will run.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No humans will run.\"\n    *   This statement *must be false*.\n\n*   **5. Only humans will run.**\n    *   We are given \"No humans will run.\"\n    *   If no humans will run, then it is vacuously true that \"Only humans will run\" (because if something runs, it must be a human, as no non-humans are running, and no humans are running either).\n    *   This statement *must* be true.\n\n*   **6. A human will run.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No humans will run.\"\n    *   This statement *must be false*.\n\n**Revisiting the Options and \"Must Be True\":**\n\nWe are looking for statements that *must* be true.\n\nFrom the given information, we have: **\"No humans will run.\"**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on this definitive fact:\n\n*   **1. Only humans will run and not all humans will run.**\n    *   \"No humans will run\" implies \"not all humans will run\" (true).\n    *   \"No humans will run\" implies \"only humans will run\" (vacuously true, as nothing runs, so anything that runs must be a human).\n    *   Since both conjuncts are true, statement 1 *must be true*.\n\n*   **2. Only humans will run and no humans will run.**\n    *   \"No humans will run\" is directly given (true).\n    *   \"No humans will run\" implies \"only humans will run\" (vacuously true).\n    *   Since both conjuncts are true, statement 2 *must be true*.\n\n*   **3. Not all humans will run.**\n    *   \"No humans will run\" implies \"not all humans will run\" (true).\n    *   This statement *must be true*.\n\n*   **4. Every human will run.**\n    *   This contradicts \"No humans will run.\" *Must be false*.\n\n*   **5. Only humans will run.**\n    *   \"No humans will run\" implies \"only humans will run\" (vacuously true).\n    *   This statement *must be true*.\n\n*   **6. A human will run.**\n    *   This contradicts \"No humans will run.\" *Must be false*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, 3, and 5 all *must be true* based on the direct information \"No humans will run.\" The question asks \"Which, if any, of the following statements must be true\". It doesn't ask for *the only* one.\n\nLet's double-check the interpretation of \"Only humans will run.\"\nIf \"Only humans will run\" means \"If X runs, then X is a human,\" then it is vacuously true if no one runs.\nIf \"Only humans will run\" implies that *some* humans will run, then it would contradict \"No humans will run.\" However, the standard logical interpretation of \"Only A are B\" is \"If X is B, then X is A.\" This does not imply that any B's exist.\n\nGiven the standard logical interpretation, all of 1, 2, 3, and 5 are true.\n\nHowever, in multiple-choice questions of this type, sometimes there's an expectation for the *most precise* or *most direct* answer.\n\nLet's consider the options again:\n*   \"No humans will run\" is given.\n*   Option 2: \"Only humans will run and no humans will run.\" This option *explicitly includes* the given information \"no humans will run\" as one of its conjuncts. The other conjunct (\"Only humans will run\") is a logical consequence (vacuously true) of \"no humans will run.\" Therefore, this statement is a direct and complete logical consequence.\n\nLet's compare 2 with 1, 3, and 5.\n*   Statement 3 (\"Not all humans will run\") is true, but less specific than \"No humans will run.\"\n*   Statement 5 (\"Only humans will run\") is true, but it's a vacuously true statement that doesn't fully capture the \"no humans\" part.\n*   Statement 1 (\"Only humans will run and not all humans will run\") is true, but it's a combination.\n\nStatement 2 is the most direct and complete representation of the given fact \"No humans will run\" among the options, as it explicitly states \"no humans will run\" and combines it with a vacuously true consequence.\n\nThe problem asks \"Which, if any, of the following statements must be true\". If multiple are true, then all true ones are valid answers. However, in typical logical reasoning problems, if one option *contains* the direct given information and its immediate logical consequences, it's often the intended answer.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options assuming a single best answer is expected.\n\nThe most direct and encompassing statement that *must be true* given \"No humans will run\" is the one that explicitly states \"no humans will run.\"\n\n*   \"No humans will run\" is a direct premise.\n*   Option 2 is \"Only humans will run AND no humans will run.\"\n    *   The second part is the premise itself.\n    *   The first part (\"Only humans will run\") is vacuously true if \"no humans will run\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, the entire conjunction is true.\n\nThis makes Option 2 the strongest candidate because it directly incorporates the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Initial Facts:**\n* Alfred is a monkey (M).\n* Hazel saw Lewis.\n\n**3. Conditional Statements (Let's use propositional logic for clarity):**\n\n* **P1:** If not all humans are asleep (\u00ac\u2200h(asleep(h))), then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry (\u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) \u2192 hungry(Lewis)).\n    * This can be rewritten as: \u00ac\u2200h(asleep(h)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) \u2192 hungry(Lewis))\n\n* **P2:** If not all humans are asleep (\u00ac\u2200h(asleep(h))), then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry (hungry(Lewis) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203h(hungry(h))).\n    * This can be rewritten as: \u00ac\u2200h(asleep(h)) \u2192 (hungry(Lewis) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203h(hungry(h)))\n\n* **P3:** Only donkeys are asleep (\u2200x(asleep(x) \u2192 donkey(x))).\n    * This means if something is asleep, it must be a donkey.

Re-evaluating P1 and P2 based on Hazel being a donkey:**\n\n* Since Hazel is a donkey, and there's at least one donkey, it's possible for \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" or \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n\n**6. Consider the state of humans being asleep:**\n\n* From P3, \"Only donkeys are asleep.\" This means no humans are asleep.\n* Therefore, \"not all humans are asleep\" (\u00ac\u2200h(asleep(h))) is **TRUE**. (Because if all humans were asleep, they would have to be donkeys, which contradicts them being humans).\n\n**7. Apply the truth of \"not all humans are asleep\" to P1 and P2:**\n\n* Since \u00ac\u2200h(asleep(h)) is TRUE, the antecedents of P1 and P2 are true.\n* **From P1:** (\u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) \u2192 hungry(Lewis)) must be true.\n* **From P2:** (hungry(Lewis) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203h(hungry(h))) must be true.\n\n**8. Analyze P2 further:**\n\n* (hungry(Lewis) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203h(hungry(h)))\n* If Lewis is hungry, then no humans are hungry.\n\n**9. Analyze P1 further:**\n\n* (\u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) \u2192 hungry(Lewis))\n* This means if it's not the case that all donkeys saw Hazel, then Lewis is hungry.\n\n**10. Let's consider the implications for Lewis's hunger:**\n\n* **Scenario A: Lewis is hungry.**\n    * If Lewis is hungry, then from P2, no humans are hungry.\n    * From P1, if Lewis is hungry, then the implication (\u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) \u2192 hungry(Lewis)) is satisfied regardless of the truth of \u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)).\n\n* **Scenario B: Lewis is NOT hungry (\u00achungry(Lewis)).**\n    * If Lewis is not hungry, then from P2, (hungry(Lewis) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203h(hungry(h))) is still true (False implies anything is true).\n    * If Lewis is not hungry, then from P1, for (\u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) \u2192 hungry(Lewis)) to be true, the antecedent (\u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel))) must be false.\n    * If \u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) is false, then it must be true that **all donkeys saw Hazel (\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)))**.\n\n**11. What about Lewis seeing donkeys?**\n\nWe know Hazel saw Lewis. We know Hazel is a donkey.\nTherefore, **a donkey (Hazel) saw Lewis.** This makes statement 4 true.\n\nLet's re-examine the options:\n\n1.  **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.** (Could be true, could be false)\n2.  **Lewis saw every donkey.** (No information to confirm this)\n3.  **Every donkey saw Lewis.** (No information to confirm this)\n4.  **A donkey saw Lewis.** **TRUE.** We know Hazel is a donkey and Hazel saw Lewis.\n5.  **Lewis saw a donkey.** (No information to confirm this. We only know Hazel saw Lewis, not the other way around.)\n6.  **No donkeys saw Lewis.** (FALSE, because Hazel, a donkey, saw Lewis.)\n\nLet's double-check if we can deduce anything more about Lewis's hunger or the donkeys seeing Hazel.\n\nWe established that \"not all humans are asleep\" is true.\nThis means:\n(\u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) \u2192 hungry(Lewis)) is true.\n(hungry(Lewis) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203h(hungry(h))) is true.\n\nConsider the possibility that Lewis is not hungry.\nIf Lewis is not hungry, then from (\u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) \u2192 hungry(Lewis)), it must be that \u00ac\u2200d(saw(d, Hazel)) is false.\nThis means **all donkeys saw Hazel**.\n\nSo, either Lewis is hungry, or all donkeys saw Hazel.\n\nHowever, none of this directly tells us about Lewis seeing donkeys, or all donkeys seeing Lewis, beyond the fact that Hazel (a donkey) saw Lewis.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information is that a donkey saw Lewis, because we know Hazel is a donkey and Hazel saw Lewis.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n*   Everything is a donkey (D), human (H), or monkey (M) (exclusively).\n*   There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n*   **Rule 1:** No monkeys saw a monkey. (This is a crucial negative constraint)\n*   **Rule 2:** A monkey saw a human that saw a human.\n*   **Rule 3:** A monkey kicked a monkey that kicked a human.\n*   **Rule 4:** If Alfred doesn't see Alfred, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel. (This rule seems to apply to specific individuals, Alfred and Hazel, and might not be generalizable to all monkeys/humans without more context. It's a conditional statement about specific actions.)\n*   **Rule 5:** If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if every monkey saw Hazel. (Similar to Rule 4, this is a conditional statement about specific individuals and a state (asleep) that isn't directly related to the \"seeing\" or \"kicking\" actions of the other rules.)\n\n**Analyzing the Statements based on Rule 1: \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\"**\n\nThis rule is the most powerful for evaluating the given options. It directly contradicts any statement that implies a monkey saw another monkey (or itself).\n\nLet's examine each statement:\n\n1.  **Every monkey saw every monkey.**\n    *   This statement implies that if there are monkeys M1, M2, M3, then M1 saw M2, M1 saw M3, M2 saw M1, M2 saw M3, etc.\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n2.  **A monkey saw every monkey.**\n    *   This statement implies there exists at least one monkey (let's call it M_x) such that M_x saw every other monkey (and potentially itself if \"every monkey\" includes M_x).\n    *   If M_x saw any other monkey, it contradicts \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n3.  **A monkey saw every monkey that saw it.**\n    *   This statement implies there exists a monkey (M_x) such that for any monkey (M_y) that saw M_x, M_x saw M_y.\n    *   However, we know \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\" This means no M_y saw M_x if M_y is a monkey.\n    *   If no monkey saw M_x, then the condition \"every monkey that saw it\" is vacuously true (there are no such monkeys).\n    *   But the statement still requires \"A monkey saw...\" which means M_x must have seen *something*. If M_x saw any monkey (even if that monkey didn't see M_x), it violates Rule 1.\n    *   Let's rephrase: \"There exists a monkey M1 such that for all monkeys M2, if M2 saw M1, then M1 saw M2.\"\n    *   From Rule 1, \"No monkeys saw a monkey,\" we know that for any M1, there is no M2 (where M2 is a monkey) such that M2 saw M1.\n    *   This means the premise \"M2 saw M1\" is always false.\n    *   Therefore, the implication \"if M2 saw M1, then M1 saw M2\" is always true (False implies anything is true).\n    *   So, \"A monkey saw every monkey that saw it\" is vacuously true *if we only consider the implication*.\n    *   However, the statement \"A monkey saw...\" implies that the monkey *did* see something. If it saw a monkey, it's false. If it saw a human or donkey, it doesn't violate Rule 1.\n    *   The statement is \"A monkey saw every monkey that saw it.\" This means if there's a monkey M1, and a monkey M2 saw M1, then M1 saw M2. But since no monkey saw a monkey, the premise \"M2 saw M1\" is always false. So the implication is always true.\n    *   This statement is tricky. It doesn't assert that a monkey *did* see a monkey. It asserts a conditional relationship. Since the condition (\"a monkey saw it\") is never met, the statement is vacuously true.\n    *   Let's consider the phrasing carefully: \"A monkey saw every monkey that saw it.\" This means \"There exists a monkey X such that for all monkeys Y, if Y saw X, then X saw Y.\"\n    *   From \"No monkeys saw a monkey,\" we know that for any X and Y (both monkeys), \"Y saw X\" is false.\n    *   Therefore, the implication \"if Y saw X, then X saw Y\" is always true (False => Anything is True).\n    *   Since this implication is always true for any monkey X, then \"There exists a monkey X such that [always true]\" is also true.\n    *   So, this statement **must be true** due to the vacuous truth of the conditional.\n\n4.  **There is a monkey that every monkey saw.**\n    *   This statement implies there exists at least one monkey (let's call it M_y) such that every other monkey (M_x) saw M_y.\n    *   If any M_x saw M_y, it contradicts \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n5.  **Every monkey saw a monkey.**\n    *   This statement implies that for every monkey (M_x), M_x saw at least one other monkey (M_y).\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n6.  **A monkey saw a monkey.**\n    *   This statement implies there exists at least one monkey (M_x) that saw at least one other monkey (M_y).\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion based on Rule 1:**\n\nOnly statement 3, \"A monkey saw every monkey that saw it,\" can be true, and it is true due to vacuous truth. The other statements directly assert or imply that a monkey saw a monkey, which is forbidden by Rule 1.\n\nRules 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not contradict Rule 1. They provide additional information about interactions between different types of beings (monkeys seeing humans, monkeys kicking humans, etc.) or specific individuals, but they don't change the fundamental constraint that monkeys cannot see other monkeys.\n\nThe key to this problem is the absolute nature of \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

(This is a direct and strong statement).\n4.  **Human-Monkey Interaction:** Every human kicked every monkey that kicked it. (This describes a reciprocal kicking action).\n5.  **Monkey-Lewis/Donkey-Hazel/Alfred:** If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.

Lewis could have chased a human, or not.

Alfred saw every donkey.**\n    *   The given information is \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\" This means for any donkey 'x', 'x saw Alfred'.\n    *   This does *not* necessarily mean \"Alfred saw every donkey.\" Seeing is not always reciprocal. If I saw a tree, it doesn't mean the tree saw me.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **2. Alfred saw a donkey.**\n    *   Since \"Every donkey saw Alfred,\" and we know there is at least one donkey (from point 2), it means that at least one donkey saw Alfred.\n    *   If a donkey saw Alfred, it implies that Alfred was present and perceivable by that donkey. While it doesn't *directly* state Alfred's perception, the phrasing \"Alfred saw a donkey\" is often used in a context where if one entity perceives another, the other entity is also perceivable. However, strictly logically, \"X saw Y\" does not imply \"Y saw X\".\n    *   Let's re-evaluate this. If \"Every donkey saw Alfred\", then Alfred was in a position to be seen by every donkey. This doesn't mean Alfred *perceived* every donkey. So, this statement is not necessarily true based *solely* on the given premise.\n\n*   **3. No donkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts point 3: \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **4. A donkey saw Alfred.**\n    *   From point 3: \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\"\n    *   From point 2: \"there's at least one of each\" (meaning at least one donkey exists).\n    *   If every donkey saw Alfred, and there is at least one donkey, then it logically follows that at least one donkey saw Alfred. This is a direct consequence.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n*   **5. Alfred will run.**\n    *   The information about Alfred running comes from point 4: \"Lewis will run or no donkeys are happy.\" This statement is a disjunction. It doesn't tell us anything definitive about Alfred running.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **6. Not all donkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts point 3: \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" and \"there's at least one of each\" (implying at least one donkey exists), only statement 4 logically follows.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

More directly, if Lewis saw Hazel, and Hazel is a monkey, then Lewis saw *a* monkey. This statement says *no* monkeys saw Lewis, which is different from Lewis seeing a monkey. However, the statement \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" means that for every monkey, that monkey did not see Lewis. We know Lewis saw Hazel. This doesn't tell us if Hazel saw Lewis. Let's re-evaluate this after checking other options.\n\n2.  **Every monkey saw Lewis.** We only know Lewis saw Hazel. We don't have information about other monkeys seeing Lewis. This is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Lewis saw every monkey.** We only know Lewis saw Hazel. We don't have information about Lewis seeing all other monkeys. This is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **A monkey saw Lewis.** We know Lewis saw Hazel. We do not know if Hazel saw Lewis. So, we cannot definitively say \"A monkey saw Lewis.\"\n\n5.  **Not all monkeys saw Lewis.** We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this. We only know about Lewis seeing Hazel.\n\n6.  **Lewis saw a monkey.** From \"Lewis saw Hazel\" and \"Hazel is a monkey,\" this statement is **TRUE**. Lewis saw Hazel, and Hazel is a monkey, therefore Lewis saw a monkey.\n\nLet's re-examine statement 1: \"No monkeys saw Lewis.\"\nIf Lewis saw Hazel (a monkey), this statement is about whether *monkeys* saw Lewis. We know Lewis saw Hazel. We don't know if Hazel saw Lewis. So, we cannot definitively say \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" is true or false based on the given information.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the direct deductions is statement 6.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

It's likely a distractor for this specific set of questions.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nWe need to determine which statements *must* be true based on the premises.\n\n**Statement 1: \"Every donkey kicked a human.\"**\n\n*   From premise 2, we know: For every $h \\in H$ and every $d \\in D$, $h$ kicked $d$.\n*   This premise describes humans kicking donkeys. It does *not* provide any information about donkeys kicking humans.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that every donkey kicked a human. It's possible no donkey kicked any human.\n*   **False (not necessarily true).**\n\n**Statement 2: \"No donkeys kicked every human.\"**\n\n*   Again, premise 2 tells us about humans kicking donkeys. We have no information about donkeys kicking humans.\n*   It's possible that some donkey *did* kick every human (e.g., if there's only one human, and a donkey kicked that human). It's also possible no donkey kicked any human.\n*   We cannot definitively say \"No donkeys kicked every human.\"\n*   **False (not necessarily true).**\n\n**Statement 3: \"A donkey kicked a human.\"**\n\n*   Similar to statements 1 and 2, we have no information about donkeys kicking humans.\n*   It's entirely possible that no donkey kicked any human.\n*   **False (not necessarily true).**\n\n**Statement 4: \"Every donkey kicked every human.\"**\n\n*   This is the strongest claim about donkeys kicking humans.\n*   As established, we have no information supporting donkeys kicking humans.\n*   **False (not necessarily true).**\n\n**Statement 5: \"A donkey kicked every human.\"**\n\n*   This is weaker than statement 4, but still requires at least one donkey to have kicked every human.\n*   We have no information about donkeys kicking humans.\n*   **False (not necessarily true).**\n\n**Statement 6: \"There is a donkey that every human kicked.\"**\n\n*   Let's re-examine premise 2: \"Every human kicked every donkey.\"\n*   This means: For any human $h \\in H$, and for any donkey $d \\in D$, $h$ kicked $d$.\n*   Consider any specific donkey, say $d_0 \\in D$.\n*   According to premise 2, every human $h \\in H$ kicked $d_0$.\n*   Since the set of donkeys $D$ is non-empty (there's at least one donkey), we can pick any donkey. Let's pick an arbitrary donkey $d_x \\in D$.\n*   Premise 2 states that *every* human kicked *every* donkey. This means that for our chosen $d_x$, every human in $H$ kicked $d_x$.\n*   Therefore, $d_x$ is a donkey that every human kicked. Since we can pick *any* donkey and this holds true, it means \"There is a donkey that every human kicked\" is true. In fact, *every* donkey is a donkey that every human kicked.\n\n*   **True.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 6 must be true. The premise \"Every human kicked every donkey\" directly implies that for any given donkey, every human kicked it. Since there is at least one donkey, there is indeed a donkey (in fact, all of them) that every human kicked.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

Donkeys might or might not see Hazel.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: A donkey saw Hazel.**\n\n*   Similar to Statement 1, the fact that Hazel saw every donkey doesn't tell us if any donkey saw Hazel.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: Every donkey saw Hazel.**\n\n*   Again, Hazel seeing every donkey is different from every donkey seeing Hazel.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Hazel saw a donkey.**\n\n*   The given information states: \"Hazel saw every donkey.\"\n*   If Hazel saw *every* donkey, and we know there is *at least one* donkey, then it logically follows that Hazel must have seen at least one donkey.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel.**\n\n*   This is the negation of Statement 3 (\"Every donkey saw Hazel\").\n*   As established, we don't know if every donkey saw Hazel. We also don't know if *not* all donkeys saw Hazel. It's possible all donkeys saw Hazel, or it's possible some did and some didn't, or none did.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n\n*   This is a compound statement. For it to be true, both parts must be true.\n*   **Part 1: Not all donkeys saw Hazel.** (Same as Statement 5, not necessarily true).\n*   **Part 2: Hazel saw Hazel.** This is a self-referential statement. While it's plausible that a human (Hazel) can see themselves (e.g., in a mirror), the problem doesn't provide any information to confirm this. It's not a logical deduction from the given premises.\n*   Since neither part is necessarily true based on the given information, the entire compound statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

This is a self-referential action. In typical logical contexts, an entity cannot simultaneously perform and not perform an action on itself. If we assume actions are well-defined and non-contradictory, then \"Hz did not chase Hz\" is either true or false.\n    *   However, the phrasing \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is a condition. If Hazel *did* chase Hazel, then \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is false. If Hazel *didn't* chase Hazel, then \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is true.\n    *   Let's consider the implication: (\u2200m \u2208 M, m chased Hz) \u21d2 (Hz did not chase Hz).\n    *   If (Hz did not chase Hz) is false (meaning Hz *did* chase Hz), then for the implication to be true, (\u2200m \u2208 M, m chased Hz) must be false.\n    *   If (Hz did not chase Hz) is true (meaning Hz *did not* chase Hz), then the implication is true regardless of (\u2200m \u2208 M, m chased Hz).\n\n    *   Let's re-evaluate \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\". This is a statement about Hazel's action. It's not inherently contradictory like \"P and not P\".

It's not a logical paradox in itself.\n\n**Analyzing the Target Statements:**\n\nWe need to determine which of the following must be true:\n\n1.  **A donkey saw a human.** (\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H such that d saw h)\n2.  **Every donkey saw a human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H such that d saw h)\n3.  **No donkeys saw a human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, d did not see h)\n4.  **Every donkey saw every human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, d saw h)\n5.  **No donkeys saw every human.** (\u00ac(\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, d saw h)) OR (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H such that d did not see h)\n6.  **A donkey saw every human.** (\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, d saw h)\n\n**Using Rule 1: No donkeys saw Lewis and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n\n*   We know Hazel (Hz) is a human.\n*   Rule 1 states: \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n*   This means: \u2200d \u2208 D, d did not see Hz.\n\nNow let's look at the options in light of this:\n\n*   **1. A donkey saw a human.** (\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H such that d saw h)\n    *   We know d did not see Hz (a human). This statement doesn't contradict it. It's possible some other human was seen by a donkey. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this.\n\n*   **2. Every donkey saw a human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H such that d saw h)\n    *   This means for every donkey, there exists *some* human that donkey saw. This doesn't contradict d not seeing Hz.\n\n*   **3. No donkeys saw a human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, d did not see h)\n    *   This statement says that for *every* donkey and *every* human, the donkey did not see that human.\n    *   We know from Rule 1 that \"No donkeys saw Hazel\". Since Hazel is a human, this means for every donkey, that donkey did not see Hazel. This is consistent with statement 3.\n    *   However, statement 3 is stronger. It says *no* donkey saw *any* human. Rule 1 only tells us about Hazel.\n    *   Let's re-read Rule 1 carefully: \"No donkeys saw Lewis and no donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    *   This means: (\u2200d \u2208 D, d did not see L) AND (\u2200d \u2208 D, d did not see Hz).\n    *   Since Hz is a human, this means: **For every donkey, that donkey did not see Hazel.**\n    *   This is a specific instance of \"No donkeys saw a human.\"\n    *   Does this *force* \"No donkeys saw a human\" to be true? No. There could be other humans besides Hazel. A donkey might not have seen Hazel, but it could have seen another human, say, Bob.\n\n*   **4. Every donkey saw every human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, d saw h)\n    *   This directly contradicts Rule 1, which states that no donkeys saw Hazel (a human). If every donkey saw every human, then every donkey would have seen Hazel, which is false.\n    *   Therefore, statement 4 **must be false**.\n\n*   **5. No donkeys saw every human.** (\u00ac(\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, d saw h))\n    *   This means \"It is not the case that there exists a donkey that saw every human.\"\n    *   Let's consider the opposite: \"A donkey saw every human\" (Statement 6).\n    *   If Statement 6 were true, then there would be at least one donkey (let's call it Donkey X) that saw *every* human.\n    *   Since Hazel is a human, Donkey X would have seen Hazel.\n    *   But Rule 1 states \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" This means *no* donkey saw Hazel.\n    *   This creates a contradiction. If Donkey X saw Hazel, it contradicts Rule 1.\n    *   Therefore, the premise \"A donkey saw every human\" (Statement 6) must be false.\n    *   If Statement 6 is false, then its negation, Statement 5, **must be true**.\n\n*   **6.

We haven't used Rule 2 or 3 yet. Do we need them?\n\n*   **1. A donkey saw a human.** (\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H such that d saw h)\n    *   We know no donkey saw Hazel. But there could be other humans. We don't know if any donkey saw any *other* human. So, this is not necessarily true. It's also not necessarily false.\n\n*   **2. Every donkey saw a human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H such that d saw h)\n    *   This means for every donkey, there's at least one human it saw. This doesn't contradict \"no donkey saw Hazel\". It just means if a donkey didn't see Hazel, it must have seen some other human. We don't have information to confirm or deny this.\n\n*   **3. No donkeys saw a human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, d did not see h)\n    *   This means no donkey saw *any* human, including Hazel. We know no donkey saw Hazel. But we don't know if there are other humans that donkeys *also* didn't see. This statement is stronger than what we know. It's not necessarily true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information, specifically Rule 1 (\"No donkeys saw Hazel\"), is Statement 5.\n\nLet's re-state the argument for Statement 5:\n\n1.  We are given: \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" (Rule 1)\n2.  We are given: \"Hazel is a human.\"\n3.  From (1) and (2), it follows that: \"For every donkey, that donkey did not see Hazel.\"\n4.  Consider statement 6: \"A donkey saw every human.\" This means there exists at least one donkey (let's call it Donkey X) such that Donkey X saw *every single human*.\n5.  If Donkey X saw every single human, then Donkey X must have seen Hazel (because Hazel is a human).\n6.  But step (3) states that *no* donkey saw Hazel. This means it's impossible for any donkey (including Donkey X) to have seen Hazel.\n7.  Steps (5) and (6) are contradictory. Therefore, our assumption in step (4) (\"A donkey saw every human\") must be false.\n8.  Statement 5 is the negation of Statement 6. Since Statement 6 must be false, Statement 5 (\"No donkeys saw every human\") must be true.\n\nThe other rules (Rule 2 and Rule ",

(No donkeys or monkeys are hungry).\n    *   \"it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep\" simplifies to \"Hazel is asleep.\"\n\n**Deductions from Given Information:**\n\nFrom (4):\n*   **Hazel is asleep.** (Directly stated)\n*   **Only humans are hungry.** (Directly stated)\n\nFrom (2) and the deduction \"Only humans are hungry\":\n*   \"Hazel or Lewis are hungry.\"\n*   Since \"Only humans are hungry,\" both Hazel and Lewis must be humans if they are hungry.\n*   Therefore, **Hazel is a human** and **Lewis is a human**. (Because if they were donkeys or monkeys, they couldn't be hungry).\n\nNow let's re-evaluate the statements based on these deductions.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\n**Statement 1: Every human is hungry.**\n*   We know \"Only humans are hungry.\"\n*   We know \"Hazel or Lewis are hungry.\"\n*   We know Hazel and Lewis are humans.\n*   However, we have no information to conclude that *every* human is hungry. There could be other humans who are not hungry.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Statement 2: A human is hungry.**\n*   We know \"Hazel or Lewis are hungry.\"\n*   We know Hazel is a human and Lewis is a human.\n*   Therefore, either Hazel (a human) is hungry, or Lewis (a human) is hungry. In either case, at least one human is hungry.\n*   **Must be true? Yes.**\n\n**Statement 3: No humans are hungry.**\n*   This directly contradicts Statement 2, which we've determined must be true.\n*   Since \"Hazel or Lewis are hungry\" and both are humans, it's impossible for no humans to be hungry.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred is asleep.**\n*   We know \"Hazel is asleep.\"\n*   We have no information about Alfred's sleep status.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Statement 5: Not all humans are hungry.**\n*   We know \"A human is hungry\" (from Statement 2).\n*   We know \"Only humans are hungry.\"\n*   However, we don't have enough information to determine if *not all* humans are hungry. It's possible that *all* humans are hungry, or it's possible that *not all* humans are hungry. We cannot definitively say one way or the other.\n*   For example, if there are only two humans, Hazel and Lewis, and both are hungry, then \"all humans are hungry\" would be true, and \"not all humans are hungry\" would be false.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Statement 6: Only humans are hungry and not all humans are hungry.**\n*   We know \"Only humans are hungry\" is true (from the given information).\n*   However, as discussed for Statement 5, we cannot definitively conclude \"not all humans are hungry.\"\n*   Since the second part of the conjunction is not necessarily true, the entire conjunction is not necessarily true.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe only statement that is directly supported by the deductions is \"A human is hungry.\"\n1. Hazel or Lewis are hungry.\n2. Only humans are hungry.\n3. From (1) and (2), if Hazel is hungry, she must be a human. If Lewis is hungry, he must be a human.\n4. Therefore, either a human (Hazel) is hungry, or a human (Lewis) is hungry. In either case, at least one human is hungry.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(M2 saw A => L chased L)\n6.  **Hazel's Kicking (Conditional):** If not all donkeys saw Hazel (H), then Hazel kicked Alfred (A) ONLY IF not all donkeys kicked Hazel (H). (NOT (All D saw H) => (H kicked A <=> NOT (All D kicked H)))\n\n**Analysis of the Given Information:**\n\n*   **Point 5 (Monkey Saw Alfred):** \"Lewis chased Lewis\" is a tautology (always true). If Lewis exists, Lewis is Lewis, and Lewis chasing Lewis is a self-referential action that is inherently true if Lewis is capable of action. If Lewis doesn't exist, the statement is vacuously true in a logical sense (false premise implies anything). However, in typical logical puzzles, \"X chased X\" implies X exists and performed the action. If Lewis is a real entity in this world, then Lewis chased Lewis is true.\n    *   If \"Lewis chased Lewis\" is true, then the implication \"A monkey saw Alfred ONLY IF Lewis chased Lewis\" means that if a monkey saw Alfred, then Lewis chased Lewis. Since Lewis chased Lewis is true, it doesn't restrict whether a monkey saw Alfred. It just means that if a monkey *did* see Alfred, the condition is met.\n    *   More importantly, the \"ONLY IF\" means (M2 saw A) $\\implies$ (L chased L). Since (L chased L) is true, this statement provides no information about whether a monkey saw Alfred. It just says that if a monkey *did* see Alfred, it's consistent with Lewis chasing Lewis. It doesn't force a monkey to see Alfred, nor does it prevent it.\n    *   *Correction/Refinement:* The phrase \"A only if B\" means \"If A then B\" (A $\\implies$ B). So, \"A monkey saw Alfred ONLY IF Lewis chased Lewis\" means (A monkey saw Alfred) $\\implies$ (Lewis chased Lewis). Since \"Lewis chased Lewis\" is a self-referential truth (assuming Lewis exists and can perform actions), the consequent is true. When the consequent of an implication is true, the implication itself is true regardless of the truth value of the antecedent. Therefore, this statement (point 5) provides *no information* about whether a monkey saw Alfred. It's always true, and doesn't constrain the situation.\n\n*   **Point 6 (Hazel's Kicking):** This is a complex conditional.\n    *   Let P = \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    *   Let Q = \"Hazel kicked Alfred.\"\n    *   Let R = \"Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n    *   The statement is: P $\\implies$ (Q $\\iff$ R).\n    *   This statement is also very specific and doesn't seem to directly relate to donkeys seeing monkeys.\n\n*   **Key Information for Donkeys and Monkeys:**\n    *   There is at least one donkey (D) and at least one monkey (M).\n    *   There is a monkey (M1) that *every* donkey saw. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's re-examine the statements we need to evaluate for truth:\n\n1.  **There is a donkey that every monkey saw.**\n    *   We know there's a monkey (M1) that every donkey saw. This is the reverse.\n    *   We don't have information that guarantees a specific donkey was seen by *every* monkey. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **A donkey saw a monkey.**\n    *   From point 4, \"There is a monkey (M1) that every donkey saw.\"\n    *   If every donkey saw M1, then *at least one* donkey (in fact, *all* donkeys) saw M1.\n    *   Therefore, a donkey saw a monkey (specifically, M1).\n    *   **This statement must be true.**\n\n3.  **No donkeys saw every monkey.**\n    *   This means for every donkey, there is at least one monkey that donkey did not see.\n    *   We know there's a monkey (M1) that *every* donkey saw. This doesn't contradict \"No donkeys saw every monkey\" if there are other monkeys that some donkeys didn't see.\n    *   However, consider the possibility of only one monkey (M1). If there's only one monkey, then every donkey saw M1 (from point 4). In this case, every donkey *did* see every monkey (because M1 is the only monkey). This would make statement 3 false.\n    *   Since we can construct a scenario where statement 3 is false (e.g., only one monkey exists), statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **No donkeys saw a monkey.**\n    *   This means for every donkey, that donkey saw no monkeys.\n    *   This directly contradicts point 4: \"There is a monkey (M1) that every donkey saw.\"\n    *   If every donkey saw M1, then it's false that no donkeys saw a monkey.\n    *   **This statement must be false.** (Therefore, it cannot be true).\n\n5.  **Every donkey saw every monkey.**\n    *   We know every donkey saw M1. But we don't know if M1 is the *only* monkey.\n    *   If there are multiple monkeys (M1, M2, M3...), we don't know if every donkey saw M2 or M3.\n    *   For example, Donkey A saw M1. Donkey B saw M1. But maybe Donkey A didn't see M2, and Donkey B didn't see M3.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **A donkey saw every monkey.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one donkey (D_x) such that D_x saw *all* monkeys.\n    *   We know every donkey saw M1. This doesn't mean any single donkey saw *all* monkeys if there are other monkeys.\n    *   For example, if there are M1 and M2. Every donkey saw M1. But maybe no donkey saw M2. Or maybe Donkey A saw M1 and M2, but Donkey B only saw M1.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion based on the analysis:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information, particularly \"There is a monkey that every donkey saw,\" is statement 2.\n\nIf \"every donkey saw M1\", then it logically follows that \"a donkey saw a monkey\" (specifically, any donkey saw M1).\n\nFinal check:\n*   Statement 1: Not necessarily.\n*   Statement 2: Must be true. (If every D saw M1, then any D saw M1, so a D saw a M).\n*   Statement 3: Not necessarily. (Could be false if there's only one monkey).\n*   Statement 4: Must be false. (Directly contradicts \"every donkey saw M1\").\n*   Statement 5: Not necessarily. (Only know every D saw M1, not all other monkeys).\n*   Statement 6: Not necessarily. (Only know every D saw M1, not that any single D saw all monkeys).\n\nThe information about Alfred, Lewis, and Hazel is a distractor for the statements concerning donkeys and monkeys seeing each other.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Therefore, R is true.\n\nSince R is true, (Q \u2192 R) is true regardless of Q's truth value (True \u2192 True is True, False \u2192 True is True).\nAnd since (Q \u2192 R) is true, P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R) is also true regardless of P's truth value.\n\nTherefore, condition 5 provides no useful information about the relationships between monkeys, donkeys, or Lewis, as it's always true due to the tautological nature of \"Alfred saw Alfred.\"\n\n**Focus on Conditions 3 and 4:**\n\n*   **Condition 3:** There is a donkey (D1) that every monkey saw.\n    *   This means D1 exists.\n    *   Every monkey saw D1.\n\n*   **Condition 4:** Lewis saw every donkey.\n    *   This means Lewis exists.\n    *   Lewis saw D1.\n    *   Lewis saw any other donkey D_x that might exist.\n\n**Now let's evaluate the given statements:**\n\n1.  **No donkeys saw Lewis.**\n    *   We know Lewis saw every donkey. This statement is about donkeys seeing Lewis. We have no information about whether donkeys saw Lewis. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **A donkey saw Lewis.**\n    *   We know Lewis saw every donkey. We don't know if any donkey saw Lewis. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n    *   We don't know if any donkeys saw Lewis.\n    *   Is Lewis a donkey? Lewis saw *every* donkey. If Lewis were a donkey, then Lewis would have seen himself (as he is one of the donkeys). This is possible. We don't have information to confirm or deny Lewis being a donkey.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n    *   We know Lewis saw every donkey. This statement is about donkeys seeing Lewis. We have no information about whether donkeys saw Lewis. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **Lewis saw a donkey.**\n    *   Condition 4 explicitly states: \"Lewis saw every donkey.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one donkey (Condition 2, and specifically D1 from Condition 3), it follows directly that Lewis saw at least one donkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6.  **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 4. Since statement 4 is not necessarily true, its negation is also not necessarily true. We simply don't have information about donkeys seeing Lewis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the given information, only statement 5 can be definitively concluded as true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively). This means D, H, M form a partition of the universe.\n2.  There's at least one of each (D, H, M are non-empty).\n3.  A donkey saw every donkey. Let's call this donkey 'D_seer'. So, D_seer $\\in$ D, and for all d $\\in$ D, D_seer saw d.\n4.  No donkeys saw Lewis. This means for any d $\\in$ D, d did not see Lewis.\n5.  No donkeys saw Hazel. This means for any d $\\in$ D, d did not see Hazel.\n6.  A human saw Alfred just in case every monkey chased Hazel. Let 'H_saw_A' be the proposition \"A human saw Alfred\" and 'M_chased_H' be the proposition \"Every monkey chased Hazel\". So, H_saw_A $\\iff$ M_chased_H.\n\n**Analysis of Statements:**\n\n**From Condition 3 and 4:**\n*   Condition 3: A donkey (let's call it D_x) saw *every* donkey. So, D_x saw D_x.\n*   Condition 4: No donkeys saw Lewis.\n*   If Lewis were a donkey (Lewis $\\in$ D), then D_x (the donkey that saw every donkey) would have seen Lewis.\n*   But Condition 4 states that no donkeys saw Lewis.\n*   This creates a contradiction if Lewis is a donkey. Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey.\n\n**From Condition 3 and 5:**\n*   Condition 3: A donkey (D_x) saw *every* donkey. So, D_x saw D_x.\n*   Condition 5: No donkeys saw Hazel.\n*   If Hazel were a donkey (Hazel $\\in$ D), then D_x (the donkey that saw every donkey) would have seen Hazel.\n*   But Condition 5 states that no donkeys saw Hazel.\n*   This creates a contradiction if Hazel is a donkey. Therefore, Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n1.  **Lewis is a donkey.**\n    *   Based on our analysis above, if Lewis were a donkey, then the donkey that saw every donkey (from condition 3) would have seen Lewis. But condition 4 states no donkeys saw Lewis. This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n2.  **Alfred isn't a donkey.**\n    *   We have no direct information about Alfred's species from conditions 1-5 that forces him to be or not be a donkey.\n    *   Condition 6 relates a human seeing Alfred to monkeys chasing Hazel. This doesn't restrict Alfred's species.\n    *   For example, if Alfred is a human, the statement \"Alfred isn't a donkey\" is true. If Alfred is a monkey, the statement \"Alfred isn't a donkey\" is true. If Alfred is a donkey, the statement \"Alfred isn't a donkey\" is false.\n    *   There's nothing in the premises that forces Alfred to be or not be a donkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **is not necessarily true**.\n\n3.  **Alfred is a donkey.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, there's no information that forces Alfred to be a donkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **is not necessarily true**.\n\n4.  **Hazel is a donkey.**\n    *   Based on our analysis above, if Hazel were a donkey, then the donkey that saw every donkey (from condition 3) would have seen Hazel.

This tells us *a human* will attack, not necessarily Alfred. We don't know if Alfred is a human, a donkey, or a monkey, or if he attacks.\n*   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred saw every human.**\n*   We know \"Every human saw Alfred\" from (5). This is the inverse of \"Alfred saw every human.\" Just because every human saw Alfred doesn't mean Alfred saw every human. Consider a celebrity (Alfred) being seen by many fans (humans); the celebrity doesn't necessarily see all the fans.\n*   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 3: A human saw Alfred.**\n*   From (5), we are explicitly told: \"Every human saw Alfred.\" If *every* human saw Alfred, then it logically follows that *at least one* human saw Alfred. The existence of humans is guaranteed by (2).\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred saw a human.**\n*   Similar to Statement 2, we only know that humans saw Alfred, not the other way around. Alfred might be blind, or simply not have seen any humans.\n*   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 5: Not all humans saw Alfred.**\n*   From (5), we are explicitly told: \"Every human saw Alfred.\" This directly contradicts \"Not all humans saw Alfred.\"\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Statement 6: No humans saw Alfred.**\n*   From (5), we are explicitly told: \"Every human saw Alfred.\" This directly contradicts \"No humans saw Alfred.\"\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information provided, only statement 3 is necessarily true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

(This statement seems to be a distractor for the donkey/human chasing logic).\n\n**Analyzing the Donkey Chasing Rules:**\n\nLet's focus on rules 3 and 4 concerning donkeys.\n\n*   **Rule 3:** $\\forall d_1 \\in D \\exists d_2 \\in D (d_2 \\text{ did not chase } d_1)$.\n    *   This implies that no single donkey was chased by *all* donkeys.\n\n*   **Rule 4:** $\\forall d_1 \\in D, \\forall d_2 \\in D ((\\forall h \\in H, C(d_2, h)) \\implies C(d_1, d_2))$.\n    *   If there exists a donkey $d_2$ that chased every human, then *every* donkey $d_1$ chased $d_2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two rules together.\n\nSuppose there *does* exist a donkey $d_X$ such that $d_X$ chased every human ($\\forall h \\in H, C(d_X, h)$).\nAccording to Rule 4, if such a $d_X$ exists, then *every* donkey $d_1$ must have chased $d_X$ ($\\forall d_1 \\in D, C(d_1, d_X)$).\n\nHowever, this conclusion ($\\forall d_1 \\in D, C(d_1, d_X)$) directly contradicts Rule 3, which states that for any donkey $d_1$, there must be *some* donkey $d_2$ that did not chase $d_1$. Specifically, Rule 3 says: \"There is not a donkey that every donkey chased.\" If $d_X$ were chased by every donkey, it would violate Rule 3.\n\nTherefore, our initial supposition must be false. It must be the case that there does *not* exist a donkey that chased every human.\n\nIn logical terms:\nLet $P(d)$ be the predicate \"d chased every human\" ($\\forall h \\in H, C(d, h)$).\nRule 4: $\\forall d_1 \\in D, \\forall d_2 \\in D (P(d_2) \\implies C(d_1, d_2))$.\nRule 3: $\\neg \\exists d_X \\in D \\forall d_Y \\in D (C(d_Y, d_X))$.\n\nAssume $\\exists d_X \\in D (P(d_X))$.\nThen by Rule 4, $\\forall d_Y \\in D (C(d_Y, d_X))$.\nThis contradicts Rule 3.\nTherefore, the assumption must be false.\nSo, $\\neg \\exists d_X \\in D (P(d_X))$.\nThis means: $\\forall d \\in D \\neg (\\forall h \\in H, C(d, h))$.\nWhich simplifies to: $\\forall d \\in D \\exists h \\in H (\\neg C(d, h))$.\n\nThis means \"For every donkey, there is at least one human that it did not chase.\"\nOr, equivalently, \"No donkey chased every human.\"\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n1.  **A donkey chased every human.** ($\\exists d \\in D \\forall h \\in H, C(d, h)$)\n    *   This is the direct opposite of what we deduced. So, this must be **false**.\n\n2.  **Every donkey chased a human.** ($\\forall d \\in D \\exists h \\in H, C(d, h)$)\n    *   Our deduction was $\\forall d \\in D \\exists h \\in H (\\neg C(d, h))$. This means for every donkey, there's at least one human it *didn't* chase. This statement says for every donkey, there's at least one human it *did* chase. These two statements are not mutually exclusive. For example, a donkey could chase human A but not human B.\n    *   The given information does not provide enough to confirm or deny this. We only know that no donkey chased *all* humans. It's possible a donkey chased no humans, or some humans, or all but one human. We cannot determine this.\n\n3.  **A donkey chased a human.** ($\\exists d \\in D \\exists h \\in H, C(d, h)$)\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we don't have information to confirm this. It's possible that no donkey chased any human. We only know that no donkey chased *every* human.\n\n4.  **No donkeys chased a human.** ($\\forall d \\in D \\forall h \\in H, \\neg C(d, h)$)\n    *   This is the opposite of statement 3. We cannot determine this.\n\n5.  **No donkeys chased every human.** ($\\forall d \\in D \\neg (\\forall h \\in H, C(d, h))$ or $\\forall d \\in D \\exists h \\in H (\\neg C(d, h))$)\n    *   This is precisely what we deduced from the combination of Rule 3 and Rule 4. This must be **true**.\n\n6.  **Every donkey chased every human.** ($\\forall d \\in D \\forall h \\in H, C(d, h)$)\n    *   This is a stronger version of statement 1, which we already determined to be false. If no *single* donkey chased every human, then certainly *every* donkey didn't chase every human. This must be **false**.\n\nTherefore, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

The statements are about donkeys chasing monkeys. These are different actions.\n*   Just because A chased B, it doesn't mean B chased A. So, Premise 1 *alone* does not directly imply any of the statements 1-6.\n\n**Let's re-examine the problem for any hidden implications or common logical pitfalls.**\n\nThe problem states \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\" This is crucial for existence.\n\nLet's look at the statements again in light of the premises.\n\n**Premise 1: Every monkey chased every donkey.**\n*   This means: M x D -> Chased (where M is the set of monkeys, D is the set of donkeys).\n*   This is a strong statement about the actions of monkeys towards donkeys.\n\n**Let's consider the contrapositive or implications of the other premises.**\n\n**Premise 4: Not all humans kicked Alfred just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.**\n*   (\u2203h' \u2208 H, h' did not kick Alfred) \u21d4 (\u2200m \u2208 M, m did not see Lewis)\n*   This means:\n    *   If some human did not kick Alfred, then no monkey saw Lewis.\n    *   If no monkey saw Lewis, then some human did not kick Alfred.\n*   And also:\n    *   If all humans kicked Alfred, then some monkey saw Lewis.\n    *   If some monkey saw Lewis, then all humans kicked Alfred.\n\n**Premise 3: A monkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n*   (\u2203m \u2208 M, m kicked Lewis) OR (\u2203m' \u2208 M, m' did not see Hazel)\n*   This is a disjunction. At least one of these must be true.\n\n**Premise 2: A monkey saw a human that saw a monkey.**\n*   \u2203m1 \u2208 M, \u2203h \u2208 H, \u2203m2 \u2208 M such that (m1 saw h) AND (h saw m2)\n*   This confirms the existence of at least two monkeys and at least one human involved in a specific chain of seeing.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement.\n\n**Statement 1: Every donkey chased every monkey.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200m \u2208 M, d chased m)\n*   Does Premise 1 (Every monkey chased every donkey) imply this? No. Chasing is not necessarily reciprocal.\n*   Do any other premises imply this? No direct connection.\n*   Could it be false? Yes. It's perfectly possible that donkeys never chased monkeys, or only some did.\n\n**Statement 2: A monkey chased every donkey.** (\u2203m \u2208 M, \u2200d \u2208 D, m chased d)\n*   This is *exactly* what Premise 1 states: \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\"\n*   If *every* monkey chased *every* donkey, then it is certainly true that *a* monkey (any monkey, in fact) chased *every* donkey.\n*   Let's rephrase Premise 1: For every monkey $m_i$, and for every donkey $d_j$, $m_i$ chased $d_j$.\n*   This means if you pick any specific monkey, say $m_k$, then $m_k$ chased $d_1$, $m_k$ chased $d_2$, ..., $m_k$ chased $d_n$ (for all donkeys).\n*   Therefore, \"A monkey chased every donkey\" is a direct consequence of \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\"\n\nLet's double check this.\nPremise 1: $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, \\text{Chased}(m, d)$\nStatement 2: $\\exists m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, \\text{Chased}(m, d)$\n\nIf Premise 1 is true, then for any arbitrary $m_0 \\in M$ (and we know M is not empty), it is true that $\\forall d \\in D, \\text{Chased}(m_0, d)$.\nSince such an $m_0$ exists, then $\\exists m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, \\text{Chased}(m, d)$ is true.\nSo, Statement 2 *must* be true.\n\n---\n\nLet's quickly check the others to be sure.\n\n**Statement 3: Every donkey chased a monkey.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203m \u2208 M, d chased m)\n*   Does Premise 1 imply this? No. Premise 1 is about monkeys chasing donkeys.\n*   Could it be false? Yes. It's possible that no donkey ever chased any monkey.\n\n**Statement 4: A donkey chased every monkey.** (\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2200m \u2208 M, d chased m)\n*   Does Premise 1 imply this? No.\n*   Could it be false? Yes.\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey chased a monkey.** (\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2203m \u2208 M, d chased m)\n*   Does Premise 1 imply this? No.\n*   Could it be false? Yes. It's possible that no donkey ever chased any monkey.\n\n**Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203m \u2208 M, d did not chase m)\n*   This is the negation of Statement 4.\n*   Since Statement 4 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either. It could be true or false depending on the specific actions of donkeys.\n\n---\n\nThe key insight here is the relationship between \"Every X did Y to every Z\" and \"An X did Y to every Z\".\nIf *every single* X performed the action Y on *every single* Z, then it logically follows that *at least one* X (in fact, any X you pick) performed the action Y on *every single* Z.\n\nThe other premises (2, 3, 4) introduce complexities about seeing and kicking, but they do not provide any information that would force donkeys to chase monkeys, or vice-versa, beyond what is explicitly stated in Premise 1. Premise 1 is the only one that describes chasing behavior.\n\nTherefore, only Statement 2 is a direct logical consequence of Premise 1.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(For every d in D, there exists an m in M such that d saw m).\n4.  **Human-Human-Donkey Sightings:** A human saw a human that saw a donkey. (There exists h1 in H, h2 in H, d in D such that h1 saw h2 and h2 saw d).\n5.  **Hazel's Nature:** Hazel is a human (from \"Hazel saw a human\" and the exclusive categories).\n6.  **Hazel-Alfred Chasing:** Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n7.  **Lewis-Alfred Sightings:** It is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.

No.\n    Example: Donkey A saw Monkey X. Donkey B saw Monkey Y. If there are only Monkeys X and Y, then Donkey A didn't see Monkey Y, and Donkey B didn't see Monkey X. So, no single donkey saw *every* monkey.\n    Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **No donkeys saw a monkey.**\n    This means: For every $d \\in D$, for every $m \\in M$, $d$ did not see $m$.\n    This directly contradicts the given information: \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\"\n    Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3.  **There is a donkey that every monkey saw.**\n    This means: There exists a $d \\in D$ such that for every $m \\in M$, $m$ saw $d$.\n    The given information is about donkeys seeing monkeys, not monkeys seeing donkeys. There's no information to support this.\n    Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **A donkey saw a monkey.**\n    This means: There exists a $d \\in D$ and there exists an $m \\in M$ such that $d$ saw $m$.\n    The given information states: \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\" If *every* donkey saw *a* monkey, then it logically follows that *at least one* donkey saw *at least one* monkey. If there's at least one donkey (which is given), then this statement must be true.\n    Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5.  **Every donkey saw every monkey.**\n    This means: For every $d \\in D$, for every $m \\in M$, $d$ saw $m$.\n    Does \"Every donkey saw a monkey\" imply this? No.\n    Example: Donkey A saw Monkey X. Donkey B saw Monkey Y. If there are only Monkeys X and Y, and Donkey A did not see Monkey Y, then it's not true that Donkey A saw *every* monkey.\n    Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **No donkeys saw every monkey.**\n    This means: For every $d \\in D$, there exists an $m \\in M$ such that $d$ did not see $m$.\n    This is the negation of statement 1. If statement 1 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either. We don't have enough information to confirm this. It's possible that there's only one monkey, in which case every donkey *would* have seen every monkey (because \"every monkey\" would just be that one monkey).\n    Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given statements and deduce what must be true.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n    *   This means the set of all things is partitioned into three non-empty sets: Donkeys (D), Humans (H), Monkeys (M).\n    *   $D \\neq \\emptyset$, $H \\neq \\emptyset$, $M \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n2.  **Alfred isn't a human unless no donkeys are happy.**\n    *   Let A = Alfred.\n    *   Let H(x) = x is a human.\n    *   Let DH = Donkeys are happy.\n    *   The statement is: $\\neg H(A) \\lor \\neg DH$. (If Alfred is a human, then no donkeys are happy).\n    *   This can also be written as: $H(A) \\implies \\neg DH$.\n\n3.  **Only humans will run and a human will attack.**\n    *   Let R(x) = x will run.\n    *   Let At(x) = x will attack.\n    *   \"Only humans will run\" means: $\\forall x (R(x) \\implies H(x))$. (If something runs, it must be a human).\n    *   \"a human will attack\" means: $\\exists x (H(x) \\land At(x))$.\n\n4.  **Not all humans will run and every monkey chased Alfred.**\n    *   \"Not all humans will run\" means: $\\neg (\\forall x (H(x) \\implies R(x)))$. This is equivalent to $\\exists x (H(x) \\land \\neg R(x))$. (There is at least one human who will not run).\n    *   \"every monkey chased Alfred\" means: $\\forall x (M(x) \\implies \\text{chased}(x, A))$. This statement doesn't seem to directly impact the running/human logic, but it's part of the given facts.\n\n**Analyzing the \"Running\" Statements:**\n\nFrom statement 3:\n*   \"Only humans will run\": $\\forall x (R(x) \\implies H(x))$. This implies that if something runs, it *must* be a human. It also implies that donkeys and monkeys cannot run.\n\nFrom statement 4:\n*   \"Not all humans will run\": $\\exists x (H(x) \\land \\neg R(x))$. This means there is at least one human who *will not* run.\n\nNow let's combine these two:\n\n*   We know that if anything runs, it's a human.\n*   We know that there's at least one human who doesn't run.\n\nConsider the implications for humans running:\n\n*   Can *no* humans run? If no humans run, then $\\forall x (H(x) \\implies \\neg R(x))$. This is consistent with \"Not all humans will run\" (because if none run, then certainly not all run). It is also consistent with \"Only humans will run\" (because if nothing runs, then anything that runs is vacuously a human). So, \"No humans will run\" is a *possibility*.\n\n*   Can *some* humans run? Let's say there's a human $h_1$ who runs ($R(h_1)$). This is consistent with \"Only humans will run\" (since $h_1$ is a human). We also need \"Not all humans will run\", which means there must be another human $h_2$ who does not run ($\\neg R(h_2)$). This is also possible, as long as there are at least two humans, or one human who runs and one who doesn't. Since we know there's at least one human, and \"not all humans will run\" implies there's at least one human who doesn't run, it's possible that some humans run and some don't.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the options based on the combined information about running:**\n\n*   **\"Only humans will run\"** ($\\forall x (R(x) \\implies H(x))$) is explicitly stated.\n*   **\"Not all humans will run\"** ($\\exists x (H(x) \\land \\neg R(x))$) is explicitly stated.\n\nNow let's look at the given options:\n\n1.  **Not all humans will run and no humans will run.**\n    *   \"Not all humans will run\" is true.\n    *   \"No humans will run\" means $\\forall x (H(x) \\implies \\neg R(x))$.\n    *   If \"No humans will run\" is true, then \"Not all humans will run\" is also true. So this statement simplifies to \"No humans will run\".\n    *   Is \"No humans will run\" *necessarily* true? No. It's possible that some humans run, as long as not *all* of them do. For example, if Human A runs and Human B doesn't, then \"Only humans will run\" is true, and \"Not all humans will run\" is true, but \"No humans will run\" is false. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **No humans will run.**\n    *   As discussed above, this is not necessarily true. It's possible that some humans run.\n\n3.  **Only humans will run and no humans will run.**\n    *   \"Only humans will run\" is true.\n    *   \"No humans will run\" is not necessarily true.\n    *   Therefore, the conjunction is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **Only humans will run and not all humans will run.**\n    *   \"Only humans will run\" is explicitly stated as true (from statement 3).\n    *   \"Not all humans will run\" is explicitly stated as true (from statement 4).\n    *   Since both conjuncts are explicitly stated as true, their conjunction *must* be true.\n\n5.  **A human will run.**\n    *   This means $\\exists x (H(x) \\land R(x))$.\n    *   Is this necessarily true?\n    *   We know \"Only humans will run\" and \"Not all humans will run\".\n    *   If \"A human will run\" were false, then \"No humans will run\" would be true ($\\forall x (H(x) \\implies \\neg R(x))$).\n    *   If \"No humans will run\" is true, then \"Not all humans will run\" is also true (because if none run, then it's certainly not the case that all run).\n    *   And \"Only humans will run\" is also true (vacuously, if nothing runs, then anything that runs is a human).\n    *   So, it is *possible* that no humans run. Therefore, \"A human will run\" is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **Every human will run.**\n    *   This means $\\forall x (H(x) \\implies R(x))$.\n    *   This directly contradicts the given statement \"Not all humans will run\" ($\\neg (\\forall x (H(x) \\implies R(x)))$).\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is the one that combines two explicitly given facts.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(This implies there's at least one human who *didn't* kick Hazel, or perhaps no humans kicked Hazel at all).\n*   **Alfred & Donkeys:** Alfred chased every donkey.\n*   **Donkeys & Alfred:** Not all donkeys chased Alfred. (This implies there's at least one donkey that *didn't* chase Alfred).\n*   **Hazel's State:** Hazel isn't asleep.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\n1.  **Alfred is asleep.**\n    *   We have no information about Alfred's sleep status. This statement cannot be confirmed or denied.\n\n2.  **No donkeys chased Alfred.**\n    *   We are told \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\" This means there is *at least one* donkey that did *not* chase Alfred. However, it doesn't mean *no* donkeys chased Alfred. It's possible some did and some didn't. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Alfred chased a donkey.**\n    *   We are told \"Alfred chased every donkey.\"\n    *   We are also told \"there's at least one of each\" (including donkeys).\n    *   Since there is at least one donkey, and Alfred chased *every* donkey, it logically follows that Alfred must have chased at least one donkey. This statement **must be true**.\n\n4.  **A donkey chased Alfred.**\n    *   We are told \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\" This means there's at least one donkey that *didn't* chase Alfred.\n    *   However, this doesn't tell us if *any* donkey *did* chase Alfred. It's possible that some did and some didn't, or it's possible that none did. We cannot conclude that at least one donkey chased Alfred.

(This statement seems to be a distractor for the core question about monkey-kicking relationships, as it introduces \"Hazel\" and \"hungry\" which are not directly related to the kicking dynamics among monkeys themselves, except for the \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" part, which is a condition, not a direct consequence of the monkey-kicking rule).\n\n**Focus on the Monkey-Kicking Rule:**\n\nThe crucial rule is: **\"Every monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it.\"**\n\nLet's denote the set of all monkeys as M.\nLet 'kicked(A, B)' mean A kicked B.\n\nThe rule can be rephrased: For any monkey $m_1 \\in M$ and any monkey $m_2 \\in M$, if $m_2$ kicked $m_1$, then $m_1$ kicked $m_2$.\nThis implies a symmetric relationship for kicking *among monkeys*. If monkey A kicked monkey B, then monkey B must have kicked monkey A.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n**1. A monkey kicked a monkey.**\n*   We know \"A monkey kicked Alfred.\" This tells us there's at least one monkey. Let's call this monkey M1.\n*   The rule \"Every monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it\" applies to *all* monkeys.\n*   Consider the simplest case: there is only one monkey, M1. Can M1 kick M1? The rule says \"Every monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it.\" If M1 kicked M1, then M1 must have kicked M1. This is consistent.\n*   If there are two monkeys, M1 and M2. If M1 kicked M2, then M2 must have kicked M1. This means there was a monkey (M1) that kicked a monkey (M2).\n*   Since there is at least one monkey, and the rule describes a relationship *among* monkeys, it's highly probable this is true. If there's only one monkey, and it kicks itself, then \"a monkey kicked a monkey\" is true. If there are multiple monkeys, and any one of them kicks another, or itself, it's true. The rule implies a reciprocal kicking. It doesn't explicitly state that any monkey *must* kick another monkey, or itself. However, the phrasing \"Every monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it\" implies that if such a kicking event *occurs* between monkeys, it must be reciprocal. It doesn't guarantee that any monkey *does* kick another monkey.\n*   Let's re-evaluate. The rule is a conditional statement: IF X kicked Y, THEN Y kicked X. It doesn't state that any X *must* kick any Y. So, it's possible that no monkey kicked any other monkey (or itself). If no monkey kicked any monkey, then \"A monkey kicked a monkey\" would be false. The problem states \"A monkey kicked Alfred,\" but Alfred is not necessarily a monkey. So, we cannot infer that a monkey kicked a monkey from the given information.\n\n**2. A monkey kicked every monkey.**\n*   This means there exists at least one monkey (let's call it M_kicker) such that M_kicker kicked every monkey in the set M.\n*   The rule \"Every monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it\" means if M_kicker kicked M_x, then M_x kicked M_kicker.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true. We have no information that guarantees such a \"universal kicker\" monkey exists.\n\n**3. A monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it.**\n*   This statement is a direct rephrasing of the given rule: \"Every monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it.\"\n*   The rule is stated as a universal truth about monkeys in this situation.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**4. Every monkey kicked a monkey.**\n*   This means for every monkey M_x, there exists at least one monkey M_y (which could be M_x itself) such that M_x kicked M_y.\n*   Similar to statement 1, the given rule is conditional. It doesn't force any monkey to kick another. It only describes the nature of the kicking relationship *if* it occurs.\n*   It's possible that no monkey kicked any other monkey (or itself). If this were the case, then \"Every monkey kicked a monkey\" would be false.\n\n**5. No monkeys kicked every monkey.**\n*   This is the negation of statement 2.\n*   Since statement 2 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either. It's possible that one monkey *did* kick every other monkey (and itself), or it's possible that no monkey did. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this.\n\n**6. Every monkey kicked every monkey.**\n*   This means for every monkey M_x and every monkey M_y (including M_x = M_y), M_x kicked M_y.\n*   If this were true, then the rule \"Every monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it\" would be satisfied (because if M_x kicked M_y, then M_y also kicked M_x).\n*   However, the rule itself does not *force* every monkey to kick every other monkey. It only describes the reciprocity if kicking occurs. It's possible that no kicking occurs between monkeys, or only some kicking occurs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is the one that directly restates the given rule about monkey-kicking relationships.\n\nFinal Answer: The statement that must be true is **3. A monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it.**",

If no humans will run, then it's automatically true that not all humans will run (because zero humans will run, which is less than all humans).\n    *   Therefore, the combined statement \"Not all humans will run and no humans will run\" implies that **no humans will run**. This is a crucial deduction.\n\n**Deductions from Given Information:**\n\n*   **Deduction 1: No humans will run.** (From point 5)\n\n*   **Deduction 2: Alfred's Action (Revisited).** We are told \"Alfred will run.\" (From point 3)\n    *   If Alfred will run, and no humans will run (Deduction 1), then **Alfred cannot be a human**.\n\n*   **Deduction 3: Alfred's Sight Condition (Revisited).**\n    *   \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel.\"\n    *   Can Alfred \"not see Alfred\"? This is a self-referential and somewhat nonsensical statement in a literal sense. However, in logical puzzles, such statements often imply a contradiction or a specific state.\n    *   If \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is interpreted as a state that *cannot* be true (i.e., Alfred always sees Alfred, or the premise is impossible), then the implication's antecedent is false, making the entire conditional statement vacuously true.\n    *   Let's assume \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is a condition that *could* logically occur, perhaps implying a state of confusion or non-existence.\n    *   However, the more common interpretation of \"X doesn't see X\" in these puzzles is that it's a statement that is inherently false or contradictory. If Alfred exists, Alfred \"sees\" Alfred in the sense of being aware of himself.\n    *   If \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is *false*, then the implication \"False $\\implies$ (A human chased Hazel)\" is true regardless of whether a human chased Hazel. This doesn't help us much.\n\n    *   Let's consider the contrapositive: \"(A human did not chase Hazel) $\\implies$ (Alfred sees Alfred)\".\n    *   What if \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is meant to be a condition that *must* be true for the implication to be meaningful? This seems unlikely.\n\n    *   Let's re-evaluate \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel.\"\n        *   This means: If Alfred doesn't see Alfred, then a human chased Hazel.\n        *   Is it possible for Alfred to not see Alfred? This is the key.\n        *   If Alfred is a normal entity, then \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is a self-contradictory statement. If it's self-contradictory, it's false.\n        *   If the antecedent of an \"only if\" statement is false, the entire statement is true. So, if \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is false, then the statement \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel\" is true, regardless of whether a human chased Hazel. This doesn't give us information about Hazel or the chasing.\n\n    *   Let's consider an alternative interpretation: Perhaps \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is a *metaphorical* statement, or it's a condition that *could* be true in some abstract sense. However, without further context, the most straightforward interpretation is that it's a self-contradiction.\n\n    *   **Crucial Re-evaluation of \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\":** This phrase is highly unusual. If it means Alfred is literally blind to himself, or non-existent, it changes the nature of Alfred. Given the other statements, it's more likely a trick.\n        *   If Alfred *exists*, then Alfred *sees* Alfred (in the sense of being self-aware). So, \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is **false**.\n        *   If the antecedent of an \"only if\" statement (P only if Q means P implies Q) is false, the entire statement is true. So, \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel\" is true, but it tells us nothing about whether a human chased Hazel.\n\n    *   **Let's assume for a moment that \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is a state that *can* be true, and it's relevant.** If it *is* true, then a human chased Hazel. But we have no information to confirm or deny \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred.\"\n\n    *   **Let's stick to the most logical interpretation:** \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is a self-contradiction, hence false. Therefore, the conditional statement is true, but it doesn't provide information about the consequence.\n\n    *   **What if the statement is meant to imply something about Alfred's nature?** If Alfred *cannot* see Alfred, perhaps Alfred is not a normal being. But the categories are donkey, human, monkey.\n\n    *   **Let's reconsider the possibility that \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is *intended* to be true for some reason.** If it *is* true, then \"a human chased Hazel\" must be true.\n        *   If \"a human chased Hazel\" is true, then at least one human exists (which we know).\n        *   However, we have no basis to assume \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is true.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Alfred's Sight:** This statement seems to be a distractor or a red herring, as its antecedent is likely false, making the implication vacuously true and providing no further information about Hazel or the chasing. We cannot deduce anything about Hazel from this.\n\n**Summary of Strong Deductions:**\n\n*   Alfred will run.\n*   No humans will run.\n*   Therefore, Alfred is not a human.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n1.  **Alfred is a human.**\n    *   False. We deduced that Alfred is not a human because Alfred will run, and no humans will run.\n\n2.  **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n    *   We know Alfred will run.\n    *   We have no information about whether Hazel will run. The \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" statement was a dead end for deducing anything about Hazel.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot confirm this.\n\n3.  **Alfred won't run.**\n    *   False. The problem explicitly states \"Alfred will run.\"\n\n4.  **Hazel and Alfred will run.**\n    *   Same as statement 2. We know Alfred will run, but we don't know about Hazel.\n\n5.  **Hazel will run.**\n    *   We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n\n6.  **Alfred isn't a human.**\n    *   True. We deduced this because Alfred will run, and no humans will run.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\" - This sets up the categories.\n*   \"Alfred will run.\" - Confirmed.\n*   \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel.\" - As discussed, the antecedent \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is likely false (self-contradictory for an existing being), making the implication true but uninformative about the consequent. If it were true, it would mean a human chased Hazel, but we have no reason to believe it's true.\n*   \"Not all humans will run and no humans will run.\" - This definitively means \"no humans will run.\"\n\nSince Alfred will run, and no humans will run, Alfred cannot be a human.\n\nTherefore, statement 6 is the only one that must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze each statement.\n\n**Definitions:**\n*   **D:** Set of donkeys\n*   **H:** Set of humans\n*   **M:** Set of monkeys\n*   These three sets are exclusive and cover everything.\n*   There is at least one of each (D, H, M are non-empty).\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Not all monkeys chased Hazel.** (Hazel is presumably a human or a donkey or a monkey, but her identity isn't crucial beyond this statement.) This means there exists at least one monkey, let's call it $m_1 \\in M$, such that $m_1$ did not chase Hazel.\n2.  **Every monkey chased a donkey.** This can be written as: $\\forall m \\in M, \\exists d \\in D \\text{ such that } m \\text{ chased } d$.\n3.  **Every monkey chased every donkey that chased every human.** This is the most complex statement. Let's break it down:\n    *   Let $D_{chase\\_all\\_H}$ be the set of donkeys that chased every human. So, $d \\in D_{chase\\_all\\_H} \\iff \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ chased } h$.\n    *   The statement then becomes: $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d' \\in D_{chase\\_all\\_H}, m \\text{ chased } d'$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to be Evaluated:**\n\nLet's go through each statement and determine if it *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 1: Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n*   This means: $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, d \\text{ chased } m$.\n*   Consider a scenario: There's one donkey, $d_1$, and one monkey, $m_1$. $d_1$ chased $m_1$. This satisfies the statement.\n*   Now consider a scenario where $d_1$ exists, and $m_1$ exists, but $d_1$ did *not* chase $m_1$. This would make the statement false.\n*   Do the given conditions force $d_1$ to chase $m_1$?\n    *   Condition 2 says $m_1$ chased *a* donkey. It doesn't say a donkey chased $m_1$.\n    *   Condition 3 talks about monkeys chasing donkeys, not the other way around.\n*   There's no information that forces donkeys to chase monkeys.\n*   **Conclusion: Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Statement 2: Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n*   This means: $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists m \\in M \\text{ such that } d \\text{ chased } m$.\n*   Similar to Statement 1, the given conditions describe monkeys chasing donkeys, not donkeys chasing monkeys. We can easily construct a scenario where a donkey exists but doesn't chase any monkey.\n*   **Conclusion: Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Statement 3: A monkey chased a donkey.**\n*   This means: $\\exists m \\in M, \\exists d \\in D \\text{ such that } m \\text{ chased } d$.\n*   Look at **Given Information 2: Every monkey chased a donkey.**\n*   Since there is at least one monkey (M is non-empty), let $m_1$ be a monkey.\n*   According to Given Information 2, $m_1$ must have chased *a* donkey.\n*   Therefore, there exists a monkey ($m_1$) and there exists a donkey (the one $m_1$ chased) such that the monkey chased the donkey.\n*   **Conclusion: Must be true.**\n\n**Statement 4: No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n*   This means: $\\neg (\\exists d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, d \\text{ chased } m)$.\n*   Which is equivalent to: $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists m \\in M \\text{ such that } d \\text{ did not chase } m$.\n*   This is the negation of Statement 5. If Statement 5 is true, this is false. If Statement 5 is false, this could be true.\n*   As established with Statement 1 and 2, we have no information about donkeys chasing monkeys. It's possible for a donkey to chase every monkey, or for no donkey to chase every monkey.\n*   Consider a scenario with one donkey $d_1$ and one monkey $m_1$. If $d_1$ chased $m_1$, then $d_1$ chased *every* monkey. In this case, Statement 4 would be false.\n*   Consider a scenario with one donkey $d_1$ and two monkeys $m_1, m_2$. If $d_1$ chased $m_1$ but not $m_2$, then $d_1$ did not chase *every* monkey. In this case, Statement 4 would be true.\n*   Since we can construct scenarios where it's true and where it's false, it's not necessarily true.\n*   **Conclusion: Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey chased every monkey.**\n*   This means: $\\exists d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, d \\text{ chased } m$.\n*   Similar to Statement 1 and 2, the given information does not provide any basis for donkeys chasing monkeys, let alone a specific donkey chasing *every* monkey. We can easily construct a scenario where no donkey chased every monkey (e.g., multiple donkeys, each chasing a different subset of monkeys, or no donkeys chasing any monkeys).\n*   **Conclusion: Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Statement 6: A donkey chased a monkey.**\n*   This means: $\\exists d \\in D, \\exists m \\in M \\text{ such that } d \\text{ chased } m$.\n*   This is the existential version of donkeys chasing monkeys.\n*   Again, the given information only describes monkeys chasing donkeys. There's no rule that forces any donkey to chase any monkey.\n*   We can have a situation where:\n    *   Monkeys $m_1, m_2$ exist.\n    *   Donkeys $d_1, d_2$ exist.\n    *   $m_1$ chased $d_1$.\n    *   $m_2$ chased $d_2$.\n    *   No donkey chased any monkey.\n    *   This scenario is consistent with all given information.\n*   **Conclusion: Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Final Check:**\nOnly Statement 3 was derived directly from the given information and the existence of at least one monkey.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

($\\exists d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ saw } h$)\n4.  **Human Chase Lewis (Conditional):** Not all humans chased Lewis OR Lewis is a donkey. ($\\neg (\\forall h \\in H, h \\to L) \\lor (L \\in D)$)\n    *   This is equivalent to: ($\\exists h \\in H, h \\not\\to L) \\lor (L \\in D)$\n5.  **Monkey Eating (Conditional):** Not all monkeys ate just in case every donkey chased Lewis.\n    *   Let A be \"all monkeys ate\" and B be \"every donkey chased Lewis\".\n    *   The statement is $\\neg (A \\leftrightarrow B)$.\n    *   This means $(A \\land \\neg B) \\lor (\\neg A \\land B)$.\n    *   So, (all monkeys ate AND not every donkey chased Lewis) OR (not all monkeys ate AND every donkey chased Lewis).\n6.  **Human Saw Lewis & Lewis's Type:** A human saw Lewis BUT it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n    *   ($\\exists h \\in H, h \\text{ saw } L$) AND ($L \\notin D$)\n\n**Deductions from Given Information:**\n\nFrom (6), we know:\n*   Lewis is not a donkey ($L \\notin D$).\n*   Since Lewis is not a donkey, and everything is a donkey, human, or monkey, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey ($L \\in H \\lor L \\in M$).\n\nNow let's use this deduction with (4):\n*   (4) is: ($\\exists h \\in H, h \\not\\to L) \\lor (L \\in D)$.\n*   Since we know $L \\notin D$, the second part of the disjunction is false.\n*   Therefore, the first part must be true: $\\exists h \\in H, h \\not\\to L$.\n*   This means **Not all humans chased Lewis**.\n\nLet's check the options based on this deduction:\n\n*   **1. A human chased Lewis.** (Cannot be determined. We only know *not all* did.)\n*   **2. Lewis chased a human.** (Cannot be determined.)\n*   **3. No humans chased Lewis.** (This would mean $\\forall h \\in H, h \\not\\to L$. We only know $\\exists h \\in H, h \\not\\to L$, which is \"not all humans chased Lewis\". It's possible some did and some didn't.)\n*   **4. Lewis chased every human.** (Cannot be determined.)\n*   **5. Every human chased Lewis.** (This is $\\forall h \\in H, h \\to L$. We deduced $\\neg (\\forall h \\in H, h \\to L)$, so this statement is **false**.)\n*   **6. Not all humans chased Lewis.** (This is exactly what we deduced: $\\exists h \\in H, h \\not\\to L$.)\n\nTherefore, statement 6 must be true.\n\nLet's re-verify everything.\n\nFrom (6):\n*   Lewis is not a donkey ($L \\notin D$).\n*   A human saw Lewis ($\\exists h \\in H, h \\text{ saw } L$).\n\nFrom (4): \"Not all humans chased Lewis OR Lewis is a donkey.\"\n*   Symbolically: $(\\neg \\forall h \\in H, h \\to L) \\lor (L \\in D)$.\n*   Since $L \\notin D$ (from 6), the second part of the disjunction is false.\n*   For the disjunction to be true, the first part must be true: $\\neg \\forall h \\in H, h \\to L$.\n*   This means \"It is not the case that every human chased Lewis,\" which is equivalent to \"Not all humans chased Lewis.\"\n\nThis directly matches option 6.\n\nLet's consider if any other options *could* be true or false.\n\n*   **1. A human chased Lewis.** Could be true (some did, some didn't) or false (no humans chased Lewis). We only know *not all* did.\n*   **2. Lewis chased a human.** We don't have information about Lewis chasing humans.\n*   **3. No humans chased Lewis.** This means $\\forall h \\in H, h \\not\\to L$. This is consistent with \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" (if no humans chased Lewis, then certainly not all of them did). However, \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" also allows for the possibility that *some* humans chased Lewis, but not *all*. So, \"No humans chased Lewis\" is not *necessarily* true.\n*   **4. Lewis chased every human.** We don't have information about Lewis chasing humans.\n*   **5. Every human chased Lewis.** We proved this is false.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is \"Not all humans chased Lewis.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n*   Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n*   There's at least one of each (donkey, human, monkey).\n*   Not all monkeys saw Hazel. (This means there's at least one monkey who *didn't* see Hazel).\n*   Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n*   Hazel saw Hazel. (This is a self-referential statement, but it confirms Hazel exists and can \"see\").\n*   Hazel isn't asleep.\n*   Hazel is a monkey.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\n1.  **Hazel saw every monkey.**\n    *   We know \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" This implies there's at least one monkey who *didn't* see Hazel.\n    *   If Hazel saw every monkey, then every monkey saw Hazel (from Hazel's perspective).\n    *   However, the statement \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel\" directly contradicts \"Hazel saw every monkey\" if we assume \"X saw Y\" implies Y was seen by X.\n    *   More directly, if Hazel saw every monkey, then for every monkey M, Hazel saw M. This doesn't mean M saw Hazel.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" This means $\\exists M \\text{ (monkey)} \\text{ such that } M \\text{ did not see Hazel}$.\n    *   If \"Hazel saw every monkey\" were true, then for every monkey M, Hazel saw M. This doesn't contradict $\\exists M \\text{ (monkey)} \\text{ such that } M \\text{ did not see Hazel}$.\n    *   However, the phrasing \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is usually interpreted as \"It is not the case that for every monkey M, M saw Hazel.\" This means \"There exists at least one monkey M such that M did not see Hazel.\"\n    *   If Hazel saw every monkey, then Hazel saw herself (since she is a monkey).\n    *   Let's consider the implication: If Hazel saw every monkey, then for every monkey M, Hazel saw M. This doesn't tell us whether M saw Hazel.\n    *   But the statement \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is about *monkeys seeing Hazel*.\n    *   If Hazel saw every monkey, it doesn't mean every monkey saw Hazel.\n    *   Let's re-read carefully: \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" This means $\\neg (\\forall M \\text{ (monkey)}, M \\text{ saw Hazel})$. This is equivalent to $\\exists M \\text{ (monkey)}, M \\text{ did not see Hazel}$.\n    *   \"Hazel saw every monkey.\" This means $\\forall M \\text{ (monkey)}, \\text{Hazel saw } M$.\n    *   These two statements are not directly contradictory. For example, Hazel could see every monkey, but some monkeys might not have seen Hazel back.\n    *   However, the problem asks what *must* be true. We don't have enough information to conclude this. It's possible, but not necessary.\n\n2.  **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n    *   We know \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" This means there's at least one monkey who *didn't* see Hazel.\n    *   This does *not* mean *no* monkeys saw Hazel. It just means it's not *all* of them. There could be some who did.\n    *   We also know \"Hazel saw Hazel\" and Hazel is a monkey. So, at least one monkey (Hazel herself) saw Hazel.\n    *   Therefore, \"No monkeys saw Hazel\" is false.\n\n3.  **Every monkey saw Hazel.**\n    *   This directly contradicts the given information: \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n4.  **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n    *   We are explicitly told \"Hazel isn't asleep.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5.  **A monkey saw Hazel.**\n    *   We are told \"Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n    *   We are told \"Hazel is a monkey.\"\n    *   Therefore, a monkey (Hazel) saw Hazel.\n    *   This statement must be true.\n\n6.  **Alfred is asleep.**\n    *   We have no information about Alfred's sleep status.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot conclude this must be true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate statement 1 based on the conclusion for statement 5.\nIf \"A monkey saw Hazel\" is true (which it is, because Hazel is a monkey and Hazel saw Hazel), then \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel\" means that while some monkeys saw Hazel (at least Hazel herself), there's at least one monkey who *didn't* see Hazel.\n\nNow, let's reconsider statement 1: \"Hazel saw every monkey.\"\nWe know Hazel is a monkey. So if Hazel saw every monkey, she saw herself. This is consistent with \"Hazel saw Hazel.\"\nHowever, the statement \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel\" means $\\exists M \\text{ (monkey)} \\text{ such that } M \\text{ did not see Hazel}$.\n\"Hazel saw every monkey\" means $\\forall M \\text{ (monkey)}, \\text{Hazel saw } M$.\nThese two statements are not contradictory. For example, there could be three monkeys: M1, M2, M3. Hazel is M1.\nHazel (M1) saw M1, M2, M3.\nBut M2 did not see Hazel (M1). M3 did not see Hazel (M1). M1 (Hazel) saw Hazel (M1).\nIn this scenario, \"Hazel saw every monkey\" is true, and \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is also true (because M2 and M3 didn't see Hazel).\nSo, \"Hazel saw every monkey\" *could* be true, but it is not *necessarily* true based on the given information. We don't have enough information to force this conclusion.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   **Statement 1 (Hazel saw every monkey):** Not necessarily true. We don't have information to confirm this.\n*   **Statement 2 (No monkeys saw Hazel):** False. Hazel is a monkey and saw Hazel.\n*   **Statement 3 (Every monkey saw Hazel):** False. Directly contradicted by \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel.\"\n*   **Statement 4 (Alfred and Hazel are asleep):** False. Hazel isn't asleep.\n*   **Statement 5 (A monkey saw Hazel):** True. Hazel is a monkey and Hazel saw Hazel.\n*   **Statement 6 (Alfred is asleep):** Not necessarily true. No information given.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is statement 5.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This means there is at least one donkey who did *not* kick Alfred.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: No donkeys kicked Alfred or a monkey kicked Lewis.**\n*   \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" is the negation of \"All donkeys kicked Alfred\".\n*   From P6, we know \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\". This is equivalent to \"It is not the case that all donkeys kicked Alfred\".\n*   So, \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" is *not* necessarily true. P6 only tells us *some* donkeys didn't kick Alfred, not that *no* donkeys kicked Alfred.\n*   \"a monkey kicked Lewis\" - we don't have information to confirm or deny this.\n*   Since the first part (\"No donkeys kicked Alfred\") is not necessarily true, and we don't know about the second part, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred and Lewis ate.**\n*   From P4, \"Every monkey ate\". This tells us about monkeys eating, not necessarily about Alfred or Lewis eating.\n*   We don't have any information that states Alfred ate or Lewis ate.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: Lewis isn't a donkey and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n*   \"Lewis isn't a donkey\" is directly stated in P7. This is true.\n*   \"a monkey kicked Alfred\" is directly stated in P5. This is true.\n*   Since both conjuncts are true based on the given information, the entire conjunction must be true.\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey kicked Alfred and Lewis is a donkey.**\n*   \"A monkey kicked Alfred\" is true (from P5).\n*   \"Lewis is a donkey\" is false (from P7, \"It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey\").\n*   Since one of the conjuncts is false, the entire conjunction must be false. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n**Statement 5: No donkeys kicked Alfred unless a monkey kicked Lewis.**\n*   This statement is equivalent to: \"If a monkey did not kick Lewis, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n*   Let's rephrase \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" as \"It is not the case that any donkey kicked Alfred\" or \"All donkeys did not kick Alfred\".\n*   From P6, we know \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\". This means there is at least one donkey who *didn't* kick Alfred. It does *not* mean \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\".\n*   We don't know if \"a monkey kicked Lewis\" is true or false.\n*   Since \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" is not necessarily true (P6 only says *not all* donkeys kicked Alfred), we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred ate.**\n*   From P4, \"Every monkey ate\". This tells us about monkeys eating.\n*   We have no information that states Alfred ate. Alfred could be a human, a donkey, or a monkey. Even if Alfred is a monkey, we don't know if Alfred is *the* monkey that kicked Alfred (which would be self-kicking, but possible in logic). However, the statement \"Alfred ate\" is not directly supported by the premises.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

(This is a red herring for the statements about kicking, as it doesn't provide direct information about the kicking relationships among monkeys).\n\n**Analyzing Event 2: \"Every monkey kicked a monkey that kicked it.\"**\n\nLet M be the set of all monkeys.\nLet K(x, y) mean \"x kicked y\".\n\nThe statement means: For every monkey $m_1 \\in M$, there exists a monkey $m_2 \\in M$ such that $K(m_1, m_2)$ AND $K(m_2, m_1)$.\n\nLet's consider the implications of this:\n\n*   If there's only one monkey ($m_A$), then $m_A$ must have kicked $m_A$, and $m_A$ must have kicked $m_A$. So, $m_A$ kicked $m_A$.\n*   If there are multiple monkeys, say $m_A, m_B, m_C$.\n    *   For $m_A$: $m_A$ kicked some $m_X$ and $m_X$ kicked $m_A$. ($m_X$ could be $m_A$).\n    *   For $m_B$: $m_B$ kicked some $m_Y$ and $m_Y$ kicked $m_B$. ($m_Y$ could be $m_B$).\n    *   And so on for every monkey.\n\nThis statement guarantees that *every* monkey is involved in a reciprocal kicking relationship with *at least one* other monkey (which could be itself).\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n1.  **There is a monkey that every monkey kicked.**\n    *   This means there exists a monkey $m_X$ such that for every monkey $m_Y$, $K(m_Y, m_X)$.\n    *   The given information states \"Every monkey kicked a monkey that kicked it.\" It doesn't say that all monkeys kicked the *same* monkey.\n    *   Consider a scenario with two monkeys, $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n        *   $m_1$ kicked $m_2$, and $m_2$ kicked $m_1$. (This satisfies the condition for both $m_1$ and $m_2$).\n        *   In this scenario, $m_1$ did not kick $m_1$, and $m_2$ did not kick $m_2$.\n        *   Does $m_1$ kick $m_2$? Yes. Does $m_2$ kick $m_2$? No. So $m_2$ is not a monkey that every monkey kicked.\n        *   Does $m_2$ kick $m_1$? Yes. Does $m_1$ kick $m_1$? No. So $m_1$ is not a monkey that every monkey kicked.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **No monkeys kicked every monkey.**\n    *   This means for every monkey $m_X$, it is NOT true that $m_X$ kicked every monkey.\n    *   In other words, for every monkey $m_X$, there exists at least one monkey $m_Y$ such that $m_X$ did not kick $m_Y$.\n    *   Consider a scenario where there is only one monkey, $m_A$.\n        *   \"Every monkey kicked a monkey that kicked it\" implies $m_A$ kicked $m_A$.\n        *   In this case, $m_A$ *did* kick every monkey (because $m_A$ is the only monkey).\n        *   So, this statement (\"No monkeys kicked every monkey\") would be false in the single-monkey scenario.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Every monkey kicked every monkey.**\n    *   This means for every monkey $m_X$ and every monkey $m_Y$, $K(m_X, m_Y)$.\n    *   Consider the two-monkey scenario from statement 1: $m_1$ kicked $m_2$, and $m_2$ kicked $m_1$.\n        *   Does $m_1$ kick $m_1$? No. Does $m_2$ kick $m_2$? No.\n        *   So, it's not true that every monkey kicked every monkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **No monkeys kicked a monkey.**\n    *   This means for every monkey $m_X$, there is no monkey $m_Y$ such that $K(m_X, m_Y)$. In other words, no monkey kicked any monkey.\n    *   This directly contradicts \"Every monkey kicked a monkey that kicked it.\" If every monkey kicked *a* monkey, then it's impossible that *no* monkey kicked *a* monkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5.  **A monkey kicked a monkey.**\n    *   The statement \"Every monkey kicked a monkey that kicked it\" directly implies this.\n    *   If every monkey (and we know there's at least one monkey) kicked *some* monkey, then it must be true that *at least one* monkey kicked *at least one* monkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6.  **A monkey kicked every monkey.**\n    *   This means there exists a monkey $m_X$ such that for every monkey $m_Y$, $K(m_X, m_Y)$.\n    *   Consider the two-monkey scenario: $m_1$ kicked $m_2$, and $m_2$ kicked $m_1$.\n        *   Did $m_1$ kick every monkey? No, $m_1$ didn't kick $m_1$.\n        *   Did $m_2$ kick every monkey? No, $m_2$ didn't kick $m_2$.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This means for every monkey $m_i$, there exists a donkey $d_j$ such that $m_i$ chased $d_j$ AND $d_j$ chased $m_i$.\n*   A monkey kicked Alfred unless a monkey will attack. (This statement seems to be a distractor for the given options, as it doesn't directly relate to the chasing relationships between donkeys and monkeys).\n\n**Analyzing the Crucial Premise:**\n\n\"Every monkey chased a donkey that chased it.\"\n\nLet's represent this formally:\nFor every monkey $m \\in M$, there exists a donkey $d \\in D$ such that:\n1.  $m$ chased $d$\n2.  $d$ chased $m$\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n1.  **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   From the premise, for *every* monkey $m$, there *exists* a donkey $d$ that chased *that specific* monkey $m$.\n    *   This means that for $m_1$, there's a $d_a$ that chased $m_1$. For $m_2$, there's a $d_b$ that chased $m_2$. It's possible $d_a$ is different from $d_b$.\n    *   This statement claims there is *one specific donkey* that chased *all* monkeys. The premise doesn't guarantee this. It only guarantees that for each monkey, *some* donkey chased it.\n    *   *Example:* Monkey A chased Donkey X (who chased A). Monkey B chased Donkey Y (who chased B). Donkey X did not necessarily chase Monkey B, and Donkey Y did not necessarily chase Monkey A. So, there isn't necessarily *one* donkey that chased *every* monkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   This is a very strong claim. It means for every donkey $d_i$ and every monkey $m_j$, $d_i$ chased $m_j$.\n    *   The premise only states that for each monkey, *some* donkey chased *that specific* monkey. It doesn't say *all* donkeys chased *all* monkeys.\n    *   *Example:* If Donkey X chased Monkey A, it doesn't mean Donkey X also chased Monkey B.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n    *   This means for every donkey $d_i$, there exists at least one monkey $m_j$ such that $d_i$ chased $m_j$.\n    *   The premise states: \"Every monkey ($m$) chased a donkey ($d$) that chased it ($m$).\"\n    *   This implies that for every monkey $m$, there is a donkey $d$ such that $d$ chased $m$.\n    *   Since there is at least one monkey and at least one donkey, let's consider the set of donkeys that are involved in this \"chasing back\" relationship.\n    *   Let $M = \\{m_1, m_2, ..., m_k\\}$ be the set of monkeys.\n    *   For each $m_i$, there exists a $d_j \\in D$ such that $d_j$ chased $m_i$.\n    *   This means that the set of donkeys that chased *some* monkey is non-empty.\n    *   However, the statement \"Every donkey chased a monkey\" means *all* donkeys must have chased *at least one* monkey.\n    *   The premise only guarantees that for every monkey, *some* donkey chased it. It doesn't guarantee that *every* donkey is involved in this chasing relationship. There could be a donkey that didn't chase any monkey (and wasn't chased by any monkey).\n    *   *Example:* Monkey A chased Donkey X (who chased A). Monkey B chased Donkey Y (who chased B). If there's a Donkey Z that wasn't involved in any of these pairs, then Donkey Z didn't chase any monkey. In this case, \"Every donkey chased a monkey\" would be false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 1: \"A donkey chased every monkey.\"\n    *   If statement 1 is not necessarily true, then its negation is not necessarily true either.\n    *   However, let's re-evaluate statement 1. We concluded it's not necessarily true because there might not be *one specific donkey* that chased *all* monkeys.\n    *   Could it be true that *no* donkey chased *every* monkey?\n    *   Consider a scenario with Monkey A, Monkey B, Donkey X, Donkey Y.\n        *   A chased X (X chased A)\n        *   B chased Y (Y chased B)\n    *   In this scenario, X did not chase B, and Y did not chase A. So, neither X nor Y chased *every* monkey. This would make \"No donkeys chased every monkey\" true.\n    *   What if there's only one monkey, M1, and one donkey, D1?\n        *   M1 chased D1 (D1 chased M1).\n        *   In this case, D1 *did* chase every monkey (because M1 is the only monkey). So, \"A donkey chased every monkey\" would be true.\n        *   And \"No donkeys chased every monkey\" would be false.\n    *   Since there's a scenario where it's false (e.g., only one monkey), this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n    *   The premise states: \"Every monkey chased a donkey that chased it.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one monkey (given: \"at least one of each\"), let's call it $m_1$.\n    *   According to the premise, for $m_1$, there exists a donkey, let's call it $d_1$, such that $m_1$ chased $d_1$ AND $d_1$ chased $m_1$.\n    *   The existence of $d_1$ and $m_1$ such that $d_1$ chased $m_1$ directly proves this statement.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6.  **No donkeys chased a monkey.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 5: \"A donkey chased a monkey.\"\n    *   Since statement 5 must be true, its negation must be false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the premise \"Every monkey chased a donkey that chased it\" and the fact that there is at least one monkey and at least one donkey, the only statement that must be true is that there exists at least one instance of a donkey chasing a monkey.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

So, if Alfred is a human, then Alfred saw Alfred ($S(\\text{Alfred}, \\text{Alfred})$).\n*   Now consider fact 1: \"No humans saw a human that saw it.\"\n    If Alfred saw Alfred, then Alfred saw a human (himself) that saw him (himself). This directly contradicts fact 1.\n*   Therefore, Alfred cannot be a human.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 1: False.**\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred isn't a human.** (Alfred $\\notin$ H)\n\n*   As derived above, assuming Alfred is a human leads to a contradiction with fact 1.\n*   Therefore, Alfred must not be a human.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 4: True.**\n\nNow that we know Alfred isn't a human, let's consider the other possibilities for Alfred: Alfred is a donkey or Alfred is a monkey.\n\n**Statement 3: Alfred is a donkey.** (Alfred $\\in$ D)\n\n*   We know Alfred $\\notin$ H.\n*   Could Alfred be a donkey?\n*   Fact 3 states: Every human saw Alfred. So, $\\forall h \\in H: S(h, \\text{Alfred})$.\n*   There is no contradiction with any other facts if Alfred is a donkey.\n    *   Fact 1 (humans seeing humans) is not relevant here.\n    *   Fact 2 (donkeys not seeing Lewis) is not relevant to humans seeing Alfred.\n    *   Fact 4 (monkeys kicking Lewis) is not relevant.\n    *   Fact 5 (Lewis not a donkey) is not relevant.\n*   So, it is *possible* for Alfred to be a donkey, but is it *necessary*?\n*   Let's consider if Alfred could be a monkey.\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred isn't a donkey.** (Alfred $\\notin$ D)\n\n*   If Alfred isn't a human (which we've established) and Alfred isn't a donkey, then Alfred must be a monkey (since everything is one of the three).\n*   If Alfred is a monkey, then Fact 3 still holds: Every human saw Alfred (a monkey). This doesn't create any contradictions.\n*   Since Alfred could be a donkey or a monkey without contradiction, neither \"Alfred is a donkey\" nor \"Alfred isn't a donkey\" *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 3: Not necessarily true.**\n**Conclusion for Statement 5: Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Statement 2: Lewis is a donkey.** (Lewis $\\in$ D)\n\n*   We know Lewis $\\notin$ D (Fact 5).\n*   Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 2: False.**\n\n**Summary of findings:**\n*   Statement 1: False\n*   Statement 2: False\n*   Statement 3: Not necessarily true\n*   Statement 4: True\n*   Statement 5: Not necessarily true\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is Statement 4.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

These are exclusive.\n*   **Existence:** At least one of each (D, H, M).\n*   **Donkeys & Hazel:** Every donkey saw Hazel.\n*   **Hazel's Sight:** Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n*   **Drinking:** Only humans drank.\n*   **Donkeys & Lewis/Hunger (Conditional 1):** Not all donkeys saw Lewis (A) only if not all donkeys are hungry (B). This is A -> B.\n*   **Monkeys & Hazel / Humans & Hazel / Lewis & Hunger (Conditional 2):** If every monkey chased Hazel (C), then (a human chased Hazel (D) only if Lewis is hungry (E)). This is C -> (D -> E).\n*   **Alfred's Hunger:** Alfred isn't hungry.\n*   **Lewis's Drinking:** It is not the case that Lewis drank (i.e., Lewis didn't drink).\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n1.  **Lewis's Category:** Since Lewis didn't drink, and only humans drank, Lewis cannot be a human. So, Lewis is either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n2.  **Alfred's Drinking:** Alfred isn't hungry. The information about hunger is related to donkeys and Lewis, and monkeys and Hazel. It doesn't directly tell us about Alfred's drinking. However, we know \"only humans drank.\" If Alfred drank, Alfred must be a human. If Alfred didn't drink, Alfred could be any category.\n\n3.  **Hazel's Category:**\n    *   \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\"\n    *   \"Every donkey saw Hazel.\"\n    *   If Hazel were a donkey, then Hazel (as a donkey) would have seen Hazel. But Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n    *   Therefore, **Hazel cannot be a donkey.**\n\n4.  **Revisiting Conditional 1 (A -> B):**\n    *   A: Not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n    *   B: Not all donkeys are hungry.\n    *   We know Alfred isn't hungry.\n    *   If Alfred is a donkey, then \"not all donkeys are hungry\" (B) would be true because Alfred (a donkey) isn't hungry.\n    *   This conditional doesn't give us a definitive truth value for A or B yet, nor does it help us categorize Alfred.\n\n5.  **Revisiting Conditional 2 (C -> (D -> E)):**\n    *   C: Every monkey chased Hazel.\n    *   D: A human chased Hazel.\n    *   E: Lewis is hungry.\n    *   We know Lewis is not a human (from deduction 1).\n    *   This conditional doesn't give us a definitive truth value for C, D, or E yet.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's check each statement based on our deductions:\n\n*   **1. Hazel is a donkey.**\n    *   From deduction 3, we concluded that Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **False**.\n\n*   **2. Alfred drank.**\n    *   We know \"only humans drank.\"\n    *   If Alfred drank, Alfred must be a human.\n    *   We don't have enough information to definitively say Alfred is a human or not. Alfred isn't hungry, but that doesn't preclude him from being a human or from drinking.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **Cannot be determined / Not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **3. Hazel isn't a donkey.**\n    *   From deduction 3, we concluded that Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **True**.\n\n*   **4. Alfred didn't drink.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we don't have enough information to definitively say Alfred didn't drink. If Alfred is a human, he could have drunk. If Alfred is a donkey or a monkey, he didn't drink. We don't know Alfred's category.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **Cannot be determined / Not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **5. Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n    *   For this to be true, both Alfred and Hazel must have drunk.\n    *   If Hazel drank, then Hazel must be a human (because only humans drank).\n    *   We don't know if Alfred drank (see statement 2).\n    *   We don't know if Hazel drank (we only know Hazel isn't a donkey). Hazel could be a human and have drunk, or a monkey and not have drunk.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **Cannot be determined / Not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **6. Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n    *   We know \"It is not the case that Lewis drank\" (i.e., Lewis didn't drink).\n    *   For this statement to be true, Lewis must have drunk.\n    *   Since Lewis didn't drink, this statement is **False**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only one statement must be true.\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n**3. Hazel isn't a donkey.**",

(DLK)\n*   Not all donkeys chased Alfred. (\u00ac\u2200DC A)\n*   Only humans are hungry. (H \u2192 Hungry) and (Hungry \u2192 H) - This means if something is hungry, it must be a human, and if something is a human, it *can* be hungry (but not necessarily is). More precisely, it means: If X is hungry, then X is a human. And if X is not a human, then X is not hungry.\n*   Not all donkeys kicked Alfred. (\u00ac\u2200DK A)\n\n**Analyzing the \"Only humans are hungry\" statement:**\n\nThis is crucial. It means:\n*   If someone is hungry, they are a human.\n*   If someone is not a human, they are not hungry.\n*   Donkeys are not humans, so donkeys are not hungry.\n*   Monkeys are not humans, so monkeys are not hungry.\n\n**Evaluating each statement:**\n\n**1. Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n*   From \"Only humans are hungry,\" if Alfred is hungry, Alfred must be a human.\n*   From \"Only humans are hungry,\" if Lewis is hungry, Lewis must be a human.\n*   We know \"A donkey kicked Lewis.\" If Lewis were a human, a donkey kicked a human. This is possible.\n*   However, we have no information that *forces* Alfred or Lewis to be hungry. They could be humans who are not hungry, or they could be donkeys or monkeys (in which case they cannot be hungry).\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**2. Alfred is hungry.**\n*   Similar to statement 1, we have no information that forces Alfred to be hungry. If Alfred were hungry, he would have to be a human. But we don't know if Alfred is a human, or if he is hungry.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**3. No donkeys kicked Alfred or no humans are hungry.**\n*   Let's rephrase \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" as \"It is not the case that some donkey kicked Alfred\" (\u00ac\u2203DK A) or \"All donkeys did not kick Alfred\" (\u2200D \u00acDK A).\n*   We are given \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" (\u00ac\u2200DK A). This means \"There exists at least one donkey that did not kick Alfred\" (\u2203D \u00acDK A). This is *not* the same as \"No donkeys kicked Alfred.\" \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" means *zero* donkeys kicked Alfred. \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" means *at least one* donkey didn't, but some might have.\n*   So, \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" (\u00ac\u2203DK A) is not necessarily true.\n*   \"No humans are hungry\" (\u2200H \u00acHungry). This contradicts \"Only humans are hungry\" if there *are* hungry people. However, \"Only humans are hungry\" doesn't mean there *are* hungry humans, just that if someone is hungry, they are human. It's possible no one is hungry, in which case \"No humans are hungry\" would be true.\n*   Since the first part (\"No donkeys kicked Alfred\") is not necessarily true, and the second part (\"no humans are hungry\") is not necessarily true, and we need the disjunction to be true, let's consider the negation.\n*   The negation of \"No donkeys kicked Alfred or no humans are hungry\" is \"Some donkeys kicked Alfred AND some humans are hungry.\"\n*   We don't know if some donkeys kicked Alfred (we only know not *all* did). We don't know if some humans are hungry.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**4. Alfred isn't hungry.**\n*   We know \"Only humans are hungry.\"\n*   If Alfred is a donkey, Alfred isn't hungry.\n*   If Alfred is a monkey, Alfred isn't hungry.\n*   If Alfred is a human, Alfred *might* be hungry or *might not* be hungry. We have no information to determine this.\n*   Since Alfred *could* be a human and *could* be hungry, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**5. No donkeys kicked Alfred unless no humans are hungry.**\n*   This is a conditional statement: \"If not (no humans are hungry), then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n*   Or, equivalently: \"If some humans are hungry, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n*   Let's analyze the components:\n    *   \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" (\u00ac\u2203DK A). As discussed in statement 3, this is not necessarily true. We only know \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" (\u00ac\u2200DK A), which means \"There exists at least one donkey that did not kick Alfred.\" This allows for the possibility that *some* donkeys *did* kick Alfred.\n    *   \"No humans are hungry\" (\u2200H \u00acHungry). This is not necessarily true. There could be hungry humans.\n*   Let's consider the contrapositive: \"If some donkeys kicked Alfred, then some humans are hungry.\"\n*   We don't know if some donkeys kicked Alfred. We don't know if some humans are hungry.\n*   Let's re-evaluate the \"unless\" structure. \"A unless B\" means \"If not B, then A\".\n    *   A = \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" (\u00ac\u2203DK A)\n    *   B = \"No humans are hungry\" (\u2200H \u00acHungry)\n    *   So, \"If it is not the case that (no humans are hungry), then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n    *   \"If some humans are hungry, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n*   We are given \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" (\u00ac\u2200DK A). This means there's at least one donkey that didn't kick Alfred. It does *not* mean that *no* donkeys kicked Alfred.\n*   Consider a scenario: Some humans are hungry. Does this force \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\"? No. We have no such rule.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**6. Only humans are hungry and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.**\n*   \"Only humans are hungry\" is explicitly given as a premise. So, this part is true.\n*   \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is explicitly given as a premise. So, this part is true.\n*   Since both conjuncts are explicitly given as true premises, their conjunction must also be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 6 is a direct restatement of two of the given premises, and therefore must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

(This is self-referential and doesn't directly tell us Lewis's type or much else about the world, other than Lewis exists).\n4.  **Donkey Chasing Rule 1:** Every donkey (d1) chased every donkey (d2) that chased d1.\n    *   Symbolically: $\\forall d_1 \\in D, \\forall d_2 \\in D: (d_2 \\text{ chased } d_1) \\implies (d_1 \\text{ chased } d_2)$\n5.  **Human Traits:** Only humans are hungry, and every human is happy.\n    *   $\\forall x: (\\text{Hungry}(x) \\iff \\text{Human}(x))$\n    *   $\\forall h \\in H: \\text{Happy}(h)$\n6.  **Donkey Chasing Rule 2 (Alfred):** Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\n    *   Let A be the set of donkeys that chased Alfred.\n    *   Let D be the set of all donkeys.\n    *   \"All donkeys chased Alfred\" means $A = D$.\n    *   \"No donkeys chased Alfred\" means $A = \\emptyset$.\n    *   The statement is: $\\neg (A = D) \\iff \\neg (A = \\emptyset)$.\n    *   This is equivalent to: $(A \\neq D) \\iff (A \\neq \\emptyset)$.\n    *   This means that either (A is not D AND A is not empty) OR (A is D AND A is empty).\n    *   Since D is not empty (there's at least one donkey), A cannot be both D and empty.\n    *   Therefore, it must be that **A is not D AND A is not empty**.\n    *   This means: **Some donkeys chased Alfred, and not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n7.  **Conditional Rule (Lewis, Hazel):** If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n    *   Let HCL be \"A human chased Lewis\".\n    *   Let HNHH be \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\".\n    *   Let EMSH be \"Every monkey saw Hazel\".\n    *   The statement is: $HCL \\implies (HNHH \\iff EMSH)$.\n\n**Analysis of Donkey Chasing Rule 1:**\n\n\"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\"\n$\\forall d_1 \\in D, \\forall d_2 \\in D: (d_2 \\text{ chased } d_1) \\implies (d_1 \\text{ chased } d_2)$\n\nThis rule describes a property of the \"chased\" relation among donkeys. Let's call the relation $C(x, y)$ meaning \"x chased y\".\nThe rule states: $\\forall d_1, d_2 \\in D: C(d_2, d_1) \\implies C(d_1, d_2)$.\nThis means the \"chased\" relation *among donkeys* is **symmetric**.\n\n**Now let's evaluate each statement:**\n\n**1. Every donkey chased every donkey.**\n    *   Symbolically: $\\forall d_1 \\in D, \\forall d_2 \\in D: C(d_1, d_2)$.\n    *   This implies that the \"chased\" relation is total (every donkey chased every other donkey, including itself).\n    *   Does the symmetry rule (from given info 4) imply this? No. If $d_2$ didn't chase $d_1$, then $d_1$ is not required to chase $d_2$. The rule only applies if there *was* chasing in one direction.\n    *   Consider a scenario with two donkeys, D1 and D2. If D1 chased D2, then D2 must have chased D1. But it's possible that D1 didn't chase D2 at all.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. No donkeys chased every donkey.**\n    *   Symbolically: $\\neg \\exists d_1 \\in D, \\forall d_2 \\in D: C(d_1, d_2)$.\n    *   This means there isn't a single donkey that chased all other donkeys (and itself).\n    *   This is the negation of \"Some donkey chased every donkey.\"\n    *   We don't have information to confirm or deny this. It's possible that one donkey chased all others, and due to symmetry, all others chased it back.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.**\n    *   Symbolically: $\\exists d_1 \\in D, \\forall d_2 \\in D: (d_2 \\text{ chased } d_1) \\implies (d_1 \\text{ chased } d_2)$.\n    *   This is exactly the statement of given information 4, but with an existential quantifier (\"A donkey\") instead of a universal quantifier (\"Every donkey\").\n    *   Since \"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased it\" is true, it logically follows that \"A donkey chased every donkey that chased it\" must also be true (because if it's true for *all*, it's true for *at least one*).\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n**4. A donkey chased every donkey.**\n    *   Symbolically: $\\exists d_1 \\in D, \\forall d_2 \\in D: C(d_1, d_2)$.\n    *   This means there exists at least one donkey that chased all other donkeys (and itself).\n    *   This is the negation of statement 2.\n    *   We don't have information to confirm or deny this.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. A donkey chased a donkey.**\n    *   Symbolically: $\\exists d_1 \\in D, \\exists d_2 \\in D: C(d_1, d_2)$.\n    *   This means there was at least one instance of one donkey chasing another (or itself).\n    *   Consider the Alfred rule (Given info 6): \"Some donkeys chased Alfred, and not all donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n    *   This explicitly tells us that the set of donkeys that chased Alfred is non-empty.\n    *   Since Alfred is a donkey (as donkeys chased him), this means there is at least one donkey ($d_x$) such that $d_x$ chased Alfred (who is a donkey).\n    *   Therefore, $C(d_x, \\text{Alfred})$ is true, where $d_x$ and Alfred are both donkeys.\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n**6. Every donkey chased a donkey.**\n    *   Symbolically: $\\forall d_1 \\in D, \\exists d_2 \\in D: C(d_1, d_2)$.\n    *   This means for every donkey, there is at least one donkey that it chased.\n    *   We know that some donkeys chased Alfred (from rule 6). Let $D_A$ be the set of donkeys that chased Alfred. $D_A \\neq \\emptyset$.\n    *   From rule 4 (symmetry): If $d_x \\in D_A$, then $d_x$ chased Alfred. By symmetry, Alfred must have chased $d_x$.\n    *   So, for any $d_x \\in D_A$, $C(d_x, \\text{Alfred})$ is true, and $C(\\text{Alfred}, d_x)$ is true.\n    *   This means Alfred chased at least one donkey (namely, any $d_x \\in D_A$).\n    *   However, this doesn't tell us about *every* donkey. What if there's a donkey $d_y$ that didn't chase Alfred and wasn't chased by Alfred? The symmetry rule doesn't force $d_y$ to chase anyone.\n    *   For example, if there are three donkeys D1, D2, D3. D1 chased Alfred (D2). So D2 chased D1. D3 didn't chase Alfred, and Alfred didn't chase D3. D3 is not required to chase anyone.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions:**\n\n*   Statement 1: Not necessarily true.\n*   Statement 2: Not necessarily true.\n*   Statement 3: **Must be true** (direct consequence of given info 4).\n*   Statement 4: Not necessarily true.\n*   Statement 5: **Must be true** (direct consequence of given info 6).\n*   Statement 6: Not necessarily true.\n\nThe statements that must be true are 3 and 5.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{3, 5}}$",

(This is a biconditional)\n*   **Fact 5:** If Alfred doesn't see Lewis (\u00ac(A sees L)) => ( (A human chased H) => (\u2200m \u2208 M, m sees H) ).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nWe need to determine which of the given statements *must* be true.\n\nLet's re-examine Fact 2: \"There is a monkey that every human saw.\"\nThis statement directly implies the existence of a specific monkey (M_S) such that for *every* human (h), h saw M_S.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n1.  **No humans saw every monkey.**\n    *   This means: \u2200h \u2208 H, \u2203m \u2208 M such that h did not see m.\n    *   This contradicts Fact 2. If there's a monkey (M_S) that *every* human saw, then for any given human, they *did* see M_S. So, it's not true that for every human, there's a monkey they *didn't* see (specifically, they saw M_S).\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 is **false**.\n\n2.  **There is a human that every monkey saw.**\n    *   This means: \u2203h \u2208 H such that \u2200m \u2208 M, m saw h.\n    *   Fact 2 tells us: \u2203m \u2208 M such that \u2200h \u2208 H, h saw m.\n    *   These are different. Fact 2 is about a monkey seen by all humans. Statement 2 is about a human seen by all monkeys. We have no information to confirm or deny statement 2. It *could* be true, but it doesn't *have* to be.\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n3.  **Every human saw every monkey.**\n    *   This means: \u2200h \u2208 H, \u2200m \u2208 M, h saw m.\n    *   Fact 2 only guarantees that there's *one* monkey (M_S) that every human saw. It doesn't say that every human saw *all* monkeys. There could be other monkeys that some humans didn't see.\n    *   Therefore, statement 3 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n4.  **A human saw every monkey.**\n    *   This means: \u2203h \u2208 H such that \u2200m \u2208 M, h saw m.\n    *   This is the same as statement 3, but for *at least one* human.\n    *   Fact 2 tells us: \u2203m \u2208 M such that \u2200h \u2208 H, h saw m.\n    *   Again, this is different. Fact 2 is about a specific monkey seen by all humans. Statement 4 is about a specific human who saw all monkeys.

Lewis will run or every human saw Hazel.**\n    *   We know LSH (Lewis doesn't see Hazel). We don't know anything about Lewis running.\n    *   We don't know if every human saw Hazel (EHS).\n    *   This statement *could* be true, but it's not *necessarily* true. For example, if Lewis doesn't run and not every human saw Hazel, then this statement is false. We don't have enough information to confirm it.\n\n**2. Lewis doesn't see Hazel and no humans will run.**\n    *   \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" (LSH) is true.\n    *   \"no humans will run\" means \"every human will not run\".\n    *   We know \"Not all humans will run\" (NAHR). This means there is at least one human who will not run. It *does not* mean that *no* humans will run. It's possible some humans will run, and some won't.\n    *   Therefore, \"no humans will run\" is not necessarily true.\n    *   Since the second part is not necessarily true, the entire conjunction is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. Lewis doesn't see Hazel and a human will run.**\n    *   \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" (LSH) is true.\n    *   \"a human will run\" means \"there exists at least one human who will run\".\n    *   We know \"Not all humans will run\" (NAHR). This means it's *not* the case that \"every human will run\".\n    *   If \"a human will run\" were false, then \"no human will run\" would be true, which means \"every human will not run\".\n    *   If \"every human will not run\" is true, then \"Not all humans will run\" is also true.\n    *   So, \"a human will run\" is not necessarily true. Consider a scenario where all humans will not run. In that case, \"Not all humans will run\" is true, but \"a human will run\" is false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. Not all humans will run but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   \"Not all humans will run\" (NAHR) is true.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" means \"Lewis sees Hazel\" (~LSH).\n    *   However, we know LSH (Lewis doesn't see Hazel) is true. Therefore, ~LSH (Lewis sees Hazel) is false.\n    *   Since the second part is false, the entire conjunction is false. This statement cannot be true.\n\n**5. Lewis will run unless every human saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"A unless B\" means \"if not B then A\". So, \"If not (every human saw Hazel) then Lewis will run\".\n    *   This is equivalent to: \"Lewis will run or every human saw Hazel\". (This is the same as statement 1).\n    *   As analyzed for statement 1, this is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. Not all humans will run and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   \"Not all humans will run\" (NAHR) is true (from given information 6).\n    *   \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" (LSH) is true (from given information 4).\n    *   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire conjunction is true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct application of the given information, only statement 6 must be true. The other statements either contain parts that are not necessarily true or parts that are necessarily false.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and deduce the truth of the statements.\n\n**Definitions and Initial Facts:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Donkey (D), Human (H), Monkey (M). These are exclusive and exhaustive.\n*   **Existence:** At least one of each (D, H, M).\n*   **Hazel:** Not a monkey (H is not M). So, Hazel is either a Donkey (D) or a Human (H).\n\n**Analyzing the Clues:**\n\n1.  **\"No donkeys saw a donkey.\"**\n    *   This means if X is a donkey, X did not see any donkey.\n\n2.  **\"No donkeys saw Lewis and only humans ate.\"**\n    *   **Part A: \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"** If X is a donkey, X did not see Lewis.\n    *   **Part B: \"only humans ate.\"** This is crucial. If someone ate, they must be a human. Conversely, if someone is not a human, they did not eat.\n\n3.  **\"No monkeys saw Lewis if and only if a human saw Hazel.\"**\n    *   Let P = \"No monkeys saw Lewis.\"\n    *   Let Q = \"A human saw Hazel.\"\n    *   The statement is P <=> Q. This means (P and Q) or (not P and not Q).\n\n4.  **\"Alfred drank and only donkeys ate.\"**\n    *   **Part A: \"Alfred drank.\"** This is a direct statement about Alfred.\n    *   **Part B: \"only donkeys ate.\"** This is *extremely* important and creates a contradiction with clue 2B.\n\n**Identifying the Contradiction:**\n\n*   From clue 2B: \"only humans ate.\"\n*   From clue 4B: \"only donkeys ate.\"\n\nThese two statements cannot both be true simultaneously. If only humans ate, then donkeys did not eat. If only donkeys ate, then humans did not eat. Since there's at least one of each, and eating is an action, these are mutually exclusive.\n\n**Conclusion from Contradiction:**\n\nThe problem statement contains a logical contradiction. This means that the initial premise (the \"situation\") is impossible. If a set of premises leads to a contradiction, then any statement can be logically derived from it (this is known as the principle of explosion, or *ex falso quodlibet*).\n\nHowever, in typical logical reasoning problems, when a contradiction is found, it usually implies that the situation described *cannot exist*. If the situation cannot exist, then it's impossible for *any* statement to \"must be true in this situation\" because there is no such situation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate if there's any way to interpret \"only humans ate\" and \"only donkeys ate\" that avoids a direct contradiction.\n*   \"Only humans ate\" means: If X ate, then X is a human.\n*   \"Only donkeys ate\" means: If X ate, then X is a donkey.\n\nIf someone (say, X) ate, then X must be a human AND X must be a donkey. But categories are exclusive (Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively)). Therefore, no one can be both a human and a donkey. This means that *no one ate*.\n\nIf \"no one ate\" is the case, then:\n*   \"Only humans ate\" is true (vacuously, because the antecedent \"X ate\" is always false).\n*   \"Only donkeys ate\" is true (vacuously, because the antecedent \"X ate\" is always false).\n\nSo, the contradiction is resolved if we conclude that *no one ate*.\n\nLet's proceed with this interpretation: **No one ate.**\n\n**Revisiting Clues with \"No one ate\":**\n\n*   **Clue 2B: \"only humans ate.\"** Consistent with no one eating.\n*   **Clue 4B: \"only donkeys ate.\"** Consistent with no one eating.\n\n**Now, let's re-evaluate the other clues:**\n\n*   **Hazel:** Not a monkey. So, Hazel is a Donkey (D) or a Human (H).\n*   **Alfred drank.** (From clue 4A) This is a direct statement.\n\n**Let's analyze the options based on \"Alfred drank\" and \"No one ate\":**\n\n1.  **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n    *   We know Alfred drank. We don't know about Lewis yet.\n\n2.  **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n    *   We know Alfred drank. We don't know about Hazel yet.\n\n3.  **Lewis drank.**\n    *   We don't know about Lewis.\n\n4.  **Alfred didn't drink.**\n    *   This contradicts \"Alfred drank\" (from clue 4A). So, this is false.\n\n5.  **Alfred drank and Hazel is a monkey.**\n    *   We know Alfred drank.\n    *   We know Hazel is *not* a monkey (given).\n    *   Therefore, \"Hazel is a monkey\" is false.\n    *   So, \"Alfred drank and Hazel is a monkey\" is (True AND False) which is False.\n\n6.  **Alfred drank but it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey.**\n    *   \"Alfred drank\" is True (from clue 4A).\n    *   \"it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey\" is True (given that Hazel isn't a monkey).\n    *   Therefore, (True AND True) is True.\n\n**Therefore, statement 6 must be true.**\n\nLet's double-check if any other information could contradict this or make other options true.\n\n*   **\"No donkeys saw a donkey.\"** (No impact on drinking or Hazel's type)\n*   **\"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"** (No impact on drinking or Hazel's type)\n*   **\"No monkeys saw Lewis if and only if a human saw Hazel.\"**\n    *   This statement is P <=> Q.\n    *   We know Hazel is D or H.\n    *   If Hazel is D, then \"a human saw Hazel\" (Q) might be true or false depending on whether any human saw that specific donkey.\n    *   If Hazel is H, then \"a human saw Hazel\" (Q) might be true or false depending on whether any human saw that specific human.\n    *   This clue doesn't directly affect Alfred drinking or Hazel's type (not a monkey).\n\nThe crucial part was resolving the apparent contradiction between \"only humans ate\" and \"only donkeys ate\" by concluding that *no one ate*. Once that's established, \"Alfred drank\" is a direct given, and \"Hazel isn't a monkey\" is also a direct given.\n\nFinal check:\n*   \"Alfred drank\" is explicitly stated in the problem (\"Alfred drank and only donkeys ate.\").\n*   \"it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey\" is explicitly stated in the problem (\"Hazel isn't a monkey.\").\n\nBoth parts of statement 6 are directly given facts in the problem description.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

No donkeys saw Lewis (NDSL). This means if X is a donkey, then X did not see Lewis.\n6.  It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel (\u00ac(L\u00acSH)).

This doesn't contradict anything directly.\nHowever, let's consider the implications of Hazel being a donkey.\nIf Hazel is a donkey, then from statement 5 (\"No donkeys saw Lewis\"), it would imply that Hazel did not see Lewis.

(This means for every monkey $m_i$, there exists at least one monkey $m_j$ such that $m_i$ did *not* see $m_j$.)\n4.  **Monkey Seeing Rule 2:** Every monkey saw every monkey that saw it. (If monkey $A$ saw monkey $B$, then monkey $B$ saw monkey $A$. This implies the \"saw\" relationship among monkeys is symmetric.)\n5.  **Alfred/Hazel Rule:** If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if a human chased Hazel. (This rule involves donkeys, humans, Alfred, and Hazel, and seems to be a distractor for the monkey-related statements, as it doesn't directly impact the relationships *among* monkeys.)\n\n**Analyzing the Monkey Statements:**\n\nLet $S(m_i, m_j)$ denote that monkey $m_i$ saw monkey $m_j$.\n\nFrom Rule 2: $S(m_i, m_j) \\implies S(m_j, m_i)$. This means the \"saw\" relationship is symmetric.\n\nFrom Rule 3: For every monkey $m_i$, there exists a monkey $m_j$ such that $S(m_i, m_j)$ is false.\n\nLet's consider the implications of these rules.\n\n**Consider the case of a single monkey:**\nIf there were only one monkey, say $M_1$.\nRule 3: $M_1$ did not see every monkey. Since $M_1$ is the only monkey, this means $M_1$ did not see $M_1$.\nRule 2: Every monkey saw every monkey that saw it. If $M_1$ saw $M_1$, then $M_1$ saw $M_1$. This doesn't help much.\nHowever, if $M_1$ did not see $M_1$, then Rule 2 is vacuously true for $M_1$ seeing $M_1$.\n\nBut, if there's only one monkey, $M_1$, then \"every monkey\" refers only to $M_1$.\nRule 3 states: \"No monkeys saw every monkey.\" This means $M_1$ did not see $M_1$.\nThis is a consistent scenario.\n\n**Consider the case of multiple monkeys (at least two):**\nLet $M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_k$ be the monkeys, where $k \\ge 1$.\n\n**Let's evaluate each statement:**\n\n**1. A monkey saw a monkey.**\n*   Assume this is false. This means no monkey saw any monkey.\n*   If no monkey saw any monkey, then for any monkey $m_i$, $m_i$ did not see $m_i$, and for any $m_j \\ne m_i$, $m_i$ did not see $m_j$.\n*   This implies that for every monkey $m_i$, $m_i$ did not see every monkey (because it didn't even see itself or any other monkey).\n*   This is consistent with Rule 3 (\"No monkeys saw every monkey\").\n*   Rule 2 (\"Every monkey saw every monkey that saw it\") is vacuously true if no monkey saw any monkey (the premise \"monkey A saw monkey B\" is always false).\n*   Therefore, it is possible that no monkey saw a monkey. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. A monkey saw every monkey.**\n*   This statement is the direct negation of Rule 3 (\"No monkeys saw every monkey\").\n*   Rule 3 states: \"For every monkey $m_i$, there exists at least one monkey $m_j$ such that $m_i$ did *not* see $m_j$.\"\n*   This means no monkey saw every monkey.\n*   Therefore, \"A monkey saw every monkey\" must be false. So, this statement is not true.\n\n**3. No monkeys saw a monkey.**\n*   As shown in the analysis for statement 1, it is possible that no monkey saw a monkey.\n*   If no monkey saw a monkey, then Rule 3 (\"No monkeys saw every monkey\") is satisfied (because if you don't see anyone, you certainly don't see everyone).\n*   Rule 2 (\"Every monkey saw every monkey that saw it\") is vacuously true.\n*   So, this statement *could* be true. It is not *necessarily* true, nor is it necessarily false. We cannot conclude it *must* be true.\n\n**4. Every monkey saw a monkey.**\n*   Assume this is true. This means for every monkey $m_i$, there exists at least one monkey $m_j$ such that $m_i$ saw $m_j$.\n*   This does not contradict Rule 3 (\"No monkeys saw every monkey\"). For example, $M_1$ could see $M_2$ but not $M_3$.\n*   This does not contradict Rule 2 (\"Every monkey saw every monkey that saw it\").\n*   However, consider the scenario where no monkey saw any monkey (as discussed for statement 1). In that scenario, this statement would be false.\n*   Since the \"no monkey saw a monkey\" scenario is consistent with the given rules, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. Every monkey saw every monkey.**\n*   This statement means for every monkey $m_i$, and for every monkey $m_j$, $m_i$ saw $m_j$.\n*   This directly contradicts Rule 3 (\"No monkeys saw every monkey\").\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false. So, this statement is not true.\n\n**6. There is not a monkey that every monkey saw.**\n*   Let's rephrase this: \"It is not the case that there exists a monkey $m_j$ such that every monkey $m_i$ saw $m_j$.\"\n*   In other words: \"For every monkey $m_j$, there exists at least one monkey $m_i$ such that $m_i$ did *not* see $m_j$.\"\n\nLet's test this against the given rules.\n*   Rule 3: \"No monkeys saw every monkey.\" (For every $m_i$, there is an $m_k$ such that $m_i$ did not see $m_k$.)\n*   Rule 2: \"Every monkey saw every monkey that saw it.\" (Symmetry: $S(m_i, m_j) \\implies S(m_j, m_i)$)\n\nLet's assume statement 6 is false.\nIf statement 6 is false, then its negation is true.\nNegation of statement 6: \"There *is* a monkey that every monkey saw.\"\nLet this monkey be $M_X$. So, for every monkey $m_i$, $m_i$ saw $M_X$. ($S(m_i, M_X)$ for all $m_i$).\n\nNow, let's apply Rule 3: \"No monkeys saw every monkey.\"\nThis means for any monkey $m_i$, there must be some monkey $m_j$ such that $m_i$ did *not* see $m_j$.\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary monkey, say $M_A$.\nAccording to Rule 3, $M_A$ did not see every monkey. So there must be some monkey $M_B$ such that $M_A$ did not see $M_B$. ($NOT S(M_A, M_B)$).\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of our assumption (negation of statement 6 is true):\nWe assumed there exists a monkey $M_X$ such that every monkey saw $M_X$.\nSo, $S(M_A, M_X)$ is true.\nAnd $S(M_B, M_X)$ is true.\n\nWhat if $M_B = M_X$?\nIf $M_B = M_X$, then $M_A$ did not see $M_X$. ($NOT S(M_A, M_X)$).\nBut our assumption states that every monkey saw $M_X$, which means $M_A$ *did* see $M_X$.\nThis is a contradiction.\nTherefore, $M_B$ cannot be $M_X$. So $M_B \\ne M_X$.\n\nSo, we have:\n1. There exists $M_X$ such that for all $m_i$, $S(m_i, M_X)$. (Assumption: negation of statement 6)\n2. For any $m_i$, there exists $m_j$ such that $NOT S(m_i, m_j)$. (Rule 3)\n\nLet's take an arbitrary monkey $m_k$.\nFrom Rule 3, there exists some monkey $m_p$ such that $NOT S(m_k, m_p)$.\nFrom our assumption, $S(m_k, M_X)$. This means $m_p \\ne M_X$.\n\nNow, consider $M_X$.\nFrom Rule 3, there exists some monkey $m_q$ such that $NOT S(M_X, m_q)$.\nFrom our assumption, $S(m_q, M_X)$.\n\nNow, apply Rule 2 (Symmetry): $S(m_q, M_X) \\implies S(M_X, m_q)$.\nBut we just derived $NOT S(M_X, m_q)$ from Rule 3 applied to $M_X$.\nThis is a direct contradiction: $S(M_X, m_q)$ and $NOT S(M_X, m_q)$.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption (\"There is a monkey that every monkey saw\") must be false.\nThis means \"There is not a monkey that every monkey saw\" must be true.\n\nLet's re-verify this logic carefully.\n\nAssume statement 6 is false.\nThis means: $\\exists m_j$ such that $\\forall m_i, S(m_i, m_j)$. (Let this $m_j$ be $M_{target}$)\n\nNow, consider Rule 3: $\\forall m_k, \\exists m_p$ such that $NOT S(m_k, m_p)$.\n\nLet's apply Rule 3 to $M_{target}$.\nSo, $\\exists m_p$ such that $NOT S(M_{target}, m_p)$.\n\nNow, consider $m_p$.\nFrom our assumption (negation of statement 6), $m_p$ saw $M_{target}$. So, $S(m_p, M_{target})$.\n\nNow, apply Rule 2 (Symmetry): $S(m_p, M_{target}) \\implies S(M_{target}, m_p)$.\n\nWe have a contradiction:\n1. From",

A monkey ate.**\n\n*   We are given \"Every monkey ate.\"\n*   We are also given \"there's at least one of each\" (donkey, human, monkey).\n*   Since there is at least one monkey, and every monkey ate, it logically follows that at least one monkey ate.\n\n**Therefore, Statement 2 must be true.**\n\n**3.

Therefore, we cannot definitively say if \"not all donkeys will run\" is true or false.\n*   **Conclusion for 1: Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**Statement 2: Lewis will run.**\n*   We know Lewis did not drink and is hungry.\n*   We don't know Lewis's species.\n*   We have no information linking Lewis's hunger or not drinking to whether Lewis will run.\n*   **Conclusion for 2: Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**Statement 3: Not all humans will run and only donkeys are asleep.**\n*   \"Not all humans will run\" is directly given as Fact A. This part is true.\n*   \"Only donkeys are asleep\" is directly given as Fact 6. This part is true.\n*   For an \"AND\" statement to be true, both parts must be true. Both are true.\n*   **Conclusion for 3: Must be true.**\n\n**Statement 4: Only donkeys are asleep and no humans will run.**\n*   \"Only donkeys are asleep\" is true (Fact 6).\n*   \"No humans will run\" means *all* humans will not run.\n*   The given information (Fact A) is \"Not all humans will run,\" which means *at least one* human will not run. It does *not* mean *no* humans will run. Some humans might still run.\n*   Therefore, \"no humans will run\" is not necessarily true.\n*   **Conclusion for 4: Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**Statement 5: A human is asleep unless not all donkeys will run.**\n*   \"P unless Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q then P\" or \"P or Q\".\n*   So, this statement is equivalent to \"A human is asleep OR not all donkeys will run.\"\n*   This is the exact same as Statement 1.\n*   As established for Statement 1, \"A human is asleep\" is false. We don't know if \"not all donkeys will run\" is true.\n*   **Conclusion for 5: Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**Statement 6: Lewis won't run.**\n*   Similar to Statement 2, we have no information about Lewis's running behavior.\n*   **Conclusion for 6: Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

(A v H)\n*   **Lewis's Happiness:** A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy. This means:\n    *   A human saw Lewis.\n    *   Lewis *is* happy. (\u00ac(\u00acHappy(Lewis)) => Happy(Lewis))\n*   **Drinking:** Alfred drank and every monkey drank.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the given information.\n\n**1. A human saw Lewis and Alfred drank.**\n    *   \"A human saw Lewis\": This is directly stated in the given information (\"A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy\").\n    *   \"Alfred drank\": This is directly stated in the given information (\"Alfred drank and every monkey drank\").\n    *   Since both parts are true based on the given information, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**2. A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Alfred drank.**\n    *   \"A human saw Lewis\": True (from given).\n    *   \"it is not the case that Alfred drank\" (i.e., Alfred didn't drink): False, because the given information explicitly states \"Alfred drank\".\n    *   Since one part is false, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**3. Alfred didn't drink.**\n    *   This contradicts the given information \"Alfred drank\".\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**4. Lewis drank.**\n    *   The given information states \"Alfred drank and every monkey drank.\"\n    *   We know Lewis is happy, and a human saw him. We don't know if Lewis is a monkey, a human, or a donkey.\n    *   If Lewis is a monkey, then Lewis drank.\n    *   If Lewis is a human or a donkey, we have no information about whether he drank.\n    *   Since we cannot definitively conclude that Lewis drank, this statement **does not have to be true**.\n\n**5. Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n    *   \"Alfred drank\": True (from given).\n    *   \"Lewis drank\": As established in point 4, we don't know if Lewis drank.\n    *   Since we cannot definitively conclude that Lewis drank, this statement **does not have to be true**.\n\n**6. Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n    *   \"Alfred drank\": True (from given).\n    *   \"Hazel drank\": We know \"Alfred or Hazel are asleep.\" This tells us nothing about whether Hazel drank.\n    *   Since we have no information about whether Hazel drank, this statement **does not have to be true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 is directly and entirely supported by the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",
