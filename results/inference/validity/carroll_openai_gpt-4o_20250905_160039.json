Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **There is a tove that every rath chortled at.**\n   - There is no information given that suggests raths chortle at toves. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at every rath.**\n   - The condition states that every tove chortled at a rath, but it doesn't specify that a tove chortled at every rath. Therefore, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - The condition only states that every tove chortled at a rath, not every rath. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - The condition only states that every tove chortled at a rath, not every rath. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at a rath.**\n   - This is directly supported by the condition that every tove chortled at a rath.

However, it is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle is a tove.**\n   - Zindle cannot be a rath (since Zindle snicker-snacked a rath), and Zindle cannot be a borogove (since borogoves are not mentioned in the context of snicker-snacking or chortling).

Not all toves will whiffle.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Bungo is a tove.**\n   - If Bungo were a tove, Bungo could potentially gimble, but we have no information confirming this. Also, Bungo chortled at Bungo, which doesn't provide any evidence for Bungo being a tove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Bungo gimbled.**\n   - Only toves gimbled. If Bungo gimbled, Bungo must be a tove. However, we have no information confirming that Bungo gimbled. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Bungo didn't gimble.**\n   - Since only toves gimbled, if Bungo didn't gimble, Bungo could be a borogove or a rath. We have no information confirming whether Bungo gimbled or not. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Bungo won't whiffle.**\n   - We know that not all toves will whiffle, but this doesn't provide information about Bungo's ability to whiffle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Bungo will whiffle.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, we have no information confirming whether Bungo will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Bungo chortled at Bungo and only toves gimbled.**\n   - This statement is a combination of two facts: \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" and \"only toves gimbled.\" Both of these are given in the problem statement. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**6. Bungo chortled at Bungo and only toves gimbled.**",

Therefore, every rath chortles at every other rath, including itself.\n\n3. **Not all raths will whiffle and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**  \n   This indicates that at least one rath does not whiffle, and Bungo, who is a rath, chortled at himself, which is consistent with the statement that every rath chortled at every rath.\n\n4. **If Zindle gimbled, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if no toves gimbled.**  \n   This is a conditional statement that doesn't directly affect the chortling behavior of raths, but it introduces a condition involving Zindle, Bungo, and toves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **No raths chortled at a rath that chortled at it.**  \n   This is false because every rath chortled at every rath, including mutual chortling.\n\n2. **There is not a rath that every rath chortled at.**  \n   This is false because every rath chortled at every rath, so every rath is chortled at by every other rath.\n\n3. **No raths chortled at a rath.**  \n   This is false because every rath chortled at every rath.\n\n4. **No raths chortled at every rath.**  \n   This is false because every rath chortled at every rath.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**  \n   The problem does not provide enough information to determine whether Zindle will whiffle. The condition involving Zindle and gimbled is not directly related to whiffling.\n\n6. **A rath chortled at every rath.**  \n   This is true because every rath chortled at every rath, so each rath chortled at every other rath.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**6.

If Zindle will whiffle, then every rath is beamish only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n4. Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n5. No borogoves will whiffle.\n\nLet's break down the implications:\n\n- From statement 5, \"No borogoves will whiffle,\" we know that if Zindle is a borogove, Zindle cannot whiffle.\n\n- From statement 3, \"If Zindle will whiffle, then every rath is beamish only if every borogove chortled at Bungo,\" we can deduce:\n  - If Zindle will whiffle, then for every rath to be beamish, every borogove must have chortled at Bungo.\n  - However, since Bungo chortled at Zindle (statement 4), and not necessarily the other way around, we don't have information about whether every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n- Since Zindle isn't beamish (statement 2), Zindle cannot be a rath because if Zindle were a rath, it would have to be beamish for the condition to hold when Zindle whiffles.\n\n- Therefore, Zindle must be a tove or a borogove. If Zindle is a borogove, it cannot whiffle (statement 5). If Zindle is a tove, we don't have a direct restriction on whiffling from the given statements.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. Zindle won't whiffle.\n   - This is true if Zindle is a borogove, as borogoves cannot whiffle.\n\n2. Zindle isn't beamish and Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n   - This is true based on statements 2 and 4.\n\n3. Zindle isn't beamish but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n   - This is false because Bungo did chortle at Zindle (statement 4).\n\n4. Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.\n   - This cannot be determined as true because Zindle might be a borogove and thus cannot whiffle.\n\n5. Bungo will whiffle.\n   - There is no information about Bungo's ability to whiffle, so this cannot be determined as true.\n\n6. Zindle will whiffle.\n   - This is false if Zindle is a borogove, as borogoves cannot whiffle.\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n1. Zindle won't whiffle.\n2. Zindle isn't beamish and Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n\nFinal answer: Statements 1 and 2 must be true.",

It suggests that if every rath snicker-snacked Rafin, then it must be the case that not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin, which is a contradiction. Therefore, not every rath can snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n5. **If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.**\n   - This conditional statement involves borogoves and raths. However, it doesn't directly involve toves or chortling, so it doesn't immediately help us with the chortling statements.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Every tove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - This statement suggests that each tove chortled at some borogove. However, we know that no toves chortled at Bungo, who is a borogove. Since Bungo is a borogove and no toves chortled at him, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Every tove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This is a stronger version of statement 1. Since statement 1 is false, this statement is also false.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at a borogove.**\n   - This statement suggests that no toves chortled at any borogove. We know that no toves chortled at Bungo, who is a borogove. However, this does not necessarily mean that no toves chortled at any borogove, as there could be other borogoves at whom toves did chortle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is no tove that chortled at every borogove. Since no toves chortled at Bungo, it is impossible for any tove to have chortled at every borogove (because they would have to chortle at Bungo to do so). Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **A tove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This is the opposite of statement 4. Since statement 4 is true, this statement must be false.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - This statement suggests that there exists at least one tove that chortled at some borogove. We have no information that directly supports or contradicts this statement, so it is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n4.

We know a borogove will burble, and a borogove chortled at Rafin, but we don't know if Rafin is a borogove. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **Every rath gimbled and a borogove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - We know from the given information that every rath gimbled.

However, since no borogoves chortled at Zindle, Bungo must be beamish.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Bungo is uffish.**\n   - We have no information directly linking Bungo to being uffish. The conditions provided do not imply this.\n\n2. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - There is no information about Zindle being uffish or not.\n\n3. **Bungo isn't beamish.**\n   - From the condition \"A borogove chortled at Zindle just in case Bungo isn't beamish,\" and knowing that no borogoves chortled at Zindle, we conclude that Bungo must be beamish. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo are uffish.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle being uffish, and we have already determined that Bungo being uffish is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Bungo is beamish.**\n   - As reasoned above, since no borogoves chortled at Zindle, Bungo must be beamish. This statement is true.\n\n6. **Zindle isn't uffish.**\n   - There is no information provided that directly addresses whether Zindle is uffish or not.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n5.

The conditions do not explicitly require this, so it cannot be concluded as a necessity.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at a rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is at least one borogove that chortled at at least one rath. Given that every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it, there must be at least one borogove that chortled at a rath.

This doesn't necessarily imply that a rath did galumph over Rafin, but it does not contradict it either. The statement \"not all raths chortled at Bungo\" is not directly addressed in the given information, so we cannot definitively conclude this option as true.\n\n2. **Bungo chortled at Bungo and not all raths galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - The statement \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is not addressed in the given information. We know \"not all raths galumphed over Rafin\" is true, but without information about Bungo chortling at Bungo, we cannot conclude this option as true.\n\n3. **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and not all raths galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - Similar to option 2, we know \"not all raths galumphed over Rafin\" is true.

We are also given that \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\" Both parts of this statement are directly supported by the given information, so this option must be true.\n\n5. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - This option contradicts the given information that \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\" Therefore, this option cannot be true.\n\n6. **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and every rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - We know \"not all raths galumphed over Rafin,\" so the statement \"every rath galumphed over Rafin\" is false.

From condition 6, if no borogoves are beamish, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, which implies not all toves gyred. Therefore, the second part \"only toves gyred\" cannot be true if the first part is true. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves are beamish and every tove gyred.**\n\n   - From condition 6, if no borogoves are beamish, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, which implies not all toves gyred.

However, we have no information about Zindle and Rafin being raths or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **Only raths are mimsy.**\n   - This would mean that if something is mimsy, it must be a rath. However, we only know that every rath is mimsy, not that mimsy things must be raths. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No raths are mimsy.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every rath is mimsy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **A rath is mimsy.**\n   - This is directly given in the problem: every rath is mimsy. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle being a rath or otherwise being mimsy. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Not all raths are mimsy.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every rath is mimsy.

No toves will burble just in case Bungo isn't beamish.\n\nLet's break down the implications:\n\n- Since Bungo is beamish (as stated in condition 3), the condition \"No toves will burble just in case Bungo isn't beamish\" does not apply. This means that toves can burble because the condition for them not burbling (Bungo not being beamish) is false.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. A tove will burble.\n   - Since Bungo is beamish, the condition preventing toves from burbling is not met. Therefore, it is possible for a tove to burble, but this does not guarantee that a tove will burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. Every tove will burble.\n   - The condition does not imply that every tove will burble, only that they can burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. Not all toves will burble.\n   - Since the condition for toves not burbling is not met, it is possible for all toves to burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the statements must be true given the conditions.

It is not the case that Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Bungo. This means Rafin did snicker-snack Bungo.\n5. Bungo isn't a borogove just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nLet's break down the implications:\n\n- Since Rafin is a tove and Rafin snicker-snacked Bungo, we know that at least one tove (Rafin) snicker-snacked Bungo. This makes statement 5 (\"A tove snicker-snacked Bungo\") true.\n\n- Statement 4 (\"Not all toves snicker-snacked Bungo\") is also true because we only know that Rafin, a specific tove, snicker-snacked Bungo. We have no information about other toves, so we cannot conclude that all toves snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n- Statement 3 (\"No toves snicker-snacked Bungo\") is false because Rafin, a tove, did snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n- Statement 2 (\"Every tove snicker-snacked Bungo\") is false because we only know about Rafin, and we have no information about other toves.\n\n- Statement 1 (\"Bungo snicker-snacked every tove\") and Statement 6 (\"Bungo snicker-snacked a tove\") are not supported by the information given. We have no evidence that Bungo snicker-snacked any tove.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are:\n\n5. A tove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n4. Not all toves snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\nFinal answer: Statements 5 and 4 must be true.",

It can be broken down as follows:\n     - If Rafin won't whiffle, then the statement \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" is true only if \"no raths galumphed over Bungo\" is true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - There is no information provided about Rafin snicker-snacking anyone, so this cannot be determined as true.\n\n2. **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This statement is directly related to the conditional statement given: \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then this statement must be true. However, we don't have enough information to confirm that a borogove did snicker-snack Rafin, so this cannot be determined as true.\n\n3. **A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This statement is the antecedent of the conditional statement. If this were true, then \"not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" would also be true. However, we don't have enough information to confirm this, so it cannot be determined as true.\n\n4. **Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - If this were true, it would contradict the conditional statement \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This is a possibility, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. It does not contradict any given conditions, but it cannot be determined as true without further information.\n\n6. **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - There is no information provided about Rafin snicker-snacking anyone, so this cannot be determined as true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n4. **Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.** (This must be false, as it contradicts the conditional statement.)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that statement 4 must be false.",

It is not the case that Rafin is a tove.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n   - We know Zindle and Bungo are mimsy, but we have no information linking being mimsy to whiffling. Also, not all toves will whiffle, and we don't know if Zindle or Bungo are toves. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - Similar to the reasoning above, we have no information that directly links Zindle being mimsy to whiffling. This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **Zindle won't whiffle.**\n   - Again, we have no information that directly links Zindle being mimsy to not whiffling. This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Not all toves will whiffle and Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - We know that not all toves will whiffle, but we are explicitly told that Zindle is mimsy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Not all toves will whiffle but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - We know that not all toves will whiffle, and we are told that Zindle is mimsy. Therefore, it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy. This statement is true.\n\n6. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - We have no information about Rafin's ability to whiffle, and we cannot conclude anything about Zindle's ability to whiffle. This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n5. Not all toves will whiffle but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.",

It can be rewritten as: If all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then some borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n4. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and only toves gimbled.**\n   - Some toves did not snicker-snack Zindle, and only toves have the ability to gimble.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Zindle and Rafin gimbled.**\n   - Only toves can gimble. For Zindle and Rafin to both gimble, they must both be toves. However, we don't have enough information to confirm that both are toves. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A borogove is uffish just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know all borogoves are uffish.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo gimbled.**\n   - Only toves can gimble. We don't have enough information to confirm that both Zindle and Bungo are toves. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle didn't gimble.**\n   - Since only toves can gimble and not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, it is possible that Zindle is not a tove and therefore didn't gimble.

Since borogoves burble, they cannot be mimsy.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - If no borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, which would mean no borogoves are mimsy. Since only toves are mimsy, this is consistent. However, we need to check if a borogove must snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n2. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - If no borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, which means no borogoves are mimsy. This is consistent with the condition that only toves are mimsy.\n\n3. **Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - The problem does not provide information about Rafin's actions, only about entities snicker-snacking Rafin.\n\n4. **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - If not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then no borogoves are mimsy. This is consistent with the condition that only toves are mimsy.\n\n5. **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - Again, the problem does not provide information about Rafin's actions.\n\n6. **Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - If every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then the condition \"no borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" does not apply, and borogoves could potentially be mimsy. However, since only toves are mimsy, this creates a contradiction unless no borogoves are mimsy regardless of whether they snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nGiven the conditions, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n\nThis is because if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then no borogoves are mimsy, which is consistent with the condition that only toves are mimsy. If all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, it would create a contradiction with the condition that only toves are mimsy. Therefore, not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin must be true.",

Not all borogoves galumphed over Zindle just in case no raths chortled at Rafin.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1.

This does not imply that a tove snicker-snacked a rath, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. A rath snicker-snacked every tove.\n   - This is directly stated in the problem: \"Every rath snicker-snacked every tove.\" Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n   - The problem does not provide information that supports this statement. It only states that every rath snicker-snacked every tove, not the other way around. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n   - Similar to statement 3, there is no information to support that any tove snicker-snacked every rath. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. No toves snicker-snacked every rath.\n   - The problem does not provide information to confirm or deny this statement. It is possible that some toves snicker-snacked some raths, but we cannot conclude that no toves snicker-snacked every rath. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n   - The problem does not provide information to support this statement. It only states that every rath snicker-snacked every tove, not that every tove snicker-snacked a rath.

Rafin did not chortle at Bungo.\n\n3. **Every borogove is mimsy if and only if not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement. If every borogove is mimsy, then not all borogoves chortled at Bungo, and vice versa.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't mimsy but it is not the case that Bungo is a rath.**\n   - Zindle is not mimsy, and Bungo is not a rath.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **Zindle isn't mimsy but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know Zindle isn't mimsy. The phrase \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" means Rafin did chortle at Bungo. This contradicts the given condition that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.

This statement is consistent with the given conditions and must be true.\n\n3. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.**\n   - We know Zindle isn't mimsy, so this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Rafin is mimsy.**\n   - There is no information given about Rafin being mimsy or not. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are mimsy.**\n   - We know Zindle isn't mimsy, so this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - We know Zindle isn't mimsy, so this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n2.

Therefore, statement 5 is false.\n\n- **Statement 6: Rafin isn't a rath.**\n  - From the analysis above, Rafin cannot be a rath because not all raths galumphed over Rafin. Therefore, statement 6 is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of the conditional statement:\n\n- **If Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n  - Since Rafin is not a rath, the condition about Rafin not snicker-snacking Rafin doesn't directly affect the truth of other statements about Zindle or Bungo being mimsy.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the only statement that must be true based on the provided conditions is:\n\n**6. Rafin isn't a rath.**",

There is at least one entity in each category.\n\n2. **Bungo and Rafin are uffish.**\n   - This statement doesn't directly relate to the categories of tove, borogove, or rath, but it might be relevant to the galumphing conditions.\n\n3. **No raths galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This is a crucial condition. It explicitly states that no rath can galumph over another rath.\n\n4. **A rath galumphed over Rafin or a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - This condition indicates that at least one rath galumphed over either Rafin or Zindle. It doesn't specify which one, but at least one of these events must occur.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **There is a rath that every rath galumphed over.**\n   - Given that no rath galumphed over a rath, this statement cannot be true. There cannot be a rath that every rath galumphed over because no rath galumphed over any rath.\n\n2. **A rath galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This directly contradicts the condition that no rath galumphed over a rath.

We know a borogove is uffish, and it is explicitly stated that not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n     - Therefore, Statement 1 must be true.\n\n   - **Statement 2:** \"A borogove is uffish and no toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n     - While we know a borogove is uffish, the information only states that not all toves chortled at Bungo, not that no toves did. Therefore, Statement 2 is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 3:** \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo and every borogove is uffish.\"\n     - We know not all toves chortled at Bungo, and it is given that a borogove is uffish. However, the statement \"every borogove is uffish\" is not explicitly confirmed by the given information. Therefore, Statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 4:** \"Every tove is uffish unless every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n     - There is no information about toves being uffish or about borogoves chortling at Bungo. This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n   - **Statement 5:** \"Every tove is uffish or every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n     - Similar to Statement 4, there is no information to support either part of this disjunction. Therefore, Statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 6:** \"Every borogove is uffish and no toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n     - While a borogove is uffish, we do not have information confirming that every borogove is uffish or that no toves chortled at Bungo.

If Zindle were a rath, it would imply Zindle snicker-snacked itself, which contradicts the statement \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.\" Therefore, Zindle cannot be a rath.\n\n2. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - We need to determine if Zindle being mimsy is a necessary condition. The problem doesn't provide direct information about Zindle being mimsy or not. We need to explore other statements to see if this can be inferred.\n\n3. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, we don't have direct information about Bungo being mimsy. Without additional information, we cannot conclude that both Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - This is the negation of statement 2. We need to determine if Zindle not being mimsy is a necessary condition. Again, the problem doesn't provide direct information about Zindle's mimsy status.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are mimsy.**\n   - We know Rafin isn't uffish, but we don't have direct information about Rafin being mimsy. Without additional information, we cannot conclude that both Zindle and Rafin are mimsy.\n\n6. **Zindle isn't a rath.**\n   - From our analysis of statement 1, we concluded that Zindle cannot be a rath because it would contradict the condition that Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.

If a rath R galumphs over a tove T, then T must also galumph over R.\n\n3. **A rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This suggests a chain of snicker-snacking among raths, but it doesn't directly affect the galumphing relationships.\n\n4. **If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This condition is a bit more complex, but it essentially sets a condition on Bungo's galumphing behavior based on the snicker-snacking of raths.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No toves galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This would contradict the condition that every rath galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.

The conditions do not preclude the possibility of a tove galumphing over every rath.\n\n4. **A tove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The conditions only require that for each rath, there is a tove that it galumphs over and vice versa, but not that a single tove galumphs over every rath.\n\n5. **Every tove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The conditions do not require such a universal galumphing relationship.\n\n6. **Every tove galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This is consistent with the condition that every rath galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.

If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo is beamish.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No toves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This statement cannot be true because Bungo snicker-snacked every tove, which implies interaction. The problem does not provide information about toves snicker-snacking Bungo, so this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - The problem does not provide information about toves snicker-snacking Bungo, only that Bungo snicker-snacked every tove. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as true.\n\n3. **Bungo snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - This statement must be true because it is explicitly stated that Bungo snicker-snacked every tove.

According to the conditional statement, if not all toves chortled at Bungo, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo is beamish.

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - The conditions do not specify that any tove galumphed over every borogove, only that every tove galumphed over a specific borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - The conditions only guarantee that every tove galumphed over a specific borogove, not every borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - This is consistent with condition 2, which states there is a borogove that every tove galumphed over. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Not all toves will whiffle and every tove will whiffle.**\n   - There is no information about toves whiffling, so this statement cannot be determined to be true or false based on the given conditions.\n\n6. **No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - This is consistent with the conditions, as there is no requirement for any tove to galumph over every borogove. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n4. Every tove galumphed over a borogove.\n6. No toves galumphed over every borogove.\n\nFinal answer: Statements 4 and 6 must be true.",

It implies a sort of circular or chain relationship among toves. If a tove A galumphs over tove B, then B must galumph over some tove C, and so on, eventually leading back to A or another tove that completes the chain.\n\n4. **If Rafin is a tove, then every rath galumphed over Rafin only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.**  \n   This condition is conditional and doesn't directly affect the relationships among toves unless Rafin and Bungo are specified as toves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **There is a tove that every tove galumphed over.**  \n   This would imply a hierarchy or a single tove at the bottom of a chain, but the condition \"Every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it\" suggests a circular or chain relationship, not a hierarchy. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily hold true.\n\n2. **Every tove galumphed over every tove.**  \n   This is not possible because it contradicts the condition that every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it, which implies a chain or cycle, not a complete graph where every tove galumphs over every other tove.\n\n3. **No toves galumphed over every tove.**  \n   This is consistent with the condition that every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it, as it implies a cycle or chain rather than a complete graph. This statement must be true.\n\n4. **A tove galumphed over a tove.**  \n   This is directly supported by the condition \"Every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **A tove galumphed over every tove.**  \n   This would imply a hierarchy or a single tove at the top, which contradicts the cycle or chain relationship.

A rath is uffish.\n3. No toves chortled at Bungo.\n4. A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n5. Every tove gyred.\n6. Only toves gyred or every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n\nLet's break down the implications:\n\n- Since every tove gyred, if Zindle gyred, then Zindle must be a tove.\n- If Zindle didn't gyre, then Zindle is either a borogove or a rath.\n- A rath galumphed over Zindle, which means Zindle is not a rath (since a rath can't galumph over itself).\n- Therefore, if Zindle didn't gyre, Zindle must be a borogove.\n- The statement \"Only toves gyred or every tove galumphed over Rafin\" implies that if any non-tove gyred, then every tove must have galumphed over Rafin.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. Zindle and Rafin gyred.\n   - If Zindle gyred, Zindle is a tove. If Rafin gyred, Rafin is also a tove. This is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n2. Zindle and Bungo gyred.\n   - If Zindle gyred, Zindle is a tove. If Bungo gyred, Bungo is also a tove. This is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n3. Zindle didn't gyre.\n   - If Zindle didn't gyre, Zindle is a borogove. This is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n4. Zindle gyred.\n   - If Zindle gyred, Zindle is a tove. This is possible but not necessarily true.\n\n5. Zindle is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n   - Zindle cannot be uffish because Zindle is not a rath (a rath galumphed over Zindle). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. A rath is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n   - This statement is consistent with the given conditions: a rath is uffish, and a rath galumphed over Zindle.

No toves will burble just in case a borogove is mimsy.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n- Condition 3 and 4 can be combined: A borogove is uffish if and only if no toves will burble, and no toves will burble just in case a borogove is mimsy. This implies that a borogove is uffish if and only if a borogove is mimsy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A borogove is uffish just in case a borogove is mimsy.**\n\n   This statement directly follows from the combined condition derived above. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Zindle will burble.**\n\n   We know Zindle is mimsy, but we have no information about whether Zindle will burble. The conditions do not provide any direct link between being mimsy and burbling for Zindle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A borogove is uffish just in case every borogove is mimsy.**\n\n   The condition states \"a borogove is uffish if and only if a borogove is mimsy,\" which does not imply that every borogove must be mimsy. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Zindle won't burble.**\n\n   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about whether Zindle will burble. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n\n   Again, we have no information about whether Zindle or Rafin will burble. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A borogove is uffish just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n\n   This statement contradicts the derived condition that a borogove is uffish if and only if a borogove is mimsy. Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n1. A borogove is uffish just in case a borogove is mimsy.\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 1 must be true.",

The conditions do not provide enough information to conclude that no tove galumphed over every borogove.\n\n4. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true.

However, we need to consider the possibility of Zindle being a tove.\n\n- If Zindle is a tove, then the borogove that chortled at Rafin must be someone else, possibly Bungo, since Bungo chortled at Bungo and could also chortle at Rafin.\n\n- Since Zindle isn't a rath, statement 5 (\"Zindle is a rath\") is false.\n\n- Since Zindle could be a borogove or a tove, we cannot definitively conclude that Zindle is a borogove or isn't a borogove, making statements 3 (\"Zindle is a borogove\") and 6 (\"Zindle isn't a borogove\") not necessarily true.\n\n- Regarding Rafin, since a borogove chortled at Rafin, Rafin could be a tove or a rath.

Not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - For Zindle to be beamish, Zindle must be a borogove (since only borogoves are beamish). However, we don't have enough information to determine if Zindle is a borogove.\n\n2. **Only borogoves are beamish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This statement is consistent with the given conditions. Only borogoves are beamish (condition 3), and no toves galumphed over Bungo (condition 5). This statement must be true.\n\n3. **If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - Bungo can only be beamish if Bungo is a borogove. If Bungo is a borogove, then Bungo galumphed over every borogove, including itself. The condition \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish\" is irrelevant because borogoves are beamish by definition. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **If Bungo galumphed over Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - Bungo galumphing over Bungo implies Bungo is a borogove. The condition \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish\" is irrelevant because borogoves are beamish by definition. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - For Zindle and Rafin to be beamish, both must be borogoves. We don't have enough information to determine if both are borogoves. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Not all borogoves are beamish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - All borogoves are beamish by definition (condition 3), so the first part of this statement is false.

The statement \"Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all toves gyred\" implies that Rafin chortled at Rafin if and only if not all toves gyred.

This is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n   \n   - **Statement 2:** No borogoves chortled at every borogove.\n     - This statement implies that there is no borogove that chortled at every other borogove. This is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n   \n   - **Statement 3:** A borogove chortled at a borogove.\n     - This statement implies that there is at least one borogove that chortled at another borogove. This is consistent with the given information that every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n   \n   - **Statement 4:** Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\n     - This statement implies that all borogoves chortled at all other borogoves. This is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n   \n   - **Statement 5:** A borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.\n     - This statement is directly supported by the given information that every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n   \n   - **Statement 6:** Every borogove chortled at a borogove.\n     - This statement implies that each borogove chortled at least one other borogove.

Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n- From condition 2, \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle,\" we can infer that at least one tove snicker-snacked Zindle because there is at least one tove.\n\n- Condition 4, \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle,\" is a bit tricky. The phrase \"just in case\" can be interpreted as \"if and only if.\" Therefore, this condition can be rephrased as: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This creates a contradiction because if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, which is consistent. However, if at least one tove snicker-snacked Zindle (which we know is true from condition 2), then the statement \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" cannot be true. Therefore, this condition implies that all toves must have snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n- From condition 3, \"Zindle gyred unless Zindle isn't a borogove,\" we can infer that Zindle gyred if Zindle is a borogove. However, we don't have enough information to determine if Zindle is a borogove or not.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. Zindle snicker-snacked a tove.\n   - We have no information about Zindle snicker-snacking a tove. The conditions only mention toves snicker-snacking Zindle.\n\n2. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   - This is false because, from our analysis, all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n3. Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.\n   - We have no information about Zindle snicker-snacking any toves.\n\n4. Zindle gyred.\n   - We cannot determine this because we don't know if Zindle is a borogove.\n\n5. No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   - This is false because all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n6. A tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   - This is true because all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, so at least one tove did.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n6.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. \"Zindle is beamish.\"\n   - As previously discussed, Zindle can only be beamish if Zindle is a borogove. We don't have enough information to determine if Zindle is a borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. \"Zindle and Rafin are beamish.\"\n   - Similar to the reasoning for statement 5, we don't have enough information to determine if Zindle is a borogove. Additionally, we have no information about Rafin being beamish. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 1 is the only statement that must be true.",

Bungo's ability to whiffle is also not directly addressed. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - Again, we have no information about Zindle's ability to whiffle. Rafin's ability to whiffle is not directly addressed in the conditions. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n3. **A borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.**\n   - This statement is directly supported by the given information: \"A borogove is uffish\" and \"A borogove will whiffle.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Zindle won't whiffle.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle's ability to whiffle. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - As with statement 4, we have no information about Zindle's ability to whiffle. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Every borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.**\n   - This statement is essentially the same as statement 3, just phrased differently.

Since Rafin isn't a tove, it must be true that no toves galumphed over Zindle.\n\n5. **A rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - If a rath performs the action \"snicker-snacked\" on Bungo, then Bungo must be a borogove.\n\n6. **If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This is a conditional statement with a nested condition. If a borogove performs the action \"snicker-snacked\" on Rafin, then the statement \"Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin\" is true only if not all toves perform the action \"galumphed\" over Bungo.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Every tove galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - This cannot be true because we established that no toves galumphed over Zindle.\n\n2. **A tove galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - This cannot be true because no toves galumphed over Zindle.\n\n3. **Zindle galumphed over every tove.**\n   - There is no information to support or refute this statement.\n\n4. **Zindle galumphed over a tove.**\n   - There is no information to support or refute this statement.\n\n5. **No toves galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - This must be true based on the disjunction condition and the fact that Rafin is not a tove.\n\n6. **Not all toves will whiffle and every tove will whiffle.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n5. **No toves galumphed over Zindle.**",

Either there is a borogove that galumphed over Rafin, or every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n5. **Not all toves will burble or a rath will burble.**\n   - This is another disjunction. Either there is at least one tove that will not burble, or there is a rath that will burble.\n\n6. **A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if not all toves gimbled.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement. A borogove chortling at Zindle is equivalent to the condition that not all toves gimbled.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - There is no information supporting that a tove snicker-snacked every borogove. The given condition is about borogoves snicker-snacking toves, not the other way around.\n\n2. **A borogove snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - This must be true because the condition states that a borogove snicker-snacked every tove.

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Bungo isn't a borogove if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement. Since we have established that every borogove chortled at Bungo, the second part of the biconditional is true.

There is no guarantee that every tove will be snicker-snacked by a borogove.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true for the same reason as statement 1. There is no requirement for a tove to snicker-snack every borogove unconditionally.\n\n4. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.**\n   - This statement is true. The condition explicitly states that every tove snicker-snacks every borogove that snicker-snacks it.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.

The rules do not require every tove to snicker-snack every borogove, only those that snicker-snack every tove.\n\n2. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The rules do not prevent a tove from snicker-snacking every borogove.\n\n3. **No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**  \n   This is false because the problem states that a rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked a borogove, so at least one tove did snicker-snack a borogove.\n\n4. **No borogoves snicker-snacked every tove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The rules do not prevent a borogove from snicker-snacking every tove.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The rules do not require any tove to snicker-snack every borogove.\n\n6. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The rules do not require every tove to snicker-snack a borogove, only that at least one tove did.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true given the conditions is:\n\n**3. No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.** (This is false, as explained, but the problem requires identifying which must be true, and none of the statements are universally true based on the given conditions.)\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that none of the provided statements must be true in every possible scenario described by the problem.",

However, the condition \"Every rath chortled at a rath that chortled at it\" implies some form of mutual chortling, but it doesn't necessarily mean every rath chortled at every other rath. This statement could be true, but it doesn't have to be true based on the given conditions.\n\n2. **There is a rath that every rath chortled at.**\n   - This statement suggests the existence of a rath that is chortled at by all other raths.

It could be possible, but it's not a necessity.\n\n3. **A rath chortled at a rath.**\n   - The condition \"Every rath chortled at a rath that chortled at it\" directly implies that at least one rath chortled at another rath. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **No raths chortled at a rath.**\n   - This statement contradicts the condition \"Every rath chortled at a rath that chortled at it.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **A rath chortled at every rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is a rath that chortled at all other raths.

It is not the case that Zindle is uffish.\n5. If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\nLet's break down the implications:\n\n- From statement 2, we know that if something is a borogove, it must be uffish.\n- From statement 4, we know Zindle is not uffish. Therefore, Zindle cannot be a borogove (since all borogoves are uffish).\n- Since Zindle is not a borogove, Zindle must be either a tove or a rath.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditional statement 5:\n\n- If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\nThis statement is a bit complex, but let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If Zindle is a tove, then the condition \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is relevant. However, we know from statement 3 that no toves galumphed over Bungo, which means that if Zindle is a tove, the condition \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is trivially true because no toves galumphed over Bungo at all.\n\n- If Zindle is a rath, the condition about toves doesn't directly apply to Zindle, but the statement still holds because it doesn't contradict any known facts.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n1. Rafin is uffish.\n   - We have no information about Rafin being uffish or not. This cannot be concluded.\n\n2. Zindle and Rafin are uffish.\n   - We know Zindle is not uffish, so this statement is false.\n\n3. Zindle and Bungo are uffish.\n   - We know Zindle is not uffish, so this statement is false.\n\n4. Zindle is a borogove.\n   - We know Zindle is not uffish, so Zindle cannot be a borogove. This statement is false.\n\n5.

This implies Bungo is not a borogove, as Bungo chortled at Zindle, and only borogoves will whiffle.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n   - We don't have information about toves chortling at Bungo or Rafin chortling at Zindle, so this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n2.

Therefore, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't beamish but it is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish.**\n   - Zindle is not beamish. The second part, \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish,\" means Rafin is beamish.\n\nFrom these conditions, let's deduce the possible categories for each entity:\n\n- **Rafin**: \n  - Rafin is not a tove (from condition 3).\n  - Rafin is beamish (from condition 4).\n  - Since a rath is beamish, Rafin must be a rath.\n\n- **Zindle**:\n  - Zindle is not beamish (from condition 4).\n  - Since a rath is beamish, Zindle cannot be a rath.\n  - Therefore, Zindle must be either a tove or a borogove.\n\n- **Bungo**:\n  - We need to determine Bungo's category based on the conditions.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\n2. **Bungo isn't a borogove.**\n   - If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Rafin is not a tove (which is already true). This statement is consistent with the conditions but not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - This is false because Zindle isn't beamish.\n\n4. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - This is false because Zindle isn't beamish.\n\n5. **Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\n6. **Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - If Bungo is a borogove, it doesn't affect the truth of any other statements negatively.

If a tove A snicker-snacks a tove B, then B must snicker-snack A.\n\n4. **Only borogoves are beamish and every borogove is uffish.**  \n   This provides information about borogoves but doesn't directly relate to snicker-snacking.\n\n5. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**  \n   This is a logical equivalence: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true if and only if \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true. This implies that either all toves snicker-snack Zindle or none do.\n\n6. **If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.**  \n   This is a conditional statement involving borogoves, raths, and Bungo, but it doesn't directly affect the snicker-snacking among toves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **A tove snicker-snacked a tove.**  \n   Given that every tove snicker-snacks every tove that snicker-snacks it, if there is at least one tove, it must snicker-snack itself to satisfy this condition. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **A tove snicker-snacked every tove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The condition only states mutual snicker-snacking, not that one tove snicker-snacks all others.\n\n3. **No toves snicker-snacked every tove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The condition allows for the possibility of mutual snicker-snacking, but it doesn't preclude a tove from snicker-snacking every other tove.\n\n4. **Every tove snicker-snacked a tove.**  \n   This must be true because if a tove snicker-snacks another tove, the other tove must snicker-snack it back, ensuring every tove snicker-snacks at least one tove (itself or another).\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.**  \n   This is directly stated in the conditions, so it must be true.\n\n6. **Every tove snicker-snacked every tove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The conditions only require mutual snicker-snacking, not universal snicker-snacking among all toves.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1.

Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Rafin is a tove unless Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n   - This implies that if Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then Rafin is not a tove. However, we have no information about Zindle chortling at Rafin, so this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n2. **Rafin is a tove or Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n   - This is a disjunction. We know Rafin cannot be a tove because no toves chortled at Rafin, and Rafin chortled at Zindle. Therefore, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath. Since Rafin is not a tove, the statement \"Rafin is a tove or Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin\" is true because the first part of the disjunction is false, leaving the second part undetermined but not affecting the truth of the disjunction.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This statement is directly supported by the given information. No toves chortled at Rafin, and Rafin did chortle at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Rafin chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Rafin is a tove or it is not the case that Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n   - Since Rafin cannot be a tove, the first part of the disjunction is false. However, the second part \"it is not the case that Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin\" is undetermined, but the disjunction can still be true if the second part is true. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **If Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle, then a tove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. We know no toves chortled at Rafin, so the conclusion of the conditional is false. For the conditional to be true, the antecedent (Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle) must also be false. However, we have no information about Zindle chortling at Zindle, so this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 2: Rafin is a tove or Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.\n- Statement 3: No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that statements 2 and 3 must be true.",

In other words, for any tove, there exists at least one tove that did not snicker-snack it.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked every borogove.**  \n   This is a bit complex. Let's break it down:\n   - If a tove snicker-snacks every borogove, then every other tove must snicker-snack that tove.\n   - This implies that if there exists a tove that snicker-snacks every borogove, then all toves must snicker-snack that particular tove.\n\n4. **Not all raths will whiffle but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.**  \n   The first part about raths is not directly relevant to the snicker-snacking logic.

If a rath A snicker-snacks a rath B, then B also snicker-snacks A.\n\n3. **A rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This indicates a chain of snicker-snacking: a rath snicker-snacks a tove, and that tove snicker-snacks a borogove.\n\n4. **If every borogove is mimsy, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This conditional statement involves Zindle, Bungo, and the galumphing of toves. However, it doesn't directly affect the snicker-snacking relationships.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No raths snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - The information doesn't support this. It only states mutual snicker-snacking between pairs, not that one rath snicker-snacks all others. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **There is a rath that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n   - The information doesn't imply the existence of a single rath that is snicker-snacked by all others.

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. \"Every borogove will whiffle.\"\n   - This statement contradicts the given information that no borogoves will whiffle. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. \"A borogove will whiffle.\"\n   - This statement also contradicts the given information that no borogoves will whiffle. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. \"Not all borogoves will whiffle.\"\n   - This statement is consistent with the given information that no borogoves will whiffle. If no borogoves whiffle, then it is true that not all borogoves whiffle. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. \"Only borogoves will whiffle.\"\n   - This statement implies that if anything whiffles, it must be a borogove. However, since no borogoves will whiffle, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. \"Only borogoves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.\"\n   - This statement is similar to statement 1 in that it is contradictory. If only borogoves will whiffle, then some borogoves must whiffle. However, it also states that not all borogoves will whiffle, which is consistent with some borogoves whiffling, but contradicts the given information that no borogoves will whiffle. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n4. Not all borogoves will whiffle.",

Conversely, if something is not a tove, it cannot be beamish.\n\n3. **Not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - This tells us that at least one borogove did not galumph over Rafin.\n\n4. **Bungo isn't a borogove only if every tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is a conditional statement: If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Bungo is a borogove.\n\n5. **If a tove galumphed over Bungo, then Zindle isn't a borogove.**\n   - This is another conditional statement: If a tove galumphed over Bungo, Zindle cannot be a borogove.\n\n6. **A rath galumphed over Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.**\n   - This tells us two things: A rath galumphed over Zindle, and Rafin is not a tove.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - For both to be beamish, both must be toves. However, Rafin is not a tove (from statement 6), so this cannot be true.\n\n2. **Rafin isn't beamish.**\n   - Since Rafin is not a tove (from statement 6), and only toves are beamish, Rafin cannot be beamish. This statement must be true.\n\n3. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - For Zindle to be beamish, Zindle must be a tove. However, we know a rath galumphed over Zindle, and we have no information confirming Zindle is a tove. This statement cannot be determined to be true.\n\n4. **Rafin is beamish.**\n   - As established, Rafin is not a tove, so Rafin cannot be beamish.

There is at least one entity in each category.\n\n2. **Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.**\n   - This implies a mutual relationship between raths: if a rath A snicker-snacks a rath B, then B also snicker-snacks A.\n\n3. **A borogove is uffish and a rath is uffish.**\n   - This tells us that both borogoves and raths share the property of being uffish. Toves are not mentioned in this context.\n\n4. **Bungo chortled at Bungo and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - These statements provide additional context but do not directly affect the logical relationships concerning snicker-snacking.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Every rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that each rath has snicker-snacked at least one other rath. The given information does not guarantee this, as it only states mutual snicker-snacking if it occurs. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is at least one rath that has snicker-snacked all other raths. The given information does not support this, as it only describes mutual snicker-snacking. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is at least one instance of a rath snicker-snacking another rath. The given information about mutual snicker-snacking implies that if any snicker-snacking occurs, it is mutual. Therefore, this statement must be true because the existence of mutual snicker-snacking implies at least one instance of a rath snicker-snacking another rath.\n\n4. **Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that all raths have snicker-snacked all other raths. The given information does not support this, as it only describes mutual snicker-snacking if it occurs. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is no rath that has snicker-snacked all other raths. The given information does not support this, as it only describes mutual snicker-snacking if it occurs. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.**\n   - This statement is directly supported by the given information, which states that every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statements that must be true are:\n3. A rath snicker-snacked a rath.\n6. A rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.",

Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n3. Zindle will burble.\n   - Similar to the reasoning above, if Zindle is a borogove, Zindle will not burble. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n4.

However, \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\" implies Bungo did snicker-snack Zindle, which contradicts the given information.

Every rath chortled at Zindle.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **A rath snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know from the situation that a rath snicker-snacked Zindle. However, it is explicitly stated that Rafin chortled at Bungo, so \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is false. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - The situation states that a rath snicker-snacked Zindle, but it does not say that every rath did. Therefore, the first part of this statement is not necessarily true. However, \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is true because Rafin did chortle at Bungo. Since the first part is not necessarily true, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - As analyzed in statement 2, we do not have information that every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, and we know Rafin did chortle at Bungo. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **A rath snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know a rath snicker-snacked Zindle, and \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is true because Rafin did chortle at Bungo. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This statement is a bit complex. We don't have information about Zindle chortling at Rafin or about raths snicker-snacking Bungo. The conditional structure makes it difficult to determine its truth without additional information. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Bungo just in case no raths chortled at Rafin.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle snicker-snacking Bungo or about raths chortling at Rafin.

It suggests that if a tove is not uffish, then every tove must have galumphed over Rafin. However, it doesn't directly affect the relationship between toves and borogoves.\n\n4. **Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - This condition relates to borogoves and Rafin, not directly to the relationship between toves and borogoves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - This must be true because we know from condition 2 that a tove galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, a tove must have galumphed over at least one borogove.\n\n2. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The condition only states that a tove (at least one) galumphed over every borogove, not that every tove did.\n\n3. **No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - This is false because we know from condition 2 that at least one tove did galumph over every borogove.\n\n4. **No toves galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - This is false because we know from condition 2 that a tove galumphed over every borogove.\n\n5. **There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The conditions do not provide any information about borogoves galumphing over toves.\n\n6. **Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true.

Since we know not all raths whiffle, it follows that not every tove is uffish.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't a borogove unless no toves are uffish.**\n   - This is a conditional statement: If Zindle is a borogove, then no toves are uffish.\n\n5. **If every rath snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is a conditional statement that doesn't directly affect the truth of the other statements unless we know about the raths' actions.\n\n6. **If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin is a tove only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is another conditional statement that doesn't directly affect the truth of the other statements unless we know about the raths' actions.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\n2. **Every tove is uffish.**\n   - This contradicts the conclusion from condition 3 that not every tove is uffish.\n\n3. **No toves are uffish.**\n   - This would mean Zindle isn't a borogove, but we don't have enough information to conclude this must be true.\n\n4. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle's ability to whiffle, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n5. **Not all toves are uffish.**\n   - This is consistent with the conclusion from condition 3 and must be true.\n\n6. **Only toves are uffish.**\n   - This is not necessarily true, as we only know that not all toves are uffish.\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n5. **Not all toves are uffish.**",

A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n6. A rath chortled at Zindle only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nLet's analyze the implications:\n\n- From condition 3, every rath chortled at Zindle. This means Zindle cannot be a tove because no toves chortled at Rafin, and if Zindle were a tove, it would contradict the exclusivity of categories since a rath must chortle at Zindle.\n\n- From condition 6, a rath chortled at Zindle only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin. Since every rath chortled at Zindle (condition 3), it follows that Rafin must have snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. Zindle isn't a tove.\n   - This must be true because if Zindle were a tove, it would contradict the fact that every rath chortled at Zindle, and no toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n2. Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.\n   - This is false because, from our analysis, Rafin must have snicker-snacked Rafin for a rath to chortle at Zindle.\n\n3. Rafin is a tove.\n   - This is not necessarily true. We only know that Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, but this doesn't determine Rafin's category.\n\n4. Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n   - This must be true, as deduced from condition 6 and the fact that every rath chortled at Zindle.\n\n5. Zindle is a tove.\n   - This is false because Zindle cannot be a tove, as established in statement 1.\n\n6. Rafin isn't a tove.\n   - This is not necessarily true. We have no information that directly determines Rafin's category.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1. Zindle isn't a tove.\n4. Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nFinal answer: Statements 1 and 4 must be true.",

The statement \"Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove\" can only be true if Bungo is indeed a borogove.\n\n5. **Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" Therefore, Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Bungo chortled at every rath.**\n   - There is no information given that supports Bungo chortling at any rath, so this statement cannot be determined to be true.\n\n4. **Bungo chortled at a rath.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, there is no information to support this, so it cannot be determined to be true.\n\n5. **Not all raths chortled at Bungo.**\n   - The problem states that a rath chortled at every borogove, including Bungo. However, it does not specify that all raths chortled at every borogove, so this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Every rath chortled at Bungo.**\n   - The problem does not specify that every rath chortled at every borogove, only that a rath chortled at every borogove.

If Rafin is a rath and didn't snicker-snack itself, then the condition about raths and borogoves applies.\n\n6. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Bungo chortled at Zindle.**  \n   This implies that there is at least one tove that did not snicker-snack Zindle, and Bungo, presumably a borogove or a rath, chortled at Zindle.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The information only guarantees that every tove snicker-snacked at least one specific borogove, not every borogove.\n\n2. **A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**  \n   This must be true because there is a borogove that every tove snicker-snacked, so each tove snicker-snacked at least this borogove.\n\n3. **There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.**  \n   There is no information to support this. The problem only states that every tove snicker-snacked a specific borogove, not the other way around.\n\n4. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The problem does not provide information about whether any tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**  \n   This is false because we know that every tove snicker-snacked at least one borogove.\n\n6. **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**  \n   This is not necessarily true.
