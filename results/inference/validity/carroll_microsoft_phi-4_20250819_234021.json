Therefore, Bungo chortled at at least one rath.

The contrapositive is: \"If all toves are beamish, then all toves chortled at Rafin.\"\n  - This condition doesn't provide direct information about Rafin's identity or actions.\n\n- **Condition 2**: \"If every rath is mimsy, then Rafin is a tove only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\"\n  - This is another conditional statement.

This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - Statement 2 explicitly states that no toves snicker-snacked Rafin. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Rafin snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - There is no information provided that Rafin snicker-snacked anything, let alone a tove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every tove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which says no toves snicker-snacked Rafin. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - Again, this contradicts Statement 2. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Rafin snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - There is no information provided that Rafin snicker-snacked anything, let alone every tove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n2. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n\nThis is directly supported by Statement 2, which states that no toves snicker-snacked Rafin. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n**2. Not all toves snicker-snacked Rafin.**",

Every tove is uffish or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n4. No toves are uffish or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the logical statements:\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Every tove is uffish or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n  - This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the conditions must be true:\n    - Either every tove is uffish.\n    - Or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"No toves are uffish or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n  - This is another logical disjunction:\n    - Either no toves are uffish.\n    - Or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n\nFrom Statements 3 and 4, we can deduce:\n\n- If every tove is uffish, then from Statement 4, \"no toves are uffish\" must be false, which means \"every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" must be true.\n- If no toves are uffish, then from Statement 3, \"every tove is uffish\" must be false, which means \"every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" must be true.\n\nIn both cases, \"every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" must be true. Therefore, we can conclude:\n\n- **Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle** is true.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle being uffish. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - As deduced, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts our deduction. This statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle snicker-snacking a tove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts our deduction. This statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle snicker-snacking every tove.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\n3. Every rath chortled at every tove that chortled at it.\n4. A borogove galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it.\n5. A rath galumphed over every borogove that galumphed over it.\n6. A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if Rafin chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **There is not a borogove that every borogove chortled at.**\n\n   - From condition 2, every borogove chortled at every borogove. This implies that for any borogove \\( B_1 \\), all other borogoves chortled at \\( B_1 \\). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **No borogoves chortled at every borogove.**\n\n   - Again, from condition 2, every borogove chortled at every borogove. This means each borogove chortled at all borogoves, including itself. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **No borogoves chortled at a borogove that chortled at it.**\n\n   - From condition 2, every borogove chortled at every borogove, including itself. Therefore, this statement is false because each borogove chortled at itself.\n\n4. **Zindle is a tove.**\n\n   - Condition 6 states that a borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if Rafin chortled at Bungo. This condition does not provide any information about Zindle's identity as a tove, borogove, or rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n5. **No borogoves chortled at a borogove.**\n\n   - This contradicts condition 2, which states that every borogove chortled at every borogove. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **A borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n\n   - This is directly stated in condition 2. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n6. A borogove chortled at every borogove.",

Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Zindle isn't mimsy** (Statement 6).\n- **A borogove chortled at Rafin** (Statement 4).\n\n#### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - This is directly supported by the given information (Statements 4 and 6). Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin or a borogove is mimsy.**\n   - We know Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle, but we have no information about Zindle chortling at Rafin. We also have no information about whether a borogove is mimsy. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Zindle isn't mimsy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We know Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle. The statement \"only if Zindle chortled at Zindle\" is false, making the implication true regardless of the condition \"if not all borogoves are mimsy.\" However, this is a tautology and doesn't provide new information. It doesn't necessarily have to be true in the context of the problem.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Zindle isn't mimsy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin unless a borogove is mimsy.**\n   - This is equivalent to saying \"If Zindle chortled at Rafin, then a borogove is mimsy.\" We have no information about Zindle chortling at Rafin or a borogove being mimsy.

Since Bungo is a tove, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This is a stronger statement than statement 3. We only know that not all borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, but we cannot conclude that none did.

Since only borogoves are mentioned to chortle (as per the statement \"A borogove chortled at a borogove that chortled at a borogove\"), Bungo must be a borogove. Toves do not chortle; they gimbled.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1: Bungo is a tove.**\n     - This is false because Bungo chortled, and only borogoves chortle.\n   \n   - **Statement 2: Bungo gimbled.**\n     - This is false because only toves gimbled, and Bungo is a borogove.\n   \n   - **Statement 3: Bungo didn't gimble.**\n     - This is true because Bungo is a borogove, and only toves gimbled.\n   \n   - **Statement 4: Bungo won't whiffle.**\n     - We cannot determine this with certainty.

It restates the given information that Bungo chortled at Bungo and only toves gimbled.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 3: Bungo didn't gimble.\n- Statement 6: Bungo chortled at Bungo and only toves gimbled.",

If Zindle gimbled, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if no toves gimbled.\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"Every rath chortled at every rath.\" This implies that for any two raths, say \\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\), \\( R_1 \\) chortled at \\( R_2 \\) and vice versa.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" This implies Bungo is a rath because only raths chortle at each other.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Not all raths will whiffle.\" This means there is at least one rath that does not whiffle.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"If Zindle gimbled, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if no toves gimbled.\" This is a conditional statement that depends on whether Zindle gimbled and whether any toves gimbled.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **No raths chortled at a rath that chortled at it.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which says every rath chortled at every rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **There is not a rath that every rath chortled at.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which implies that every rath chortled at every other rath, including itself. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **No raths chortled at a rath.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which says every rath chortled at every rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **No raths chortled at every rath.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which implies that every rath chortled at every other rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - There is no information given that directly relates Zindle's actions to whiffling. The condition involving Zindle gimbled is complex and does not provide a direct conclusion about Zindle whiffling.

Only borogoves gyred.\n6. Every rath chortled at Zindle.\n7. It is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo (meaning Rafin did chortle at Bungo).\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle and Bungo will burble.**\n   - We know Zindle will burble, but there is no information about Bungo burbling. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A rath chortled at Zindle only if a tove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - We know every rath chortled at Zindle, but no toves chortled at Rafin. The statement is a conditional: \"If a rath chortled at Zindle, then a tove chortled at Rafin.\" Since the antecedent (a rath chortled at Zindle) is true and the consequent (a tove chortled at Rafin) is false, the conditional statement is false. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at Rafin and every rath chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This statement is a conjunction of two facts: \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" and \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" Both parts are given as true in the problem. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Rafin and Bungo will burble.**\n   - We know Rafin will burble, but there is no information about Bungo burbling. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **If a rath chortled at Zindle, then a tove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is the same conditional as statement 2, which we determined to be false. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - We know Zindle will burble, so this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n3. **No toves chortled at Rafin and every rath chortled at Zindle.**",

We know Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo, and we know no borogoves are beamish. However, the statement requires that these two facts are equivalent, which is not necessarily true based on the given information. The fact that Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo is independent of the beamishness of borogoves. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n\n   - We know no borogoves are beamish, but there is no information about Zindle or Rafin being beamish. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n3. **Zindle and Bungo are beamish.**\n\n   - Similar to statement 2, there is no information about Zindle or Bungo being beamish. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n4. **If no borogoves are beamish, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n\n   - We know no borogoves are beamish, but there is no information about Zindle chortling at Zindle or borogoves chortling at Bungo. The statement is complex and involves conditions that are not supported by the given information. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Zindle just in case Bungo isn't beamish.**\n\n   - We know no borogoves are beamish, but there is no information about borogoves chortling at Zindle or Bungo's beamishness. The statement requires a biconditional relationship that is not supported by the given information. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n6. **Zindle is beamish.**\n\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle's beamishness.

If Zindle whiffles, then according to the conditional statement, every rath is beamish only if every borogove chortled at Bungo. Since no borogoves will whiffle, it doesn't directly affect the chortling condition. However, we know Bungo chortled at Zindle, not necessarily at every borogove. Therefore, the condition \\( R \\rightarrow B \\) might not hold if Zindle whiffles, which would make the implication false. Thus, Zindle cannot whiffle, making this statement true.\n\n2. **Zindle isn't beamish and Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We know Zindle isn't beamish, and Bungo chortled at Zindle. Both parts of this statement are true, so this statement is true.\n\n3. **Zindle isn't beamish but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Bungo chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n   - We have established that Zindle won't whiffle, so this statement is false.\n\n5. **Bungo will whiffle.**\n   - There is no information given about Bungo whiffling, so we cannot conclude this must be true. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - As established, Zindle won't whiffle, so this statement is false.\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n1. Zindle won't whiffle.\n2. Zindle isn't beamish and Bungo chortled at Zindle.",

Every tove chortled at Bungo only if a tove chortled at Rafin.\n5. If not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 2**: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This directly tells us that no tove chortled at Rafin.\n\n- **Condition 4**: \"Every tove chortled at Bungo only if a tove chortled at Rafin.\" Since no tove chortled at Rafin (from Condition 2), it follows that not every tove chortled at Bungo. This is because if every tove had chortled at Bungo, then at least one tove would have had to chortle at Rafin, contradicting Condition 2.\n\n- **Condition 5**: \"If not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves chortled at Rafin.\" Since no toves chortled at Rafin (from Condition 2), it is trivially true that not all toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A tove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is false because Condition 2 explicitly states that no toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n2. **Every tove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is false because Condition 2 states that no toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n3. **Not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is true because Condition 2 states that no toves chortled at Rafin, which implies that not all toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n4. **Rafin chortled at a tove.**\n   - There is no information given about Rafin chortling at anything, so we cannot determine if this is true or false.\n\n5. **No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - The first part, \"No toves chortled at Rafin,\" is true. However, we have no information about Rafin's identity (whether Rafin is a tove, borogove, or rath).

Similarly, we have no information about Zindle whiffling. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Rafin gimbled and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - We know Rafin gimbled, and it is explicitly stated that no borogoves will whiffle.

There is not a borogove that every borogove snicker-snacked.\n5. Rafin is a tove unless a rath will burble.\n6. A borogove will burble and Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: Rafin galumphed over Rafin. This implies Rafin is not a rath because a rath cannot galumph over itself (assuming raths cannot interact with themselves in this way).\n\n- **Statement 3**: Every borogove galumphed over Zindle. This means Zindle is not a borogove because a borogove cannot galumph over itself.\n\n- **Statement 4**: There is not a borogove that every borogove snicker-snacked. This implies that not all borogoves snicker-snacked the same borogove, meaning there is at least one borogove that was not snicker-snacked by every other borogove.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Rafin is a tove unless a rath will burble. Since a borogove will burble (from Statement 6), a rath will burble. Therefore, Rafin is not a tove and must be a rath.\n\n- **Statement 6**: A borogove will burble and Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo. This confirms that a borogove can burble, and Bungo is not a borogove because a borogove cannot snicker-snack itself.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From Statement 5, since a rath will burble, Rafin is a rath.\n- From Statement 3, Zindle is not a borogove.\n- From Statement 6, Bungo is not a borogove.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - We know a borogove will burble, but there is no information that Zindle is a borogove. Zindle could be a tove or a rath. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Not all borogoves galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - Statement 3 says every borogove galumphed over Zindle, so this statement is false.\n\n3. **A borogove galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - Statement 3 confirms this is true.\n\n4. **Zindle galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - There is no information supporting this. Zindle could be a tove or a rath, and neither can galumph over a borogove based on the given information. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **No borogoves galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 3, which says every borogove galumphed over Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - There is no information supporting this. Zindle could be a tove or a rath, and neither can galumph over a borogove based on the given information. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n3. **A borogove galumphed over Zindle.**",

This does not imply that a tove galumphed over every tove, just that each tove galumphed over at least one other tove.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"A tove galumphed over a tove.\" This is directly supported by the information that every tove galumphed over a tove. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n- **Statement 1**: \"A tove galumphed over every tove.\" This would mean there exists at least one tove that galumphed over all other toves. The given information does not support this; it only states that each tove galumphed over at least one other tove.\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"No toves galumphed over every tove.\" This is the negation of Statement 1. Since Statement 1 is not necessarily true, Statement 2 could be true, but it is not definitively supported by the given information.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"There is a tove that every tove galumphed over.\" The information does not provide any basis for this statement. It only states that each tove galumphed over at least one other tove, not that there is a specific tove over which all toves galumphed.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Every tove galumphed over every tove.\" This is a stronger condition than what is given. The information only states that each tove galumphed over at least one other tove, not all toves.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"No toves galumphed over a tove.\" This directly contradicts the given information that every tove galumphed over a tove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n5.

If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statements 4 and 5**: \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" and \"No toves chortled at Bungo\" imply that no tove chortled at any borogove (since Bungo is a borogove). Therefore, statements 1, 2, 5, and 6 cannot be true because they all imply that at least one tove chortled at a borogove.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"No toves chortled at a borogove\" is consistent with the given information that no toves chortled at Bungo (a borogove). This statement must be true.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"No toves chortled at every borogove\" is also consistent with the information. Since no toves chortled at Bungo, it follows that no toves chortled at every borogove. This statement must be true as well.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth statements 3 and 4 must be true based on the given conditions.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: tove, borogove, and rath.\n3. Every rath will whiffle or a borogove is mimsy.\n4. Zindle isn't mimsy.\n5. No borogoves will whiffle.\n6. Bungo is a rath.\n7. Every tove will whiffle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Bungo is a rath.**  \n  From statement 6, we know Bungo is a rath.\n\n- **Every rath will whiffle or a borogove is mimsy.**  \n  Since Bungo is a rath, according to this statement, Bungo will whiffle unless a borogove is mimsy. However, we know from statement 5 that no borogoves will whiffle, and since Zindle isn't mimsy (statement 4), it implies that borogoves are not mimsy. Therefore, Bungo must whiffle.\n\n- **Zindle isn't mimsy.**  \n  From statement 4, Zindle isn't mimsy.\n\n- **No borogoves will whiffle.**  \n  This means if Zindle were a borogove, Zindle wouldn't whiffle.\n\n- **Every tove will whiffle.**  \n  If Zindle were a tove, Zindle would whiffle.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n1. **Bungo will whiffle.**  \n   We have established that Bungo, being a rath, must whiffle because borogoves are not mimsy.  \n   **True.**\n\n2. **Zindle isn't mimsy but it is not the case that Bungo is a rath.**  \n   Zindle isn't mimsy, but Bungo is indeed a rath.  \n   **False.**\n\n3. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**  \n   Bungo will whiffle, but we don't have enough information to determine if Zindle will whiffle. Zindle could be a borogove (not whiffling) or a tove (whiffling).  \n   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n4. **Zindle isn't mimsy and Bungo is a rath.**  \n   Both parts of this statement are true.  \n   **True.**\n\n5. **Zindle won't whiffle.**  \n   We don't have enough information to conclude this. Zindle could be a borogove (not whiffling) or a tove (whiffling).  \n   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n6. **Zindle will whiffle.**  \n   As with statement 5, we don't have enough information to conclude this.  \n   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n1.

However, we know that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, meaning at least one did. This statement does not have to be true.\n\n4. **Bungo is uffish just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This aligns with the given information that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. Since Bungo is uffish, this condition is satisfied. This statement must be true.\n\n5. **Bungo isn't uffish.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Bungo is uffish. This statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Zindle isn't uffish.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Zindle is uffish. This statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n4. Bungo is uffish just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.",

Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Entities and Actions:**\n   - Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n   - There is at least one of each: tove, borogove, and rath.\n   - Actions: galumphing, whiffling, chortling.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - No toves galumphed over Bungo.\n   - It is not the case that Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle. (This means Rafin galumphed over Zindle.)\n   - Not all raths galumphed over Rafin.\n   - It is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove. (This means Rafin is a tove.)\n   - Rafin will whiffle unless every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n   - If every rath chortled at Rafin, then not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\n   - If not all toves will whiffle, then Rafin won't whiffle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - Since Rafin is a tove, and no toves galumphed over Bungo, Rafin did not galumph over Bungo. This makes statement 6 true.\n   - Rafin galumphed over Zindle.\n   - Not all raths galumphed over Rafin, so at least one rath did not galumph over Rafin.\n   - Rafin will whiffle unless every tove galumphed over Rafin. Since not all raths galumphed over Rafin, it's possible that not all toves galumphed over Rafin, which means Rafin might not whiffle.\n   - If every rath chortled at Rafin, then not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo. This doesn't directly affect Rafin's actions but provides a condition about borogoves.\n   - If not all toves will whiffle, then Rafin won't whiffle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo. Since no toves galumphed over Bungo, this condition is satisfied, meaning Rafin won't whiffle if not all toves whiffle.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Statement 1: Rafin galumphed over Bungo. (False, as no toves galumphed over Bungo.)\n   - Statement 2: Bungo didn't galumph over Rafin. (No information about Bungo galumphing over Rafin.)\n   - Statement 3: Zindle and Rafin will whiffle. (No definitive information about Zindle whiffling.)\n   - Statement 4: Zindle will whiffle. (No information about Zindle whiffling.)\n   - Statement 5: Bungo galumphed over Rafin. (No information about Bungo galumphing over Rafin.)\n   - Statement 6: Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo. (True, as no toves galumphed over Bungo and Rafin is a tove.)\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true is:\n\n6. Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo.",

The problem only discusses raths snicker-snacking toves.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\"  \n   - There is no information to support this. The problem does not mention toves snicker-snacking raths.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"No toves snicker-snacked every rath.\"  \n   - This is a negation of Statement 4.

Therefore, Bungo must be beamish.\n\n- **Statement 3**: A borogove is uffish if and only if not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. This means:\n  - If a borogove is uffish, then not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n  - If not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then a borogove is uffish.\n\n- **Statement 4**: A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if Bungo isn't beamish. Since no borogoves chortled at Zindle, Bungo must be beamish (as deduced from Statement 2).\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Bungo is uffish.**\n   - We know Bungo is beamish from the analysis above. There is no information directly linking Bungo's uffishness to the given conditions. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle's uffishness. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Bungo isn't beamish.**\n   - We have deduced that Bungo is beamish. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo are uffish.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle's uffishness, and Bungo is beamish, not necessarily uffish. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Bungo is beamish.**\n   - From the analysis of Statement 4, we deduced that Bungo must be beamish. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Zindle isn't uffish.**\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle's uffishness. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n5. **Bungo is beamish.**",

Zindle isn't a borogove unless no borogoves are beamish.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2** tells us that only borogoves are beamish. This means if something is beamish, it must be a borogove. Conversely, if something is not a borogove, it cannot be beamish.\n\n- **Statement 5** tells us Rafin is a tove.\n\n- **Statement 6** is a conditional: Zindle isn't a borogove unless no borogoves are beamish. This can be rewritten as: If there is at least one borogove that is beamish, then Zindle is a borogove.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n1. **Rafin is a tove** (from Statement 5). Since only borogoves are beamish (Statement 2), Rafin cannot be beamish. Therefore, **Statement 1** (\"Rafin is beamish\") is false.\n\n2. **Zindle's Status**:\n   - If there is at least one borogove that is beamish, then Zindle must be a borogove (from the rewritten Statement 6).\n   - If Zindle is a borogove, Zindle could be beamish (since only borogoves are beamish).\n   - If no borogoves are beamish, then Zindle cannot be a borogove, and thus cannot be beamish.\n\n3. **Bungo's Status**:\n   - We don't have direct information about Bungo being a borogove or not. However, if Bungo were beamish, Bungo would have to be a borogove.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Rafin is beamish**: False, as deduced above.\n2. **Zindle and Bungo are beamish**: For this to be true, both Zindle and Bungo must be borogoves. We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n3. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish**: False, because Rafin is not beamish.\n4. **Zindle isn't beamish**: This could be true if no borogoves are beamish, or if Zindle is not a borogove. However, if there is at least one beamish borogove, Zindle could be beamish if Zindle is a borogove.\n5. **Zindle is beamish**: This is only true if Zindle is a borogove and there is at least one beamish borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. Zindle isn't beamish.**\n\nThis is because if there are beamish borogoves, Zindle must be a borogove to be beamish. If there are no beamish borogoves, Zindle cannot be beamish.

Every rath will whiffle or Rafin is a tove.\n5. Not all borogoves will whiffle.\n6. Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: Not all raths galumphed over Rafin. This implies that at least one rath did not galumph over Rafin.\n\n- **Statement 4**: Every rath will whiffle or Rafin is a tove. This is a logical disjunction. If there exists a rath that did not whiffle, then Rafin must be a tove. However, if all raths whiffle, Rafin can be anything.\n\n- **Statement 6**: Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo. This is a direct statement about Rafin's actions.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **A rath galumphed over Rafin or not all raths chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know not all raths galumphed over Rafin, so this statement is true regardless of whether any rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n2. **Bungo chortled at Bungo and not all raths galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - We know not all raths galumphed over Rafin, but we have no information about Bungo chortling at Bungo. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and not all raths galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - We know not all raths galumphed over Rafin, but we have no information about Bungo chortling at Bungo. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - Both parts of this statement are given as true: not all raths galumphed over Rafin, and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and every rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that not all raths galumphed over Rafin. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n4. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No raths galumphed over Bungo.\n3. A rath galumphed over a tove that galumphed over a tove.\n4. Every borogove is uffish.\n5. Rafin isn't a tove.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"No raths galumphed over Bungo.\" This directly tells us that no rath can be involved in galumphing over Bungo. Therefore, any statement suggesting that a rath galumphed over Bungo must be false.\n\n- **Statement 1**: \"Every rath galumphed over Bungo.\" This contradicts the given information that no raths galumphed over Bungo. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"A rath galumphed over Bungo.\" This also contradicts the given information that no raths galumphed over Bungo. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Not all raths galumphed over Bungo.\" This is consistent with the given information that no raths galumphed over Bungo. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Bungo galumphed over a rath.\" There is no information given about Bungo galumphing over anything, so we cannot conclude this statement is true based on the given information.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"Bungo galumphed over every rath.\" Similar to Statement 4, there is no information about Bungo galumphing over anything, so this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"Rafin is uffish.\" Since Rafin isn't a tove (given), Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath. If Rafin is a borogove, then Rafin is uffish (since every borogove is uffish). If Rafin is a rath, we have no information about raths being uffish. However, since Rafin cannot be a tove and must be one of the other two, and given that every borogove is uffish, Rafin being a borogove is a possibility that makes Rafin uffish. Therefore, this statement can be true if Rafin is a borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n3. Not all raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\nAdditionally, statement 6 (\"Rafin is uffish\") can be true if Rafin is a borogove, but it is not necessarily true if Rafin is a rath.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: tove, borogove, and rath.\n3. Rafin or Zindle are mimsy.\n4. Every tove chortled at every borogove.\n5. A borogove chortled at a borogove that chortled at a rath.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **No toves chortled at a borogove.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every tove chortled at every borogove. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **No toves chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This also contradicts the given information that every tove chortled at every borogove. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - This is a logical tautology. \"Every borogove is mimsy\" is equivalent to \"all borogoves are mimsy,\" and \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" is the negation of \"all borogoves are mimsy.\" The statement \"A if and only if B\" is true if both A and B are true or both are false. Here, if every borogove is mimsy, then not all borogoves are mimsy is false, and vice versa. Thus, this statement is always true.\n\n4. **Every tove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - This is consistent with the given information that every tove chortled at every borogove. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **There is a tove that every borogove chortled at.**\n   - The given information does not provide any details about borogoves chortling at toves. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin and every rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - This is a contradiction. \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin\" means at least one rath did not galumph over Rafin, while \"every rath galumphed over Rafin\" means all raths did. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n- **3. Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n- **4. Every tove chortled at a borogove.**\n\nThese are the statements that logically follow from the given information.",

Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n\n2. **Rath Actions**:\n   - A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   - A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\n3. **Tove Actions**:\n   - Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle unless every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n\n4. **Zindle and Rafin**:\n   - Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n5. **Tove Gyred**:\n   - Not all toves gyred if and only if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n6. **Borogove Beamish**:\n   - No borogoves are beamish just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- From the rath actions, we know that every rath snicker-snacked Zindle and galumphed over Zindle.\n\n- For the toves, if every tove galumphed over Rafin, then not every tove snicker-snacked Zindle. Otherwise, every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n- Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin. This means if Zindle galumphed over Bungo, then Rafin did not snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n- Not all toves gyred if and only if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo. This is a biconditional statement.\n\n- No borogoves are beamish just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo. This is another biconditional statement.\n\nFrom the biconditional statements, we can deduce:\n\n- If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all toves gyred and no borogoves are beamish.\n- If not all toves gyred, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\n- If no borogoves are beamish, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\n- If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then no borogoves are beamish.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **No borogoves are beamish unless only toves gyred.**\n   - This is equivalent to saying if not all toves gyred, then no borogoves are beamish. This is consistent with the biconditional statements.\n\n2. **Zindle gyred.**\n   - There is no information directly linking Zindle to gyred.\n\n3. **Not all toves gyred just in case no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - This is consistent with the biconditional statements.\n\n4. **No borogoves are beamish or only toves gyred.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because it suggests a disjunction that doesn't align with the biconditional nature of the statements.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves are beamish and every tove gyred.**\n   - This contradicts the biconditional statements because if no borogoves are beamish, then not all toves gyred.\n\n6. **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n   - There is no information directly linking Zindle or Rafin to gyred.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **Statement 1**: No borogoves are beamish unless only toves gyred.\n- **Statement 3**: Not all toves gyred just in case no borogoves are beamish.\n\nThus, the correct answer is that statements 1 and 3 must be true.",

A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"Every rath is mimsy.\" This directly tells us that all raths are mimsy.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"There is not a rath that every tove galumphed over.\" This implies that there is at least one rath that some tove did not galumph over.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"A borogove galumphed over Rafin unless every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This is a conditional statement. If every tove snicker-snacked Zindle, then it doesn't matter whether a borogove galumphed over Rafin. If not every tove snicker-snacked Zindle, then a borogove must have galumphed over Rafin.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\" This is another conditional statement. If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin must have snicker-snacked Rafin. If some borogoves did snicker-snack Bungo, this condition doesn't apply.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Bungo is a rath.\" This tells us that Bungo is not a rath, but it doesn't affect the mimsiness of raths.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle and Rafin are mimsy.**\n   - We know every rath is mimsy, but we have no information about Zindle or Rafin being raths. Therefore, we cannot conclude they are mimsy.\n\n2. **Only raths are mimsy.**\n   - We only know that every rath is mimsy. There is no information about toves or borogoves being mimsy or not. Thus, we cannot conclude that only raths are mimsy.\n\n3. **No raths are mimsy.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every rath is mimsy.\n\n4. **A rath is mimsy.**\n   - This is directly given in the problem: \"Every rath is mimsy.\"\n\n5. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle being a rath, so we cannot conclude Zindle is mimsy.\n\n6. **Not all raths are mimsy.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every rath is mimsy.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n4. **A rath is mimsy.**",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's analyze the given statements and conditions step by step.\n\n### Given Information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there is at least one of each.\n2. **Interactions**:\n   - A tove chortled at a borogove.\n   - Every tove snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.\n3. **Conditional Statement**:\n   - If Bungo galumphed over Zindle, then every rath galumphed over Rafin only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 1**: \"A tove snicker-snacked a rath.\"\n  - From the condition \"Every tove snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it,\" it implies that if a rath snicker-snacked a tove, then the tove must have snicker-snacked that rath. However, this does not guarantee that any tove snicker-snacked a rath unless there is a rath that snicker-snacked a tove. This statement is not necessarily true without additional information.\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"No toves snicker-snacked a rath.\"\n  - This contradicts the condition that every tove snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it. If no toves snicker-snacked a rath, then no rath could have snicker-snacked a tove, which would make the condition vacuously true but not necessarily true in all cases. This statement cannot be true.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\"\n  - The condition only states that a tove snicker-snacked a rath if that rath snicker-snacked the tove. There is no information to suggest that every tove snicker-snacked every rath. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked.\"\n  - The condition does not imply that there is a specific tove that every rath snicker-snacked. It only states a reciprocal relationship between a tove and a rath if the rath snicker-snacked the tove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"No toves snicker-snacked every rath.\"\n  - This is the negation of Statement 3. Since Statement 3 is not necessarily true, Statement 5 could be true. However, it is not guaranteed by the given conditions alone.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\"\n  - Similar to Statement 3, there is no information to suggest that a tove snicker-snacked every rath. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"No toves snicker-snacked every rath.\"\n\nThis is because the conditions do not support the idea that any tove snicker-snacked every rath, and thus, it must be true that no tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n\n**Final Answer: 5. No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**",

Therefore, it is possible for toves to burble.\n   - We do not have any information that directly states that toves will burble, only that they might burble since the condition preventing them from burbling is not met.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1: A tove will burble.**\n     - This statement suggests that at least one tove will burble. However, we only know that toves might burble; there is no guarantee that any specific tove will burble. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 2: Every tove will burble.**\n     - This statement suggests that all toves will burble. We have no information to support that all toves will burble, only that they might. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 3: Not all toves will burble.**\n     - This statement suggests that at least one tove will not burble. Since we have no information that guarantees any tove will burble, it is possible that not all toves will burble. However, we cannot definitively conclude this from the given information, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 4: Only toves will burble.**\n     - This statement suggests that if anything burbles, it must be a tove. We have no information about borogoves or raths burbling or not burbling, so we cannot conclude that only toves will burble. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 5: Rafin will burble.**\n     - We have no information about Rafin burbling. The fact that Rafin is uffish does not imply anything about burbling. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 6: No toves will burble.**\n     - This statement suggests that toves cannot burble. However, since Bungo is beamish, the condition preventing toves from burbling is not met, so it is possible for toves to burble.

This implies a sequence: Borogove \u2192 Tove \u2192 Borogove.\n\n3. **Snicker-snacking Condition**: A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin. This can be expressed as:\n   - If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n4. **Whiffle Condition**: If Rafin won't whiffle, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo. This can be expressed as:\n   - If Rafin won't whiffle, then (not all toves galumphed over Bungo) \u2192 (no raths galumphed over Bungo).\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - There is no information given about Rafin snicker-snacking anything, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n2. **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - From the condition: \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin,\" we can infer that if any borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all borogoves did. However, we don't have information confirming that any borogove snicker-snacked Rafin. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This is directly related to the condition: \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" However, we don't have enough information to confirm that any borogove snicker-snacked Rafin. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - If every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, it would contradict the condition that a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves did. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - If no borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, it would satisfy the condition \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" because the antecedent (a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin) is false, making the implication true regardless of the consequent. This statement is consistent with the given conditions.\n\n6. **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - There is no information given about Rafin snicker-snacking anything, so this cannot be concluded.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n5. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**",

Since every rath is beamish, if they chortled at Rafin, Rafin must be beamish. However, we don't have information about whether a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin or whether raths chortled at Rafin.

However, there is no information linking Bungo's beamishness to the raths chortling at him. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Bungo is beamish.\n\n   - **Statement 3: Bungo is a rath.**\n     - If Bungo were a rath, then Bungo would chortle at himself, which contradicts the statement that it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo. Therefore, Bungo cannot be a rath.\n\n   - **Statement 4: Rafin and Bungo are beamish.**\n     - We have no information about Rafin being beamish, and we cannot conclude Bungo is beamish.

We need to determine if \"mimsy\" has any implications on whiffling.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Chortling Chain:**\n   - A borogove chortled at a rath, and that rath chortled at a tove. This establishes a sequence but does not directly relate to whiffling.\n\n4. **Whiffling and Toves:**\n   - Not all toves will whiffle, which means at least one tove does not whiffle.\n\n5. **Rafin's Identity:**\n   - Rafin is not a tove, so Rafin is either a borogove or a rath.\n\n6. **Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n   - **Statement 1: Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n     - We have no information linking \"mimsy\" to whiffling. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.\n\n   - **Statement 2: Zindle will whiffle.**\n     - Similar to Statement 1, we lack information about Zindle's whiffling ability.\n\n   - **Statement 3: Zindle won't whiffle.**\n     - Again, we have no information to conclude that Zindle won't whiffle.\n\n   - **Statement 4: Not all toves will whiffle and Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n     - We know not all toves will whiffle, but Zindle is explicitly stated to be mimsy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n   - **Statement 5: Not all toves will whiffle but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n     - This statement is logically equivalent to saying \"Not all toves will whiffle and Zindle is mimsy.\" We know both parts are true: not all toves will whiffle, and Zindle is mimsy.\n\n   - **Statement 6: Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n     - We have no information about Rafin's whiffling ability, and we cannot conclude Zindle's whiffling ability.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only statement that must be true based on the given information is Statement 5: \"Not all toves will whiffle but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.\"\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 5 must be true.**",

Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and there is at least one of each.\n2. **Properties**:\n   - A borogove is uffish.\n   - A rath is uffish.\n   - No borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n   - Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   - Only toves gimbled.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Zindle and Rafin gimbled.**\n   - Only toves gimbled. Therefore, Zindle and Rafin can only gimbled if they are toves. This statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information to confirm that Zindle and Rafin are toves.\n\n2. **A borogove is uffish just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - A borogove is always uffish, regardless of whether toves snicker-snacked Zindle. The condition \"just in case\" implies a biconditional relationship, which is not supported by the given information. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A borogove is uffish just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - A borogove is always uffish, and we know not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. However, the \"just in case\" implies a biconditional relationship, which is not supported. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo gimbled.**\n   - Only toves gimbled. Therefore, Zindle and Bungo can only gimbled if they are toves. This statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information to confirm that Zindle and Bungo are toves.\n\n5. **Zindle didn't gimble.**\n   - Only toves gimbled. If Zindle is not a tove, then Zindle didn't gimble. However, we don't have enough information to confirm Zindle's type. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Zindle gimbled.**\n   - Only toves gimbled. If Zindle is a tove, then Zindle gimbled. However, we don't have enough information to confirm Zindle's type. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the statements must be true based on the information provided. However, statement 3 is the closest to being true because it aligns with the given condition that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, but it still does not establish a necessary biconditional relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that none of the statements must be true.",

No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n4. A borogove will burble and only toves are mimsy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 2**: No toves snicker-snacked Rafin. This means that if something snicker-snacked Rafin, it cannot be a tove.\n\n- **Condition 3**: \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" This is a conditional statement. The contrapositive is: \"If all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then some borogoves are mimsy.\" However, from Condition 4, we know that only toves are mimsy, so no borogoves can be mimsy. Therefore, it must be the case that not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n- **Condition 4**: A borogove will burble and only toves are mimsy. This confirms that no borogoves are mimsy.\n\n### Conclusion from Conditions:\n\nFrom Condition 3 and the fact that no borogoves are mimsy (Condition 4), we conclude that not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin. This directly supports statement 4.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n1. **A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. We only know that not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, so some might have, but it's not a certainty.\n\n2. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. We know not all did, but some might have.\n\n3. **Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The statements only discuss who snicker-snacked Rafin, not the reverse.\n\n4. **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This must be true, as derived from the analysis of Conditions 3 and 4.\n\n5. **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. We only know that not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, not the reverse.\n\n6. **Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This is false, as it contradicts the conclusion from Conditions 3 and 4.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n4.

A borogove chortled at Rafin and a rath is beamish.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: Every borogove galumphed over every tove. This implies that no tove can galumph over a borogove, as galumphing is a one-way action from borogoves to toves.\n\n- **Statement 4**: Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if every tove chortled at Bungo. This is a conditional statement. If Zindle is a borogove, then it didn't galumph over Bungo, which implies every tove chortled at Bungo. If Zindle is not a borogove, the statement doesn't provide information about galumphing.\n\n- **Statement 5**: If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if every rath chortled at Bungo. This is a nested conditional. If Bungo is beamish, then either all toves galumphed over Zindle or not every rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n- **Statement 6**: A borogove chortled at Rafin and a rath is beamish. This tells us Rafin is a rath and is beamish.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**  \n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which says every borogove galumphed over every tove. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n2. **Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**  \n   - This is also contradicted by Statement 2, as no tove can galumph over a borogove.\n\n3. **No toves galumphed over every borogove.**  \n   - This is consistent with Statement 2, as no tove can galumph over any borogove, let alone every borogove.\n\n4. **A tove galumphed over a borogove.**  \n   - This is contradicted by Statement 2, as no tove can galumph over a borogove.\n\n5. **There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.**  \n   - This is consistent with Statement 2, as every borogove galumphed over every tove.\n\n6. **A tove galumphed over every borogove.**  \n   - This is contradicted by Statement 2, as no tove can galumph over any borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n\n- **3. No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n- **5. There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.**\n\nThese conclusions are consistent with the information provided, particularly Statement 2.",

Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since Bungo is a rath, and Bungo galumphed over every rath, Bungo galumphed over himself.\n- We need to determine the truth of each statement based on the given information.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - This depends on whether Zindle is mimsy. We don't have information about Zindle being mimsy, so we cannot conclude that Zindle will burble.\n\n2. **Zindle and Bungo will burble.**\n   - For this to be true, Zindle must be mimsy (so Bungo will burble) and Bungo must burble independently. We only know Bungo will burble if Zindle is mimsy, but we don't have enough information to confirm Zindle is mimsy or that Bungo will burble independently.\n\n3. **Bungo didn't galumph over Bungo.**\n   - This is false because Bungo galumphed over every rath, and Bungo is a rath.\n\n4. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle being mimsy or Rafin burbling. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement is true.\n\n5. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - We cannot conclude this because Zindle might be mimsy, which would cause Bungo to burble, but it doesn't directly affect Zindle burbling.\n\n6. **Bungo galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This is true because Bungo galumphed over every rath, and Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n6. **Bungo galumphed over Bungo.**",

Not all raths galumphed over Rafin, and Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n4. A borogove chortled at Rafin.\n5. Every tove will whiffle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"Every tove will whiffle.\" This is explicitly given, so it must be true.\n\n- **Statement 1**: \"Only toves will whiffle.\" This statement implies that no borogoves or raths will whiffle. However, the problem does not provide any information about whether borogoves or raths can whiffle. Therefore, we cannot conclude that only toves will whiffle. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"No toves will whiffle.\" This contradicts the given information that every tove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Zindle will whiffle.\" There is no information given about Zindle's ability to whiffle. The problem only states that every tove will whiffle, but Zindle's classification is not mentioned. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle will whiffle. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Not all toves will whiffle.\" This contradicts the given information that every tove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"A tove will whiffle.\" This is directly supported by the given information that every tove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.\" As with Zindle, there is no information about Rafin's ability to whiffle. The problem only states that every tove will whiffle, but neither Zindle nor Rafin is confirmed to be a tove. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.

Every borogove is uffish.\n6. Every borogove gyred just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Zindle is uffish**: From statement 2, Zindle is uffish. From statement 5, every borogove is uffish. Therefore, Zindle could be a borogove.\n\n- **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo**: This is a given fact and doesn't directly affect the other statements.\n\n- **No toves chortled at Rafin**: This means Rafin cannot be a tove.\n\n- **Every borogove is uffish**: This confirms that Zindle, being uffish, could be a borogove.\n\n- **Every borogove gyred just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo**: This is a biconditional statement. It means:\n  - If every borogove gyred, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\n  - If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then every borogove gyred.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n1. **Zindle and Bungo gyred**: We don't have enough information to conclude this. Zindle could be a borogove and thus gyred, but we don't know about Bungo.\n\n2. **Zindle didn't gyre**: This contradicts the possibility of Zindle being a borogove, which would mean Zindle gyred.\n\n3. **Rafin gyred**: Rafin cannot be a borogove (since no toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove), so Rafin cannot gyred.\n\n4. **Zindle gyred**: If Zindle is a borogove, then Zindle gyred. This is possible but not certain without knowing Zindle's exact classification.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin gyred**: Rafin cannot gyred, so this cannot be true.\n\n6. **Zindle is uffish and no toves chortled at Rafin**: This is a combination of given facts. Zindle is uffish, and no toves chortled at Rafin.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. If a rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then every tove chortled at Bungo.\n3. Every rath gimbled.\n4. Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n5. Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n6. It is not the case that Rafin isn't uffish (which implies Rafin is uffish).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 3** tells us that every rath gimbled. This is a crucial piece of information.\n- **Statement 4** tells us Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n- **Statement 5** tells us Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n- **Statement 2** is conditional: If a rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then every tove chortled at Bungo. However, we don't have information about whether a rath snicker-snacked Bungo, so we can't directly use this statement.\n- **Statement 6** (Rafin is uffish) doesn't directly affect the logical deductions about chortling or gimbled.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n1. **Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case a rath gimbled.**\n   - \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" We know every rath gimbled, but we have no information about Zindle chortling at Bungo. This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **A rath chortled at Zindle only if Bungo gimbled.**\n   - We know Bungo chortled at Zindle, but there's no information about Bungo gimbled or a rath chortling at Zindle. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n3. **Every rath gimbled but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Bungo chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all raths gimbled just in case Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know every rath gimbled, so \"not all raths gimbled\" is false. \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if,\" so this statement is false because the left side is false.\n\n5. **Every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This is consistent with the given information: every rath gimbled, and Bungo chortled at Zindle. This statement is true.\n\n6. **If a rath chortled at Zindle, then Bungo gimbled.**\n   - We have no information about a rath chortling at Zindle or Bungo gimbled. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n5. **Every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Zindle.**",

Bungo could be a borogove or a rath.\n\n- **Rafin**: Rafin chortled at Bungo. Rafin could be any of the three types, but since it chortled, it cannot be a tove (as only toves gimbled, and gimbled does not imply chortling).\n\n- **Borogove**: A borogove chortled at Rafin.

A borogove chortled at Rafin, and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n2. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - False.

If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"Every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" This implies that all raths have galumphed over Rafin. Therefore, statement 1 (\"A rath galumphed over Rafin\") is true, and statement 4 (\"No raths galumphed over Rafin\") is false.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"A rath galumphed over every tove that galumphed over it.\" This implies that if a tove galumphed over a rath, then that rath must have galumphed over the tove. This doesn't directly help us determine if Rafin galumphed over a rath, but it does imply a certain order of galumphing between raths and toves.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"A borogove is mimsy unless Rafin galumphed over Rafin.\" This means that if Rafin did not galumph over Rafin, then all borogoves are mimsy. If Rafin galumphed over Rafin, then some borogoves might not be mimsy.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"If no borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.\" This implies that if all borogoves are mimsy, we cannot conclude anything about Bungo snicker-snacking Rafin.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This is a conditional statement that depends on the mimsiness of borogoves and the actions of Bungo and toves.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From statement 2, we know all raths galumphed over Rafin, so statement 2 (\"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin\") is false.\n\n- Since all raths galumphed over Rafin, statement 3 (\"Rafin galumphed over a rath\") is not necessarily true. There is no information suggesting Rafin galumphed over any rath.\n\n- Statement 6 (\"Rafin galumphed over every rath\") is not necessarily true because we only know that all raths galumphed over Rafin, not the other way around.\n\n- Statement 5 (\"Zindle is mimsy\") is unrelated to the given conditions about galumphing and mimsiness of borogoves.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. **A rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n\nThis is directly supported by statement 2, which states that every rath galumphed over Rafin.",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and determine which statements must be true.\n\n### Given Conditions:\n\n1. Everything is a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every rath chortled at Zindle and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n3. Every borogove is mimsy if and only if not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n4. Zindle isn't mimsy.\n5. Bungo is not a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 2**: Every rath chortled at Zindle. Therefore, Zindle cannot be a rath (since Zindle isn't mimsy, and if Zindle were a rath, it would imply Zindle chortled at itself, which is not possible).\n\n- **Condition 5**: Bungo is not a rath. Therefore, Bungo must be either a tove or a borogove.\n\n- **Condition 4**: Zindle isn't mimsy. Since Zindle isn't a rath (from the analysis above), Zindle must be either a tove or a borogove. If Zindle were a borogove, it would be mimsy unless not all borogoves chortled at Bungo. Since Zindle isn't mimsy, it must be a tove.\n\n- **Condition 3**: Every borogove is mimsy if and only if not all borogoves chortled at Bungo. Since Zindle isn't mimsy and is a tove, we need to determine the status of borogoves:\n  - If all borogoves chortled at Bungo, then no borogove is mimsy.\n  - If not all borogoves chortled at Bungo, then every borogove is mimsy.\n\n- **Condition 2 (continued)**: Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo. This implies Rafin is not a borogove (since borogoves chortle at Bungo if they are mimsy, and if not all chortled, they are all mimsy).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Zindle**: Must be a tove (not mimsy).\n- **Rafin**: Didn't chortle at Bungo, so Rafin is not a borogove. Rafin could be a tove or a rath.\n- **Bungo**: Not a rath, so Bungo is either a tove or a borogove.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Zindle isn't mimsy but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - Zindle isn't mimsy (true). Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo (true), so \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is false. This statement is false.\n\n2. **Zindle isn't mimsy and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - Zindle isn't mimsy (true). Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo (true). This statement is true.\n\n3. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.**\n   - Zindle isn't mimsy (false). This statement is false.\n\n4. **Rafin is mimsy.**\n   - Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo, so Rafin is not a borogove. Rafin could be a rath (and raths can be mimsy), but we don't have enough information to conclude Rafin is mimsy. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are mimsy.**\n   - Zindle isn't mimsy (false). This statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - Zindle isn't mimsy (false). This statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n2. Zindle isn't mimsy and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.",

Rafin is a tove.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\" This directly tells us that no tove has snicker-snacked any borogove. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n- **Rafin is a tove**: Since Rafin is a tove, and no toves snicker-snacked a borogove, Rafin did not snicker-snack any borogove.\n\n- **A borogove chortled at Rafin**: This does not directly affect the snicker-snacking relationship between toves and borogoves.\n\n- **Conditional Statement**: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\" This is a complex conditional, but it doesn't directly affect the relationship between toves and borogoves in terms of snicker-snacking, especially since Rafin is a tove and no toves snicker-snack borogoves.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This cannot be true because no toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\n\n2. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This cannot be true for the same reason as above.\n\n3. **A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This cannot be true because no toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\n\n4. **There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.**\n   - This could be true.

Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - There is no information given about Zindle's mimsiness. The problem does not provide any direct or indirect evidence about Zindle being mimsy. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **Bungo chortled at every rath.**\n   - We know Bungo is a rath and chortled at Bungo. However, the statement \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo\" implies that there is at least one rath that did not chortle at Bungo. This does not directly affect whether Bungo chortled at every rath, but it does not provide evidence that Bungo did chortle at every rath either. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **No raths chortled at Bungo.**\n   - The statement \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo\" implies that at least one rath did not chortle at Bungo, but it does not imply that no raths chortled at Bungo. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.**\n   - We know Bungo is not mimsy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A rath chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Since Bungo is a rath and chortled at Bungo, it is possible that Bungo chortled at itself. This satisfies the condition that at least one rath chortled at Bungo. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Every rath chortled at Bungo.**\n   - The statement \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo\" directly contradicts this statement.

Not all toves will whiffle.\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\" This directly implies that statement 1 (\"A borogove chortled at Zindle\") is true. Since every borogove chortled at Zindle, at least one borogove did, making statement 1 true.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin won't whiffle.\" We know from statement 6 that not all toves will whiffle, which implies that not all toves chortled at Bungo (since chortling and whiffling are likely opposite actions). Therefore, the condition \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true. This means that a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin won't whiffle. However, we don't have information about Rafin whiffling or not, so we can't conclude anything further from this statement.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"A borogove chortled at Rafin.\" This is given directly and doesn't affect the conclusions about Zindle.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **A borogove chortled at Zindle.**  \n   - True, as directly stated in statement 3.\n\n2. **Zindle chortled at a borogove.**  \n   - We have no information about Zindle's actions towards borogoves, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n3. **Zindle chortled at every borogove.**  \n   - Again, we have no information about Zindle's actions towards borogoves, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n4. **No borogoves chortled at Zindle.**  \n   - False, as directly contradicted by statement 3.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**  \n   - We have no information about Zindle whiffling, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n6. **Not all borogoves chortled at Zindle.**  \n   - False, as directly contradicted by statement 3, which states every borogove chortled at Zindle.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1.

Bungo isn't mimsy and Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: No raths are uffish.  \n  Since Bungo is a rath (from statement 6), Bungo cannot be uffish.  \n  Therefore, statement 1 (\"Bungo isn't uffish\") must be true.\n\n- **Statement 6**: Bungo isn't mimsy and Bungo is a rath.  \n  This directly tells us Bungo is not mimsy.\n\n- **Statement 4**: If Zindle is mimsy, then every rath chortled at Rafin.  \n  We don't have enough information to determine if Zindle is mimsy or not, so we cannot conclude statements 3 or 4.\n\n- **Statement 5**: If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then every rath is beamish only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.  \n  This is a conditional statement that depends on whether not all toves chortled at Bungo. We don't have enough information to determine this, so we cannot conclude anything about Zindle chortling at Zindle or the beamishness of raths.\n\n- **Statements 5 and 6**: Since Bungo isn't mimsy, statement 6 (\"Zindle and Bungo are mimsy\") is false.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Since Bungo isn't mimsy, statement 5 (\"Zindle and Rafin are mimsy\") cannot be concluded as true because we don't have information about Rafin's mimsiness.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1.

If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 3** states that no toves galumphed over Bungo. This directly affects **Condition 4**, which states that Bungo will burble only if a tove galumphed over Bungo. Since no toves galumphed over Bungo, Bungo cannot burble. Therefore, statement 4 (\"Bungo won't burble\") must be true.\n\n- **Condition 5** involves a conditional statement: If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo. We know from Condition 3 that no toves galumphed over Bungo, but this doesn't directly affect Zindle or Bungo burbling unless we know more about raths and Zindle.\n\n- Since Bungo won't burble (from Condition 4), statement 1 (\"Bungo will burble\") is false.\n\n- We have no information about Zindle burbling directly from the conditions. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude statements 2 (\"Zindle won't burble\"), 3 (\"Zindle will burble\"), or 5 (\"Zindle and Bungo will burble\").\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n4. Bungo won't burble.",

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: a tove, a borogove, and a rath.\n3. Rafin is a tove.\n4. Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n5. A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n6. A borogove galumphed over Rafin or Rafin galumphed over Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Rafin is a tove** and chortled at Zindle. This means Zindle is not a tove because a tove cannot chortle at another tove (since Rafin is a tove and chortled at Zindle, Zindle cannot be a tove).\n\n- **A rath galumphed over Zindle.** This implies Zindle is not a rath because a rath cannot galumph over another rath.\n\n- From the above two points, Zindle must be a borogove.\n\n- **A borogove galumphed over Rafin or Rafin galumphed over Rafin.** Since Rafin is a tove, Rafin cannot galumph over himself (assuming galumphing is an action between different entities). Therefore, a borogove must have galumphed over Rafin.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle chortled at a tove.**\n   - We know Zindle is a borogove. There is no information about Zindle chortling at anyone, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Zindle chortled at every tove.**\n   - Again, there is no information about Zindle chortling at anyone, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at Zindle.**\n   - Rafin, a tove, chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **A tove chortled at Zindle.**\n   - Rafin, a tove, chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Every tove chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We only know Rafin chortled at Zindle. There is no information about other toves, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Not all toves chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We only know Rafin chortled at Zindle.

There is at least one tove, one borogove, and one rath.\n\n2. **Every borogove gyred.**\n   - This means all borogoves have the property of gyred.\n\n3. **Rafin isn't a tove and a borogove will whiffle.**\n   - Rafin cannot be a tove. Since every borogove will whiffle, if Rafin were a borogove, Rafin would whiffle.\n\n4. **Rafin is a tove unless a rath is beamish.**\n   - This means Rafin is a tove if a rath is not beamish. If a rath is beamish, then Rafin is not a tove.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: A rath is beamish.**\n  - If a rath is beamish, Rafin is not a tove (from statement 4).\n  - Since Rafin isn't a tove (from statement 3), Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n  - If Rafin is a borogove, Rafin will whiffle (from statement 3).\n  - If Rafin is a rath, Rafin won't whiffle (since only borogoves whiffle).\n\n- **Scenario 2: A rath is not beamish.**\n  - If a rath is not beamish, Rafin is a tove (from statement 4).\n  - Since Rafin is a tove, Rafin won't whiffle (since only borogoves whiffle).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Not all borogoves gyred.**\n   - This is false because every borogove gyred (from statement 2).\n\n2. **No borogoves gyred.**\n   - This is false because every borogove gyred (from statement 2).\n\n3. **A borogove gyred.**\n   - This is true because every borogove gyred (from statement 2).\n\n4. **Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - This is only true if Rafin is a borogove. We don't have enough information to definitively say Rafin is a borogove in all scenarios.\n\n5. **Only borogoves gyred.**\n   - This is true because the statement \"every borogove gyred\" implies only borogoves have the property of gyred.\n\n6. **Rafin won't whiffle.**\n   - This is true if Rafin is a tove or a rath. In both scenarios, Rafin can be a tove or a rath, so Rafin won't whiffle.\n\nThus, the statements that must be true are:\n\n3. A borogove gyred.\n5. Only borogoves gyred.\n6. Rafin won't whiffle.",

If a rath \\( R_1 \\) snicker-snacked another rath \\( R_2 \\), then \\( R_2 \\) must also snicker-snack \\( R_1 \\).\n   - The statement \"A rath galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it\" suggests a cycle involving a rath and a borogove, but it doesn't directly affect the snicker-snacking relationship among raths.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1:** \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.\" This would imply a complete mutual snicker-snacking among all raths. However, the given information only states that if one rath snicker-snacks another, the reverse must also be true. It doesn't imply that all raths snicker-snack each other. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n   \n   - **Statement 2:** \"A rath snicker-snacked a rath.\" This is possible given the reflexive nature of the snicker-snacking relationship, but it is not guaranteed by the information provided. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n   \n   - **Statement 3:** \"A rath snicker-snacked every rath.\" This would imply that there is at least one rath that snicker-snacked all other raths. The given information does not support this conclusion, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n   \n   - **Statement 4:** \"A rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\" This is directly supported by the given information: \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n   \n   - **Statement 5:** \"No raths snicker-snacked every rath.\" This contradicts Statement 4, which we have determined must be true. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n   \n   - **Statement 6:** \"Every rath snicker-snacked a rath.\" This is possible if there is at least one rath that snicker-snacked another rath, but it is not guaranteed by the information provided.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every rath galumphed over every rath.\n3. Not all raths galumphed over Rafin.\n4. Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n5. If Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin\" implies that at least one rath did not galumph over Rafin. This means Rafin is not a rath because if Rafin were a rath, all raths would galumph over Rafin (including Rafin itself).\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"If Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\n  - If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then the condition \"every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" must hold.\n  - \"Every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" is a conditional statement. It means if every rath is mimsy, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo. The contrapositive is: if all toves galumphed over Bungo, then not every rath is mimsy.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- Since Rafin is not a rath (from Statement 3), we can focus on the implications of Rafin's actions and characteristics.\n\n- **Rafin chortled at Zindle**: This doesn't directly affect the mimsiness of Zindle or Rafin.\n\n- **Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin**: This is a tautology (Rafin can't snicker-snack itself), so the condition in Statement 5 is always true. Therefore, \"every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" must hold.\n\n- If \"every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" holds, then:\n  - If every rath is mimsy, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n  - If all toves galumphed over Bungo, then not every rath is mimsy.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle and Rafin are mimsy**: We have no information directly linking Zindle or Rafin to being mimsy.\n\n2. **Zindle isn't mimsy**: We have no information directly linking Zindle to not being mimsy.\n\n3. **Zindle is mimsy**: We have no information directly linking Zindle to being mimsy.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy**: We have no information directly linking Zindle or Bungo to being mimsy.\n\n5. **Rafin is a rath**: We deduced that Rafin is not a rath because not all raths galumphed over Rafin.\n\n6. **Rafin isn't a rath**: This must be true based on our deduction from Statement 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n6. **Rafin isn't a rath.**",

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - This is a logical contradiction. \"Every borogove is mimsy\" and \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" cannot both be true simultaneously.

If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n\n- **Statement 3** tells us that every rath galumphed over Rafin. Since no raths galumphed over a rath (Statement 2), Rafin cannot be a rath. Therefore, Rafin must be either a tove or a borogove.\n\n- **Statement 4** tells us that Rafin isn't a tove. Therefore, Rafin must be a borogove.\n\n- **Statement 5** involves a conditional statement: \"If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\n  - Let's break this down:\n    - If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo.\n    - This means if there exists at least one tove that did not chortle at Bungo, then for a borogove to snicker-snack Bungo, Bungo must have galumphed over itself.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **Bungo isn't a tove.**\n   - We have no direct information about Bungo being a tove or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Rafin is a tove.**\n   - We have deduced that Rafin is a borogove, not a tove.

Only toves gyred or every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n5. No toves snicker-snacked Zindle only if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n**Statement 3:** Rafin galumphed over every borogove.\n\n- From Statement 2, no toves galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, Rafin cannot be a tove.\n\n**Conclusion from Statement 3 and 2:** Rafin isn't a tove.\n\n**Statement 4:** Only toves gyred or every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n\n- Since Rafin isn't a tove, the \"only toves gyred\" part implies that if anything gyred, it must be a tove.\n- Alternatively, if no toves gyred, then every tove must have galumphed over Rafin.\n\n**Statement 5:** No toves snicker-snacked Zindle only if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n- This is a conditional statement. If no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then Rafin must have snicker-snacked Rafin.\n- The contrapositive is: If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then some toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle gyred.**\n   - If Zindle gyred, then Zindle must be a tove (from Statement 4).\n   - There is no information that directly confirms Zindle is a tove, so this is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - We have already deduced this from Statements 2 and 3. This must be true.\n\n3. **Rafin is a tove.**\n   - This contradicts our deduction from Statements 2 and 3. This cannot be true.\n\n4. **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n   - If Zindle didn't gyre, then either every tove galumphed over Rafin (from Statement 4) or Zindle is not a tove.\n   - There is no direct evidence to confirm Zindle didn't gyre, so this is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Rafin gyred.**\n   - There is no information that directly confirms Rafin gyred. Rafin could be a borogove or a rath, and there is no restriction on these categories gyred.\n\n6. **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n   - If both gyred, both must be toves (from Statement 4).\n   - We know Rafin isn't a tove, so this cannot be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n2.

Everything is a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all borogoves are beamish.\n3. Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.\n4. If not all borogoves are mimsy, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo is beamish.\n5. If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.\n6. Zindle isn't beamish.\n7. Rafin isn't uffish.\n8. Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n9. Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Zindle's Characteristics:**\n  - Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle (Statement 3).\n  - Zindle isn't beamish (Statement 6).\n\n- **Rafin's Characteristics:**\n  - Rafin isn't uffish (Statement 7).\n  - Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo (Statement 9).\n\n- **Rath's Characteristics:**\n  - Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle (Statement 8).\n\n### Deductions:\n\n1. **Zindle's Type:**\n   - Since every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, Zindle cannot be a rath (because a rath cannot snicker-snack itself). Therefore, Zindle is either a tove or a borogove.\n\n2. **Rafin's Snicker-snacking:**\n   - If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish (Statement 5).\n   - We don't have direct information about Rafin snicker-snacking Rafin, so we consider both possibilities:\n     - If Rafin did snicker-snack Rafin, Statement 5 doesn't apply.\n     - If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then for a borogove to snicker-snack Bungo, no borogoves can be beamish.\n\n3. **Borogoves and Beamish:**\n   - Not all borogoves are beamish (Statement 2).\n   - If not all borogoves are mimsy, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo is beamish (Statement 4).\n\n4. **Zindle's Mimsiness:**\n   - We need to determine if Zindle is mimsy or not.\n   - If Zindle is a borogove, then Zindle could potentially be mimsy or not, depending on the distribution of mimsy among borogoves.\n   - If Zindle is a tove, the mimsiness condition doesn't directly apply.\n\n5. **Bungo's Beamishness:**\n   - If Bungo is beamish, it affects the conditions under which borogoves snicker-snack Rafin or Bungo.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Zindle is not a rath** (from the deduction that every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, so Zindle cannot be a rath).\n- **Zindle's mimsiness** is not directly determined by the given information. We cannot definitively conclude whether Zindle is mimsy or not without additional information about the distribution of mimsy among borogoves or toves.\n\nThus, the only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n6. **Zindle isn't a rath.**\n\nThis is the only conclusion that follows directly and necessarily from the given conditions.",

The condition involving Zindle and the raths doesn't directly imply this.\n\n4. **Every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is not necessarily true.

This is explicitly given.\n\n- **Statement 7**: A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle. This is a biconditional statement.\n\n  - If a borogove chortled at Zindle, then no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n  - Conversely, if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then a borogove chortled at Zindle.\n\n- **Statement 2**: Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove. This implies that toves are involved in snicker-snacking, but it doesn't directly involve Zindle.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From Statement 4, we know every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, it is not possible that no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, because if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then by Statement 7, no borogove would have chortled at Zindle. However, this does not directly contradict any given information about snicker-snacking.\n\n- Since every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle, it must be the case that at least one tove snicker-snacked Zindle. Otherwise, by Statement 7, a borogove would have chortled at Zindle, which is not mentioned as a given fact.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the above deductions, the statement that must be true is:\n\n5. **Zindle snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n\nThis conclusion follows because if every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle, then Zindle must have snicker-snacked at least one borogove to satisfy the logical structure of the problem, especially considering the implications of the biconditional statement (Statement 7).",

Therefore, Bungo must be either a tove or a rath.\n\n- **Statement 1**: Bungo isn't a borogove.  \n  This must be true based on the analysis above.\n\n- **Statement 3**: Bungo is a borogove.  \n  This contradicts our analysis, so it cannot be true.\n\n- **Statement 4**: If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove.  \n  This is a contradiction (if P, then not P), so it cannot be true.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.  \n  This is logically equivalent to saying \"If Bungo is a borogove, then Bungo isn't a borogove,\" which is a contradiction.

For the inner statement to be false:\n  - Not all toves galumphed over Bungo, and not every rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n  However, if Zindle burbles, the original conditional is vacuously true, and we have no contradiction.

This implies there exists a tove \\( T \\) such that \\( T \\) galumphed over \\( R \\), and \\( R \\) galumphed over \\( T \\). This creates a cycle between a rath and a tove.\n\n- **Snicker-snacking Condition**:\n  - A rath \\( R_1 \\) snicker-snacked a rath \\( R_2 \\) that snicker-snacked a rath \\( R_3 \\). This implies a chain of snicker-snacking among raths.\n\n- **Bungo's Condition**:\n  - If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo. This condition is more about the relationship between Bungo and Zindle and does not directly affect the relationships between toves and raths.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n1. **No toves galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This cannot be true because the condition states that every rath galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it, implying at least one tove galumphed over a rath.\n\n2. **A tove galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This must be true because of the condition that every rath galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\n\n3. **No toves galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This could be true, but it is not necessarily true. The condition only guarantees that at least one tove galumphed over each rath, not necessarily the same tove over every rath.\n\n4. **A tove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true.

This directly implies that any statement suggesting a tove snicker-snacked another tove is false.\n\n- **Statement 3**: A rath snicker-snacked a tove. This is a specific instance that confirms at least one rath has snicker-snacked a tove.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Rafin isn't a tove. This means Rafin is either a borogove or a rath.\n\n- **Statement 6**: Every rath will whiffle or it is not the case that Rafin is a tove. Since Rafin isn't a tove (from Statement 5), this statement is trivially true regardless of whether raths whiffle.\n\n- **Statement 7**: No borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath galumphed over Rafin. This is a conditional statement. If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then every rath must have galumphed over Rafin. If at least one borogove did snicker-snack Bungo, the condition is vacuously true.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Every tove snicker-snacked a tove.**  \n   - This is false because no toves snicker-snacked a tove (Statement 2).\n\n2. **There is a tove that every tove snicker-snacked.**  \n   - This cannot be true because no toves snicker-snacked a tove (Statement 2).\n\n3. **A tove snicker-snacked a tove.**  \n   - This is false because no toves snicker-snacked a tove (Statement 2).\n\n4. **A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.**  \n   - This could be true or false.

If Rafin is a tove, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 2** states that if a tove chortled at another tove, then the second tove chortled back at the first. This is a mutual chortling condition among toves.\n\n- **Condition 3** tells us that Rafin chortled at a tove. We don't know if Rafin is a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n\n- **Condition 4** is a conditional statement about Rafin being a tove. It involves Bungo and the chortling behavior of raths and borogoves, but it doesn't directly affect the chortling behavior among toves unless Rafin is a tove.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A tove chortled at every tove that chortled at it.**\n   - This is directly given by Condition 2. It must be true.\n\n2. **Every tove chortled at every tove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. Condition 2 only ensures mutual chortling, not that every tove chortled at every other tove.\n\n3. **Every tove chortled at a tove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. There is no information that every tove chortled at another tove.\n\n4. **A tove chortled at a tove.**\n   - This must be true because Rafin chortled at a tove (Condition 3), and if Rafin is a tove, then a tove chortled at a tove. If Rafin is not a tove, there is still at least one tove chortling at another tove.\n\n5. **A tove chortled at every tove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. There is no information that any tove chortled at every other tove.\n\n6. **No toves chortled at every tove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all toves chortled at Zindle.\n3. Every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\n4. If Rafin is a tove, then every rath galumphed over Rafin only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 3** is crucial: \"Every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\" This implies a kind of mutual or circular galumphing among toves. If tove A galumphs over tove B, then there must be some tove C such that C galumphs over A.\n\n- **Condition 4** involves Rafin and Bungo. It states a conditional relationship involving raths and toves, but it doesn't directly affect the mutual galumphing condition among toves unless Rafin is a tove.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n1. **There is a tove that every tove galumphed over.**\n   - This would imply a single tove that is at the bottom of the galumphing hierarchy. However, condition 3 suggests a circular or mutual relationship, not a linear hierarchy. Thus, this statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n2. **Every tove galumphed over every tove.**\n   - This would imply a complete graph of galumphing among toves. Condition 3 does not imply this; it only requires mutual galumphing, not universal galumphing.\n\n3. **No toves galumphed over every tove.**\n   - This is consistent with condition 3, which suggests a circular relationship rather than a universal one. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **A tove galumphed over a tove.**\n   - Condition 3 implies that if any tove galumphs over another, there is a mutual relationship. Therefore, at least one instance of a tove galumphing over another must exist. This statement must be true.\n\n5. **A tove galumphed over every tove.**\n   - This would imply a single tove at the top of the hierarchy, which contradicts the mutual galumphing condition. Thus, this statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n6. **No toves galumphed over a tove.**\n   - This contradicts condition 3, which implies that galumphing does occur among toves. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n- **3. No toves galumphed over every tove.**\n- **4.

However, we don't have information confirming Zindle is a rath. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle is uffish.\n\n   - **Statement 6: A rath is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n     - We know from the problem statement that a rath is uffish and that a rath galumphed over Zindle.

No toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 2, we know that no toves chortled at Bungo. This means that if someone chortled at Bungo, they cannot be a tove.\n- Point 3 is redundant given point 2, as \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is implied by \"no toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n- Point 4 can be rephrased as: \"No toves chortled at Bungo, and Rafin chortled at Bungo.\" This implies that Rafin is not a tove because no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - This simplifies to: \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo, and Rafin is a tove.\"\n   - We know no toves chortled at Bungo, so \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true. However, Rafin chortled at Bungo, so Rafin cannot be a tove. This statement is false.\n\n2. **Bungo chortled at Bungo and no toves chortled at Rafin.**\n   - We have no information about Bungo chortling at Bungo or toves chortling at Rafin. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true (since no toves chortled at Bungo). Rafin chortled at Bungo, so Rafin isn't a tove. This statement is true.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at Rafin and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We have no information about toves chortling at Rafin or Bungo chortling at Bungo. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and no toves chortled at Rafin.**\n   - \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true.

No toves will burble just in case a borogove is mimsy.\n\n### Logical Analysis:\n\n- From statement 4, \"No toves will burble just in case a borogove is mimsy,\" we can infer:\n  - If a borogove is mimsy, then no toves will burble.\n  - If no toves will burble, then a borogove is mimsy.\n\n- From statement 3, \"A borogove is uffish if and only if no toves will burble,\" we can infer:\n  - If a borogove is uffish, then no toves will burble.\n  - If no toves will burble, then a borogove is uffish.\n\nCombining these two:\n- A borogove is uffish if and only if a borogove is mimsy.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A borogove is uffish just in case a borogove is mimsy.**\n   - This is true based on our combined inference.\n\n2. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Zindle will burble.

A single mimsy borogove is enough for no toves to burble, making that borogove uffish.\n\n4. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, we don't have enough information to determine if Zindle won't burble.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if both Zindle and Rafin will burble.\n\n6. **A borogove is uffish just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - This is false.

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Only borogoves will burble.**\n   - Since no borogoves will burble, this statement is false.\n\n3. **A borogove will burble.**\n   - Again, since no borogoves will burble, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n   - There is no information given about Zindle or Rafin burbling. The only action mentioned for Zindle is that a rath galumphed over it. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle will burble. Similarly, there is no information about Rafin burbling. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves will burble.**\n   - This statement is consistent with the given information that no borogoves will burble. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - As mentioned earlier, there is no information about Zindle burbling. The only action mentioned is that a rath galumphed over Zindle. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle will burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n5. **Not all borogoves will burble.**",

We only know Rafin chortled at Bungo and possibly at itself. This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - This statement is consistent with the given conditions: no toves chortled at Rafin, and Rafin isn't a tove. This statement must be true.\n\n5. **No toves chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - This implies Rafin is a tove, which contradicts the given condition that Rafin isn't a tove.

Since Bungo is mimsy, Bungo is a tove.\n- **Statement 4**: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then not all toves chortled at Bungo only if Rafin is beamish.\"\n  - Since only toves are mimsy, no borogoves are mimsy. Therefore, \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" is true.\n  - This implies: \"not all toves chortled at Bungo only if Rafin is beamish.\"\n  - This can be rewritten as: If all toves chortled at Bungo, then Rafin is beamish.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Rafin is beamish only if no borogoves are beamish.\"\n  - Since not all borogoves are mimsy, this implies: \"Rafin is beamish only if no borogoves are beamish.\"\n  - This can be rewritten as: If any borogove is beamish, then Rafin is not beamish.\n\n#### Combining Statements 4 and 5:\n\n- From statement 4: If all toves chortled at Bungo, then Rafin is beamish.\n- From statement 5: If any borogove is beamish, then Rafin is not beamish.\n\nThus, if all toves chortled at Bungo, then no borogove can be beamish (otherwise, Rafin would not be beamish, contradicting the conclusion from statement 4).\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\n- Since Bungo is a tove and chortled at Rafin, and we know Bungo is mimsy, we need to determine the implications for other toves.\n- If all toves chortled at Bungo, then Rafin is beamish, and no borogove is beamish.\n- If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then the condition about Rafin being beamish does not apply.\n\nGiven that Bungo chortled at Rafin, and considering the logical structure, it is consistent to conclude that at least one tove (Bungo) chortled at Rafin.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Rafin chortled at every tove.** - No information supports this.\n2. **No toves chortled at Rafin.** - Contradicted by Bungo chortling at Rafin.\n3. **Not all toves chortled at Rafin.** - Possible, but not necessarily true.\n4. **Rafin chortled at a tove.** - No information supports this.\n5. **Every tove chortled at Rafin.** - No information supports this.\n6. **A tove chortled at Rafin.** - True, as Bungo (a tove) chortled at Rafin.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n6.

Every rath chortled at Rafin only if Zindle isn't a borogove.\n     4. A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin.\n     5. If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Zindle isn't a borogove.\n\nThus, the final answer is that statements 1, 4, and 5 must be true.",

Zindle could be a borogove or a rath. Since a rath galumphed over Zindle, Zindle is not a rath (as a rath cannot galumph over itself). Therefore, Zindle could be a borogove or a tove.

Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Bungo just in case every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 5** tells us that for any tove \\( T \\) and any borogove \\( B \\), if \\( B \\) galumphs over \\( T \\), then \\( T \\) galumphs over \\( B \\).\n\n- **Statement 6** is a conditional statement: \"Zindle didn't snicker-snack Bungo just in case every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\" This can be interpreted as:\n  - If every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo, then Zindle didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\n  - Conversely, if Zindle did snicker-snack Bungo, then not every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n  Since Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle (from statement 3), it follows from the contrapositive of the conditional that not every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n- **Statement 4** implies that there is at least one borogove that did not snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - This is possible but not necessarily true.

Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Entities and Actions:**\n   - Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n   - There is at least one of each: tove, borogove, and rath.\n   - No toves chortled at a tove.\n   - Rafin is a tove unless a rath galumphed over Bungo.\n   - If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n   - If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin is a tove only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n   - Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n   - Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**\n   - **Bungo chortled at Bungo:** Since no toves chortled at a tove, Bungo cannot be a tove. Therefore, statement 2 (\"Bungo isn't a tove\") must be true.\n   - **Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle:** This condition doesn't directly affect the classification of Zindle, but it confirms that there are raths.\n   - **Rafin is a tove unless a rath galumphed over Bungo:** This implies that if a rath galumphed over Bungo, Rafin is not a tove. We don't have information about a rath galumphing over Bungo, so we can't conclude Rafin's status yet.\n   - **If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin:** This condition is about the actions of borogoves and doesn't directly affect the classification of Rafin, Bungo, or Zindle.\n   - **If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin is a tove only if every borogove chortled at Bungo:** Since every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, this condition applies. We need to check if every borogove chortled at Bungo to determine Rafin's status.\n\n3. **Determining Rafin's Status:**\n   - We know every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, so we apply the condition: Rafin is a tove only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n   - We don't have information about whether every borogove chortled at Bungo. Therefore, we cannot definitively say Rafin is a tove based on this condition alone.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - **Statement 2 (\"Bungo isn't a tove\")** is the only statement that must be true based on the given information.\n   - We cannot definitively determine the truth of statements 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 without additional information.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n2.

This doesn't directly tell us Bungo's type, but it does confirm Bungo's action.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle only if Bungo is a borogove.\" This is a conditional statement. The contrapositive is: \"If Bungo is not a borogove, then Zindle chortled at Zindle.\" Since we don't have information about Zindle chortling at Zindle, we need to consider the possibility of Bungo being a borogove.\n\n- **Statement 5**: A borogove chortled at Rafin. This means Rafin cannot be a borogove because a borogove cannot chortle at another borogove (as they are exclusive types).\n\n- **Statement 6**: Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle. Since Zindle didn't snicker-snack at Zindle, Zindle cannot be a rath.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From Statement 2 and 6, Zindle is not a rath.\n- From Statement 5, Rafin is not a borogove.\n- From Statement 4, if Bungo is not a borogove, then Zindle chortled at Zindle. However, we don't have information about Zindle chortling at Zindle, so we cannot definitively conclude Bungo's type from this alone.\n- Since there is at least one of each type, and Zindle is not a rath, Zindle must be either a tove or a borogove.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle isn't a rath.**  \n   - This must be true based on our deductions.\n\n2. **Rafin is a borogove.**  \n   - This is false because a borogove chortled at Rafin, so Rafin cannot be a borogove.\n\n3. **Zindle is a borogove.**  \n   - We cannot definitively conclude this because Zindle could be a tove.\n\n4. **Rafin isn't a borogove.**  \n   - This must be true based on our deductions.\n\n5. **Zindle is a rath.**  \n   - This is false because Zindle is not a rath.\n\n6. **Zindle isn't a borogove.**  \n   - We cannot definitively conclude this because Zindle could be a borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n1.

From Statement 4: If any tove is uffish, then all toves must burble.\n2. From Statement 3: If all toves burble, then it is possible for some toves to be uffish. However, if not all toves burble, then no toves can be uffish.\n3. Combining Statements 3 and 4:\n   - If any tove is uffish, then all toves must burble (from Statement 4).\n   - If all toves burble, then it is possible for some toves to be uffish (from Statement 3).\n   - Therefore, if any tove is uffish, all toves must burble, and if all toves burble, some toves can be uffish.\n\n4. From Statement 2: If all toves burble, then every rath will whiffle.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **Every tove is uffish.**\n   - This cannot be concluded because if any tove is uffish, all must burble, but not all toves need to be uffish.\n\n2. **Every tove will whiffle.**\n   - This is not possible because only raths are mentioned to whiffle.\n\n3. **Only toves are uffish.**\n   - This cannot be concluded because the statements do not provide information about borogoves or raths being uffish.\n\n4. **No toves are uffish.**\n   - This must be true if not all toves burble, as per Statement 3.\n\n5. **A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\n6. **A tove is uffish.**\n   - This cannot be concluded definitively because if any tove is uffish, all must burble, but we cannot determine if any tove is uffish without additional information.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n4. **No toves are uffish.**\n\nThis is because if not all toves burble, then no toves can be uffish, and we have no information that all toves burble.",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to analyze the given statements and conditions carefully. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n\n2. **Galumphing**:\n   - Rafin didn't galumph over Rafin.\n   - Bungo galumphed over every borogove.\n   - No toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n3. **Beamish**:\n   - Only borogoves are beamish.\n\n4. **Snicker-snacking**:\n   - Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle.\n   - Not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - Since only borogoves are beamish, Zindle can only be beamish if Zindle is a borogove. We have no information confirming Zindle's type, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Only borogoves are beamish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - The first part is given as a condition (\"Only borogoves are beamish\"). The second part (\"no toves galumphed over Bungo\") is also given as a condition. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - If Bungo is beamish, Bungo must be a borogove. The statement \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" is true because no toves galumphed over Bungo. The condition \"only if no borogoves are beamish\" contradicts the given condition that only borogoves are beamish. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **If Bungo galumphed over Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - Bungo galumphing over Bungo is not possible because it would imply Bungo is both the galumphing entity and the entity being galumphed over, which is not allowed. Therefore, the premise is false, making the entire statement vacuously true. However, this doesn't provide meaningful information about the situation.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - As established, only borogoves are beamish. Without knowing if Zindle and Rafin are borogoves, we cannot conclude they are beamish. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Not all borogoves are beamish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - The first part contradicts the given condition that only borogoves are beamish, meaning all borogoves are beamish. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n2. Only borogoves are beamish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.",

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: tove, borogove, and rath.\n3. Every tove gyred.\n4. No toves chortled at Rafin.\n5. Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\n6. A borogove is mimsy unless every tove will burble.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **No toves chortled at Rafin and every tove gyred.**\n   - From the given information, we know that no toves chortled at Rafin and every tove gyred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n2. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - We know that every borogove chortled at Zindle. For a borogove to be mimsy, every tove must burble. However, we don't have information that directly states Zindle will burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Rafin will burble.**\n   - There is no information given that directly relates Rafin to burbling. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, we don't have enough information to conclude that Zindle won't burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n   - As with statements 2 and 3, there is no information to support that both Zindle and Rafin will burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all toves gyred.**\n   - We know that every tove gyred, so the condition \"not all toves gyred\" is false. Therefore, the statement \"Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all toves gyred\" is vacuously true because the condition is false, making the implication true regardless of whether Rafin chortled at Rafin.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n1. No toves chortled at Rafin and every tove gyred.\n6. Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all toves gyred.\n\nThus, the final answer is statements 1 and 6.",

Every tove is uffish or not all toves will whiffle.\n4. If Bungo is a borogove, then Zindle isn't a borogove.\n5. Rafin gimbled and every tove will whiffle.\n6. Zindle isn't mimsy and Bungo isn't mimsy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: There is a borogove that every borogove snicker-snacked. This implies that at least one borogove exists and that all borogoves have snicker-snacked.\n\n- **Statement 3**: Every tove is uffish or not all toves will whiffle. This is a logical disjunction. If any tove is not uffish, then not all toves will whiffle. However, statement 5 states that every tove will whiffle, which means the condition \"not all toves will whiffle\" is false. Therefore, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if every tove is uffish.\n\n- **Statement 4**: If Bungo is a borogove, then Zindle isn't a borogove. This is a conditional statement.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Rafin gimbled and every tove will whiffle. We already know from statement 3 that every tove will whiffle.\n\n- **Statement 6**: Zindle isn't mimsy and Bungo isn't mimsy. This information doesn't directly affect the logical deductions about toves, borogoves, or raths.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.**  \n   This is a contradiction. A borogove cannot both burble and not burble. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **No toves are uffish.**  \n   From statement 3, we deduced that every tove must be uffish to satisfy the condition given that every tove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Only toves are uffish.**  \n   We know every tove is uffish, but we have no information about whether raths or borogoves can be uffish. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Not all toves are uffish.**  \n   We deduced that every tove is uffish, so this statement is false.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**  \n   Since every tove will whiffle (from statement 5), if Zindle is a tove, then Zindle will whiffle. However, we don't have information about Zindle's classification. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true without additional information.\n\n6. **Every tove is uffish.**  \n   From our analysis of statement 3, we concluded that every tove must be uffish to satisfy the condition given that every tove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n6. Every tove is uffish.",

Rafin is a tove.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **A borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This statement implies that there is at least one borogove that chortled at all other borogoves. However, the given information only states that every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it, not necessarily at every borogove. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n2. **No borogoves chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This statement is the negation of statement 1. Since statement 1 is not necessarily true, this statement could be true, but it is not guaranteed by the given information. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n3. **A borogove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - The given information states that every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.

Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Every borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - The given information does not state that every borogove chortled at every other borogove, only that they chortled at those that chortled at them. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.**\n   - This is directly stated in the given information. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Every borogove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - For every borogove to chortle at a borogove, there must be at least one borogove that chortled at another borogove, which is supported by statement 3. However, the given information does not guarantee that every borogove chortled at another borogove, only that they chortled at those that chortled at them. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n\n- **Statement 3: A borogove chortled at a borogove.**\n- **Statement 5: A borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.**\n\nThese are the statements that are necessarily true given the conditions provided.",

If Zindle is not a borogove, the statement doesn't provide information about whether Zindle gyred or not.\n\n4. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This is a logical equivalence: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true if and only if \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true.

If not all borogoves are mimsy, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Rafin gimbled**: This is a direct statement, so Rafin is a rath (since only raths gimbled).\n\n- **Rafin and Zindle are uffish**: This means both Rafin and Zindle are either toves or borogoves, as only toves and borogoves can be uffish.\n\n- **Rafin is a rath**: From the above, Rafin cannot be a tove or a borogove. This seems contradictory unless we consider the possibility of Rafin being both a rath and uffish, which is not explicitly ruled out by the problem.\n\n- **If not all borogoves are mimsy, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin**: This is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n  - If not all borogoves are mimsy, then:\n    - A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin.\n  - This implies that if Rafin snicker-snacked himself, no borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Rafin gimbled but it is not the case that Rafin isn't uffish.**\n   - Rafin gimbled (true).\n   - Rafin is uffish (true, given).\n   - This statement is true.\n\n2. **Rafin and Zindle gimbled.**\n   - Rafin gimbled (true).\n   - Zindle gimbled (unknown, no information given).\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n3. **Zindle and Rafin gimbled.**\n   - Same as statement 2, cannot be determined as true.\n\n4. **Rafin gimbled and Rafin isn't uffish.**\n   - Rafin gimbled (true).\n   - Rafin isn't uffish (false, given).\n   - This statement is false.\n\n5. **Zindle gimbled.**\n   - No information given about Zindle gimbled.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n6. **Zindle didn't gimble.**\n   - No information given about Zindle gimbled.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. **Rafin gimbled but it is not the case that Rafin isn't uffish.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

This statement is true.\n\n3. **No toves galumphed over Zindle or no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - This is a logical disjunction. We know \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle,\" which means at least one tove did not galumph over Zindle. Therefore, the first part of the disjunction is true, making the entire statement true regardless of the second part.\n\n4. **No toves galumphed over Zindle unless no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. The contrapositive is: \"If borogoves are beamish, then some toves galumphed over Zindle.\" Since borogoves are indeed beamish, for the statement to be true, some toves must have galumphed over Zindle. However, we know \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle,\" so it's possible that no toves galumphed over Zindle. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - Since only borogoves are beamish and Zindle is not specified as a borogove, Zindle cannot be beamish. This statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - Since only borogoves are beamish, and neither Zindle nor Rafin is specified as borogoves, neither can be beamish. This statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Only borogoves are beamish and not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\n2. Zindle isn't beamish.\n3. No toves galumphed over Zindle or no borogoves are beamish.\n\nThus, the correct answer is statements 1, 2, and 3.",

A tove galumphed over Rafin only if not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\n6. If Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n7. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Rafin won't whiffle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2** tells us that all borogoves will whiffle.\n- **Statement 3** tells us that all borogoves are uffish.\n- **Statement 4** is a fact about Rafin and Bungo, but it doesn't directly affect the whiffling or galumphing conditions.\n- **Statement 5** is a conditional statement about toves galumphing over Rafin and Bungo.\n- **Statement 6** is a complex conditional involving Bungo, toves, and Zindle.\n- **Statement 7** is another conditional involving toves, Zindle, Rafin, and raths.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n   - We know borogoves will whiffle, but we have no information about Zindle or Bungo being borogoves. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, we have no information about Zindle or Rafin being borogoves. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.**\n   - This is directly given by statements 2 and 3. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Zindle won't whiffle.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle's type, so we cannot conclude this.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - Again, we have no information about Zindle's type, so we cannot conclude this.\n\n6. **Every borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.**\n   - This is essentially the same as statement 3, just phrased differently.

No toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This is explicitly given, so it is true.\n\n- **Statement 1**: \"Rafin chortled at every tove.\" There is no information given about Rafin's actions towards toves, so we cannot conclude this must be true.\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"A tove chortled at Rafin.\" This contradicts statement 5, which says no toves chortled at Rafin. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Rafin chortled at a tove.\" Similar to statement 1, there is no information about Rafin's actions towards toves, so we cannot conclude this must be true.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Every tove chortled at Rafin.\" This contradicts statement 5, so it cannot be true.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.\" The first part is true (no toves chortled at Rafin), but we have no information about Rafin's identity. Rafin could be a tove, borogove, or rath. Therefore, we cannot conclude the second part must be true.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"Not all toves chortled at Rafin.\" Since no toves chortled at Rafin (statement 5), it follows that not all toves chortled at Rafin.

In fact, borogoves snicker-snack toves, not the other way around. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A borogove snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - It is explicitly stated that a borogove snicker-snacked every tove. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that toves snicker-snack borogoves. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - Since there is no information about toves snicker-snacking borogoves, and borogoves snicker-snack toves, this statement could be true. However, it is not necessarily true because we don't have explicit information that toves cannot snicker-snack borogoves.\n\n5. **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - There is no information supporting this. It contradicts the known interaction where borogoves snicker-snack toves. This statement is not true.\n\n6. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - Again, there is no information supporting this. It contradicts the known interaction where borogoves snicker-snack toves. This statement is not true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**2.

Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. **Existence**: There is at least one of each: tove, borogove, and rath.\n3. **Borogoves**: Not all borogoves are beamish.\n4. **Rath Actions**: A rath galumphed over Zindle, and every rath chortled at Zindle.\n5. **Conditional Statement**: If Rafin is beamish, then every rath is beamish only if no borogoves are beamish.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"If every rath is beamish, then no borogoves are beamish only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\"\n   - We know every rath chortled at Zindle, but there's no information about Zindle chortling at itself. This statement introduces a condition (Zindle chortling at Zindle) that is not supported by the given information. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"No raths chortled at Zindle just in case no borogoves are beamish.\"\n   - We know every rath chortled at Zindle, so \"no raths chortled at Zindle\" is false. The statement is a biconditional, meaning both sides must have the same truth value. Since the left side is false, the right side must also be false, which means some borogoves are beamish. This is consistent with the information that not all borogoves are beamish. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Not all borogoves are beamish and every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n   - This statement is directly supported by the given information. We know not all borogoves are beamish, and every rath chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Zindle isn't beamish.\"\n   - There is no information given about Zindle's beamishness. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement is true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Zindle and Rafin are beamish.\"\n   - Again, there is no information about Zindle or Rafin's beamishness. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement is true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"Zindle is beamish.\"\n   - As with statement 4, there is no information about Zindle's beamishness. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"No raths chortled at Zindle just in case no borogoves are beamish.\"\n- **Statement 3**: \"Not all borogoves are beamish and every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n\nThus, the final answer is that statements 2 and 3 must be true.",

If Zindle won't burble, then not all toves chortled at Bungo only if not all toves will whiffle.\n4. If Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath chortled at Rafin only if a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n5. A borogove will burble.\n6. Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 5**: A borogove will burble. This means Zindle, if a borogove, will burble. If Zindle is not a borogove, this statement doesn't directly affect Zindle.\n\n- **Statement 6**: Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle. Since Bungo is a rath, Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n- **Statement 3**: If Zindle won't burble, then not all toves chortled at Bungo only if not all toves will whiffle. Since a borogove will burble (Statement 5), if Zindle is a borogove, Zindle will burble, making the antecedent of this conditional false, and thus the entire statement true regardless of the consequent.\n\n- **Statement 4**: If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then every rath chortled at Rafin only if a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo. This statement is complex, but we know every rath snicker-snacked Zindle (Statement 6), so if Rafin is a rath, Rafin snicker-snacked Zindle. The truth of this statement depends on the roles of Rafin and Bungo, but it doesn't directly affect Zindle's actions.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.**  \n   - False, because every rath snicker-snacked Zindle (Statement 6), and Bungo is a rath.\n\n2. **Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle.**  \n   - True, as deduced from Statement 6.\n\n3. **Zindle didn't snicker-snack Bungo.**  \n   - We don't have enough information to determine this. Zindle's role (tove, borogove, or rath) is not specified, and no information directly addresses Zindle's actions towards Bungo.\n\n4. **Zindle snicker-snacked Bungo.**  \n   - We don't have enough information to determine this for the same reasons as above.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**  \n   - We don't have enough information to determine this.

If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n- **Statement 3**: No toves chortled at Bungo. This means that Bungo cannot be a tove because a tove cannot chortle at Bungo.\n\nFrom the above, we can conclude:\n- Bungo is either a borogove or a rath.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This is a tautology. It means that either not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, or no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, or both. This statement doesn't provide additional information about chortling.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n  - This is a conditional statement. We don't have enough information to determine the truth of the antecedent (\"every rath chortled at Rafin\") or the consequent (\"Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo\").\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know Bungo chortled at Bungo, so this statement is false.\n\n2. **A tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know no toves chortled at Bungo, so this statement is false.\n\n3. **Bungo chortled at a tove.**\n   - We have no information about Bungo chortling at a tove. This cannot be determined as true.\n\n4. **Bungo chortled at every tove.**\n   - We have no information about Bungo chortling at every tove.

A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Borogoves and Uffishness**: Since every borogove is uffish and Rafin is uffish, Rafin could be a borogove. However, Rafin could also be a tove or a rath, as the information does not exclude these possibilities.\n  \n- **Zindle's Characteristics**: Zindle isn't mimsy, and a rath galumphed over Zindle. This tells us Zindle is not a rath because a rath cannot galumph over itself (as it would contradict the statement that a rath snicker-snacked itself).\n\n- **Raths**: A rath snicker-snacked itself, and a rath galumphed over Zindle. This implies there is at least one rath that is not Zindle.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Every borogove is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - We know every borogove is uffish (given) and a rath galumphed over Zindle (given). This statement is true.\n\n2. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin and every rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - This is a contradiction. It cannot be true that not all raths galumphed over Rafin and every rath galumphed over Rafin simultaneously. This statement is false.\n\n3. **Zindle and Rafin are mimsy.**\n   - Zindle is not mimsy (given). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Rafin is mimsy.**\n   - There is no information given about Rafin being mimsy or not. Rafin being uffish does not imply mimsiness.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: a tove, a borogove, and a rath.\n3. A tove chortled at every rath.\n4. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.\"\n\n  This statement implies a conditional relationship: if a borogove snicker-snacks a tove, then that tove must snicker-snack that borogove. However, it does not imply that a tove snicker-snacks a borogove unless the borogove first snicker-snacks the tove.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n1. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n\n   This statement suggests that there is at least one tove that snicker-snacked all borogoves. However, the given information does not provide any basis for a tove snicker-snacking a borogove unless the borogove first snicker-snacked the tove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n\n   This statement suggests that each tove snicker-snacked at least one borogove. Again, the given information does not guarantee that any borogove snicker-snacked a tove, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n\n   This statement is stronger than statement 1 and implies that each tove snicker-snacked all borogoves. There is no information to support this, as it requires every borogove to snicker-snack every tove, which is not given. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.**\n\n   This statement directly reflects the given information in statement 4. It is explicitly stated as a condition, so this statement must be true.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n\n   This statement suggests that there is at least one instance of a tove snicker-snacking a borogove. However, without any borogove snicker-snacking a tove, this cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n\n   This statement is the negation of statement 3. Since statement 3 is not necessarily true, this statement could be true, but it is not guaranteed by the given information. Therefore, it is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n4.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No toves snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked it.\n3. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked every tove.\n4. A rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked a borogove.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n- **Condition 2**: If a borogove snicker-snacked a tove, then that tove cannot snicker-snack that borogove. This implies a one-way relationship where if a borogove snicker-snacks a tove, the reverse cannot happen.\n\n- **Condition 3**: If a borogove snicker-snacked every tove, then every tove must snicker-snack that borogove. This implies that if a borogove has snicker-snacked all toves, then all toves must reciprocate snicker-snacking that particular borogove.\n\n- **Condition 4**: There exists at least one rath that snicker-snacked a tove, and that tove snicker-snacked a borogove. This implies a chain: rath \u2192 tove \u2192 borogove.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n1. **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This cannot be true because of Condition 2. If a borogove snicker-snacked a tove, that tove cannot snicker-snack the borogove.\n\n2. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This is possible. If a tove snicker-snacked every borogove, then by Condition 2, no borogove could snicker-snack that tove. However, Condition 3 allows for a borogove to snicker-snack every tove, which would require all toves to snicker-snack that borogove. This creates a contradiction if a single tove snicker-snacked every borogove. Thus, no tove can snicker-snack every borogove.\n\n3. **No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. Condition 3 allows for toves to snicker-snack borogoves, provided those borogoves do not snicker-snack the toves.\n\n4. **No borogoves snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. Condition 3 allows for a borogove to snicker-snack every tove, provided every tove snicker-snacks that borogove.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. As discussed in statement 2, if a tove snicker-snacked every borogove, it would contradict Condition 2 if any borogove snicker-snacked that tove.\n\n6. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. There is no condition that requires every tove to snicker-snack at least one borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**2.

If rath \\( R_1 \\) chortled at rath \\( R_2 \\), then \\( R_2 \\) must have chortled at \\( R_1 \\).

A borogove chortled at a tove that chortled at a borogove.\n5. If Bungo isn't a borogove, then no borogoves are mimsy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"No toves chortled at Zindle.\" This directly tells us that statement 3 (\"A tove chortled at Zindle\") is false.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Every tove chortled at Zindle.\" This is also false because no toves chortled at Zindle.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"Not all toves chortled at Zindle.\" This must be true because we know from statement 3 that no toves chortled at Zindle, which means not all toves chortled at Zindle.\n\n- **Statement 1**: \"Zindle chortled at a tove.\" There is no information given that directly supports or contradicts this statement. It could be true or false, but it is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"Zindle is mimsy.\" The information about mimsy relates to borogoves and Bungo.

It could be true or false, but it is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n5.

It is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo (which means Bungo chortled at Bungo).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: A borogove chortled at Rafin. This means Rafin is not a borogove because a borogove cannot chortle at itself (as per the exclusive nature of the categories).\n\n- **Statement 3**: Every borogove chortled at every rath that chortled at every tove. This implies a chain of chortling: if a rath chortled at a tove, then every borogove chortled at that rath.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Bungo chortled at Bungo. This means Bungo is not a borogove because a borogove cannot chortle at itself.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know a borogove chortled at Rafin, but we have no information about Rafin chortling at himself or a borogove chortling at Bungo.

However, we have no information about Rafin chortling at Bungo.

This statement is true.\n\n4. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - This is equivalent to saying a borogove chortled at Rafin and Rafin chortled at Bungo. We have no information about Rafin chortling at Bungo.

Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n\n2. **Statements**:\n   - No toves galumphed over Bungo.\n   - Zindle is uffish.\n   - A rath is uffish.\n   - Rafin isn't a tove.\n   - Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.\n   - A borogove galumphed over Rafin.\n   - Every borogove chortled at Bungo unless every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   - No borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- **Zindle is uffish** and **a rath is uffish**. Since Rafin isn't a tove, Rafin could be a borogove or a rath. If Rafin were a rath, Rafin would be uffish, making statement 1 true. However, we need to determine if this must be true.\n\n- **No toves galumphed over Bungo**. This is a direct statement.\n\n- **A borogove galumphed over Rafin**. This implies Rafin is not a borogove, as a borogove cannot galumph over itself. Since Rafin isn't a tove, Rafin must be a rath.\n\n- **Every borogove chortled at Bungo unless every tove snicker-snacked Zindle**. This means if not every tove snicker-snacked Zindle, then every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n- **No borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin**. This implies if Rafin did not snicker-snack Rafin, then some borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n1. **Zindle and Rafin are uffish**: We know Zindle is uffish and Rafin is a rath, which is uffish. This statement is true.\n\n2. **A rath galumphed over Bungo or every tove is uffish**: We know no toves galumphed over Bungo. If a rath galumphed over Bungo, this would be true. However, we don't have enough information to confirm this must be true.\n\n3. **A rath galumphed over Bungo unless no toves are uffish**: This is equivalent to saying if any tove is uffish, then a rath galumphed over Bungo. We don't have enough information to confirm this must be true.\n\n4. **No toves galumphed over Bungo and a rath is uffish**: We know both parts are true. This statement is true.\n\n5. **A rath galumphed over Bungo or no toves are uffish**: We don't have enough information to confirm this must be true.\n\n6. **A rath galumphed over Bungo unless every tove is uffish**: This is equivalent to saying if not every tove is uffish, then a rath galumphed over Bungo. We don't have enough information to confirm this must be true.\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n1. Zindle and Rafin are uffish.\n4.

It can be broken down into two implications:\n    - If not all raths gimbled, then no raths chortled at Rafin.\n    - If no raths chortled at Rafin, then not all raths gimbled.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"Rafin gimbled.\"\n  - Since Rafin gimbled, we need to consider the implications of this fact in relation to Statement 4.\n  - If Rafin gimbled, then it is possible that some raths gimbled. However, we need to determine if any raths chortled at Rafin.\n\n- **Statement 4 Analysis**:\n  - Since Rafin gimbled, for the biconditional to hold, it must be true that some raths chortled at Rafin (otherwise, the \"if and only if\" condition would be violated because \"not all raths gimbled\" would imply \"no raths chortled at Rafin,\" which contradicts the fact that some raths must have chortled at Rafin for Rafin to gimbled).\n\n- **Conclusion from Statement 4**:\n  - Since some raths chortled at Rafin, it follows that all raths gimbled (because if no raths chortled at Rafin, then not all raths gimbled, but we know some did chortle at Rafin).\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle gimbled.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle gimbled.

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **No raths snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This contradicts statement 3. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **No raths snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.**\n   - This contradicts statement 3, which implies mutual snicker-snacking among raths. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine whether Zindle is a rath or not, nor do we know if not all raths chortled at Bungo. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle will burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n3. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all raths will whiffle.\n3. Not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n4. No toves chortled at Bungo.\n5. Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\n6. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 4** states that no toves chortled at Bungo. This means that statement 5, \"Not all raths will whiffle and no toves chortled at Bungo,\" is partially true because the second part (\"no toves chortled at Bungo\") is true. However, we need to verify the first part (\"not all raths will whiffle\") to determine if the entire statement is true.\n\n- **Condition 2** states that not all raths will whiffle. This confirms the first part of statement 5, making the entire statement 5 true.\n\n- **Condition 6** involves a conditional statement: \"If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\"\n\n  - We know from **Condition 4** that no toves chortled at Bungo, but this doesn't directly affect the galumphing condition.\n  - The condition \"if not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is not directly contradicted by any given information, so it could be true.\n  - If this condition is true, then \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every rath chortled at Bungo\" must hold.\n  - However, we don't have information about whether every rath chortled at Bungo, so we cannot definitively conclude anything about Bungo galumphing over Zindle.\n\n- **Whiffling Conditions:**\n\n  - **Condition 2** states that not all raths will whiffle, which means at least one rath does not whiffle.\n  - There is no direct information about Bungo or Zindle whiffling.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n1. **Bungo and Zindle will whiffle.**  \n   - We have no information confirming that both Bungo and Zindle will whiffle.\n\n2. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**  \n   - This is the same as statement 1, just in reverse order. No information confirms this.\n\n3. **Zindle won't whiffle.**  \n   - We have no information confirming that Zindle won't whiffle.\n\n4. **Bungo will whiffle.**  \n   - We have no information confirming that Bungo will whiffle.\n\n5. **Not all raths will whiffle and no toves chortled at Bungo.**  \n   - This statement is true based on Conditions 2 and 4.\n\n6. **Zindle will whiffle.**  \n   - We have no information confirming that Zindle will whiffle.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n5.

There is at least one of each.\n\n2. **Borogoves and Mimsy**: Only borogoves are mimsy.\n\n3. **Toves and Chortling**: Every tove chortled at Bungo.\n\n4. **Conditional Chortling**: Every tove chortled at Bungo only if Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin.\n\n5. **Zindle's Condition**: Zindle isn't a borogove unless only toves gyred.\n\n6. **Bungo's Action**: Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n\n7. **Toves and Whiffling**: Every tove will whiffle.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- Since every tove chortled at Bungo, and this is true only if Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin, it follows that Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin. Therefore, statement 5 (\"Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin\") must be true.\n\n- Since every tove will whiffle, and there is at least one tove, at least one entity will whiffle.\n\n- Zindle's classification depends on whether only toves gyred. However, there is no information about gyred, so we cannot determine Zindle's classification based on this condition alone.\n\n- Bungo chortled at Zindle, but this does not directly affect Zindle's ability to whiffle.\n\n- Since every tove will whiffle, and we know there is at least one tove, we can conclude that at least one entity (a tove) will whiffle. However, we don't have enough information to determine if Zindle is a tove or not.\n\n- Since Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin, and every tove chortled at Bungo, it follows that every tove chortled at Bungo is consistent with the given conditions.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Zindle won't whiffle**: We cannot definitively say this because we don't know Zindle's classification.\n\n2. **Zindle will whiffle**: We cannot definitively say this because we don't know Zindle's classification.\n\n3. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle**: We cannot definitively say this because we don't know Zindle's classification, and we don't have information about Rafin whiffling.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle**: We cannot definitively say this because we don't know Zindle's classification, and we don't have information about Bungo whiffling.\n\n5. **Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin**: This must be true, as deduced from the condition that every tove chortled at Bungo only if Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin.\n\n6. **Rafin chortled at Rafin**: This is false, as we have already established that Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true is:\n\n5.

Therefore, statement 1 (\"A borogove snicker-snacked a rath\") must also be true because if every borogove did so, then at least one did.\n\n- **Statement 2** (\"There is a borogove that every rath snicker-snacked\") is not supported by the given information. We only know that every borogove snicker-snacked a rath, but not that any rath snicker-snacked a borogove.\n\n- **Statement 3** (\"No borogoves snicker-snacked a rath\") directly contradicts the given information that every borogove snicker-snacked a rath. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 4** (\"No borogoves snicker-snacked every rath\") is possible. The information only states that every borogove snicker-snacked at least one rath, not necessarily every rath. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n- **Statement 5** (\"A borogove snicker-snacked every rath\") is not necessarily true. The information does not specify that any borogove snicker-snacked all raths, only that each borogove snicker-snacked at least one rath.\n\n- **Statement 6** (\"Every borogove snicker-snacked every rath\") is not supported by the given information. We only know that each borogove snicker-snacked at least one rath, not all raths.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. A borogove snicker-snacked a rath.\n\nThus, the final answer is statement 1.",

Bungo chortled at every rath.\n5. Bungo snicker-snacked a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Bungo chortled at every rath**: This means Bungo cannot be a borogove because no borogoves chortled at a rath.\n- **Bungo snicker-snacked a rath**: This action does not directly affect the classification of Bungo as a tove, borogove, or rath, but it confirms Bungo interacted with a rath.\n\nFrom the above, we can conclude:\n- Bungo is not a borogove.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This is a contradiction.

Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.\n6. Rafin is a tove or Rafin will whiffle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: Rafin won't whiffle. This is a direct statement about Rafin.\n\n- **Statement 6**: Rafin is a tove or Rafin will whiffle. Since we know from Statement 2 that Rafin won't whiffle, the only way for this statement to be true is if Rafin is a tove. Therefore, Rafin must be a tove.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove. Since Rafin is a tove (from the analysis above), Rafin cannot be a borogove. This is consistent with the statement that Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove, as Rafin is not one of them.\n\n- **Statement 4**: Every rath galumphed over Rafin. Since Rafin is a tove, and every rath galumphed over Rafin, Rafin cannot be a rath. This is consistent with Rafin being a tove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom the analysis, we have determined that Rafin must be a tove. Therefore, the statement that must be true is:\n\n3. Rafin is a tove.\n\n### Verification of Other Statements:\n\n- **Statement 1**: Zindle won't whiffle. We have no information about Zindle's whiffling status directly, so we cannot conclude this must be true.\n\n- **Statement 2**: Zindle will whiffle. Again, we have no information about Zindle's whiffling status directly, so we cannot conclude this must be true.\n\n- **Statement 4**: Rafin will whiffle. This contradicts Statement 2, which states Rafin won't whiffle. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Rafin isn't a tove. This contradicts our conclusion that Rafin is a tove. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n- **Statement 6**: Zindle and Rafin will whiffle. This contradicts Statement 2, which states Rafin won't whiffle.

Zindle isn't a borogove or every tove is uffish.\n6. Every tove is uffish unless a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2** tells us Zindle is a tove.\n- **Statement 3** tells us Zindle galumphed over Zindle. This is a tautology since Zindle galumphing over itself doesn't provide new information about other entities.\n- **Statement 4** tells us that a tove is uffish. This implies that all toves are uffish.\n- **Statement 5** is a conditional: \"Zindle isn't a borogove or every tove is uffish.\" Since Zindle is a tove (from Statement 2), Zindle cannot be a borogove. Therefore, the statement \"Zindle isn't a borogove\" is true, making the entire disjunction true regardless of the second part. However, since we know all toves are uffish (from Statement 4), the second part \"every tove is uffish\" is also true.\n- **Statement 6** provides a condition: \"Every tove is uffish unless a rath galumphed over Zindle.\" Since we know from Statement 4 that every tove is uffish, the condition \"unless a rath galumphed over Zindle\" must be false. Therefore, no rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - Since Zindle is a tove and all toves are uffish (Statement 4), Zindle must be uffish. This statement is true.\n\n2. **No toves galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - We know Zindle galumphed over Zindle (Statement 3), and Zindle is a tove. Therefore, at least one tove (Zindle) galumphed over Zindle. This statement is false.\n\n3. **A tove galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - As established, Zindle (a tove) galumphed over Zindle. This statement is true.\n\n4. **Zindle galumphed over every tove.**\n   - We only know Zindle galumphed over itself. There is no information to suggest Zindle galumphed over every tove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Not all toves galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - We only know Zindle galumphed over itself.

Zindle could be a tove, borogove, or rath, and none of these roles inherently guarantee the ability to whiffle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 2: Zindle won't whiffle.**\n     - Similar to Statement 1, we lack information about Zindle's ability to whiffle. Zindle could potentially whiffle if Zindle is a tove and belongs to the subset of toves that can whiffle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 3: Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n     - Since Rafin is a tove, and no toves chortled at a tove that chortled at it, Rafin cannot chortle at himself. This statement must be true.\n\n   - **Statement 4: Rafin will whiffle.**\n     - We know not all toves will whiffle, which implies some toves cannot whiffle. Since we have no specific information about Rafin's ability to whiffle, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n   - **Statement 5: Rafin chortled at Rafin.**\n     - As established in Statement 3, Rafin cannot chortle at himself because he is a tove. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n   - **Statement 6: Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n     - We have no information about Zindle's ability to whiffle, and we know not all toves will whiffle, so Rafin might not be able to whiffle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n   **3. Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin.**",

It is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 4**: \"It is not the case that Rafin is a tove\" implies Rafin is not a tove.\n- **Condition 2**: \"Rafin is a tove unless Bungo isn't a borogove\" can be rewritten as \"If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Rafin isn't a tove.\" Since Rafin isn't a tove (from Condition 4), this condition is satisfied regardless of whether Bungo is a borogove or not.\n- **Condition 6**: \"It is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish\" implies Rafin is beamish.\n- **Condition 3**: \"A rath is beamish\" and since Rafin is beamish, Rafin could be a rath.\n- **Condition 5**: \"Zindle isn't beamish\" implies Zindle cannot be a rath.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- Since Rafin is beamish and a rath is beamish, Rafin must be a rath.\n- Zindle isn't beamish, so Zindle cannot be a rath.\n- There must be at least one of each type (tove, borogove, rath).

A borogove cannot both burble and not burble at the same time. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know from the conditions that no toves chortled at Bungo. Therefore, \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true. However, it is given that Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle, so \"it is not the case that Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\" is false. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know that no toves chortled at Bungo, which is true. However, there is no information given about Bungo snicker-snacking Zindle. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Both parts of this statement are given as true: Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle, and no toves chortled at Bungo. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know no toves chortled at Bungo, so \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true.

The second part (\"Rafin galumphed over Rafin\") is not addressed in the given information. However, since the statement is an \"or\" statement, it could be true if Rafin galumphed over Rafin.

If Rafin is not a tove, then Zindle must not have chortled at Rafin for the statement to be true.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This is a conjunction of two facts: \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" and \"Rafin chortled at Zindle.\" Both are given as true.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts the given fact that Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n\n5. **Rafin is a tove or it is not the case that Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n   - This can be rewritten as: Rafin is a tove or Zindle chortled at Rafin.\n   - If Rafin is a tove, the statement is true. If Rafin is not a tove, then Zindle must have chortled at Rafin for the statement to be true.\n\n6. **If Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle, then a tove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. Since no toves chortled at Rafin, the antecedent \"Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle\" must be false for the statement to be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3. No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n\nThis statement is a conjunction of two facts that are explicitly given as true in the problem.",

Therefore, Rafin is either a borogove or a rath.\n- **Rafin's Chortling**: Rafin chortled at Bungo.\n- **Bungo's Chortling**: Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating the Conditional Statement:\n\n- **If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo**: This implies that every rath has snicker-snacked Bungo.\n- **Then Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo only if every rath galumphed over Rafin**: This is a conditional statement. For it to hold, if every rath galumphed over Rafin, then Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo. Since Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo (as it didn't chortle at itself), it implies that every rath must have galumphed over Rafin.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Rafin's Identity**: Rafin isn't a tove, so Rafin is either a borogove or a rath.\n- **Rafin's Chortling**: Rafin chortled at Bungo.\n- **Bungo's Chortling**: Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know Rafin chortled at Bungo, but we don't have information about all toves chortling at Bungo.\n\n2. **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - Both parts are true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - Rafin did chortle at Bungo, so this is false.\n\n4. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - Rafin isn't a tove, but we don't have information about all toves chortling at Bungo.\n\n5. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and no toves chortled at Rafin.**\n   - We don't have information about toves chortling at Rafin.\n\n6. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - Rafin isn't a tove, so this is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n**2.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: tove, borogove, and rath.\n3. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n4. A borogove will whiffle.\n5. Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\n6. If every rath snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 4**: A borogove will whiffle. This means that if something is a borogove, it will whiffle.\n- **Statement 5**: Every borogove chortled at Zindle. This means that if something is a borogove, it chortled at Zindle.\n- **Statement 3**: Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. This implies that at least one tove did not snicker-snack Zindle.\n- **Statement 6**: If every rath snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin. This is a logical contradiction, implying that not every rath snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n1. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - We know that borogoves will whiffle, but there is no information about Zindle or Rafin themselves whiffling. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know every borogove chortled at Zindle, but not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. The \"if and only if\" condition requires both directions to be true. Since not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, it doesn't imply that no toves did, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A borogove chortled at Zindle just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - \"Just in case\" is equivalent to \"if and only if.\" We know every borogove chortled at Zindle, and not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. However, the chortling of borogoves is independent of the toves' actions, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Zindle won't whiffle.**\n   - There is no information about Zindle whiffling or not whiffling. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - Similar to statement 4, there is no information about Zindle whiffling. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - There is no information about Rafin whiffling. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nNone of the statements must be true based on the given information.

Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and there is at least one of each.\n\n2. **Conditions**:\n   - Not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n   - A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n   - A rath galumphed over Bungo only if every tove chortled at Bungo.\n   - If Zindle gimbled, then no borogoves are beamish only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\n   - If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if Bungo galumphed over Zindle.\n   - If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- **Condition 1**: Not all toves chortled at Bungo. This implies that at least one tove did not chortle at Bungo.\n\n- **Condition 2**: A rath galumphed over Zindle. This is a given fact.\n\n- **Condition 3**: A rath galumphed over Bungo only if every tove chortled at Bungo. Since not all toves chortled at Bungo (from Condition 1), it follows that no rath galumphed over Bungo.\n\n- **Condition 4**: If Zindle gimbled, then no borogoves are beamish only if every rath galumphed over Rafin. This is a conditional statement that doesn't directly affect the other conditions unless Zindle gimbled, which we don't have information about.\n\n- **Condition 5**: If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if Bungo galumphed over Zindle. Since not all toves chortled at Bungo, this implies that if Bungo did not galumph over Zindle, then all toves must have galumphed over Zindle.\n\n- **Condition 6**: If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo. This condition is contingent on Bungo being beamish, which we don't have information about.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Zindle gimbled**: We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n\n2. **Bungo galumphed over every rath**: We know from Condition 3 that no rath galumphed over Bungo, but this doesn't imply anything about Bungo galumphing over raths.\n\n3. **No raths galumphed over Bungo**: This must be true based on Condition 3, as not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n4. **Every rath galumphed over Bungo**: This contradicts Condition 3, so it cannot be true.\n\n5. **A rath galumphed over Bungo**: This contradicts Condition 3, so it cannot be true.\n\n6. **Bungo galumphed over a rath**: We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n3. **No raths galumphed over Bungo.**",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine which, if any, must be true based on the conditions provided.\n\n### Given Conditions:\n\n1. Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\n3. A rath galumphed over Bungo or a borogove galumphed over Rafin.\n4. A rath will burble unless not all raths chortled at Bungo.\n5. Every tove will burble unless not all raths chortled at Bungo.\n6. If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 2** states that every tove snicker-snacked every borogove. This means that for any tove \\( T \\) and any borogove \\( B \\), \\( T \\) snicker-snacked \\( B \\).\n\n- **Condition 3** gives us two possibilities: either a rath galumphed over Bungo, or a borogove galumphed over Rafin (or both).\n\n- **Conditions 4 and 5** are equivalent in terms of their dependency on whether all raths chortled at Bungo. If all raths chortled at Bungo, then every rath and every tove will burble. If not all raths chortled at Bungo, then no rath will burble, and no tove will burble.\n\n- **Condition 6** provides a conditional statement about borogoves snicker-snacking Bungo and Rafin.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin and every rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - This is a contradiction. If every rath galumphed over Rafin, then it cannot be true that not all raths galumphed over Rafin. This statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This contradicts Condition 2, which states that every tove snicker-snacked every borogove. This statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This is consistent with Condition 2, which states that every tove snicker-snacked every borogove. This statement must be true.\n\n4. **Not all toves will whiffle and every tove will whiffle.**\n   - This is a contradiction. If every tove will whiffle, then it cannot be true that not all toves will whiffle. This statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This contradicts Condition 2, which states that every tove snicker-snacked every borogove. This statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.**\n   - Condition 2 states that every tove snicker-snacked every borogove, but it does not imply that every borogove snicker-snacked any particular tove. This statement is not necessarily true based on the given conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**",

If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if no borogoves are beamish.\n3. Every rath gimbled and a rath is beamish.\n4. Bungo isn't mimsy.\n5. Rafin isn't beamish.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 3** tells us that every rath gimbled and a rath is beamish. This means all raths have the property of gimbled and beamish.\n\n- **Statement 5** tells us Rafin isn't beamish. Since a rath is beamish, Rafin cannot be a rath.\n\n- **Statement 4** tells us Bungo isn't mimsy. This doesn't directly affect the gimbled property but is useful for elimination.\n\n- **Statement 1** involves a conditional about borogoves and Rafin. Since Rafin isn't beamish, if a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then no borogoves are beamish. However, this doesn't directly affect the gimbled property.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Every rath gimbled but it is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy.**\n   - We know every rath gimbled (from Statement 3). However, Bungo isn't mimsy (from Statement 4), so this statement is false.\n\n2. **Rafin gimbled.**\n   - Rafin isn't a rath (since Rafin isn't beamish), and only raths gimbled. Therefore, Rafin did not gimbled. This statement is false.\n\n3. **Bungo gimbled.**\n   - We don't have information about Bungo being a rath. Bungo could be a tove or a borogove, neither of which gimbled. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Rafin didn't gimble.**\n   - As deduced, Rafin isn't a rath, so Rafin didn't gimbled.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\n3. A tove chortled at every rath that chortled at it.\n4. A tove chortled at a borogove that chortled at a borogove.\n5. Every borogove chortled at every tove that chortled at every borogove.\n6. A borogove chortled at Zindle just in case not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 2** states that every borogove chortled at every borogove. This means that for any borogove \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\), \\( B_1 \\) chortled at \\( B_2 \\).\n\n- **Condition 4** states that a tove chortled at a borogove that chortled at a borogove. Since every borogove chortled at every borogove (from Condition 2), this means every tove chortled at every borogove.\n\n- **Condition 5** states that every borogove chortled at every tove that chortled at every borogove. Since every tove chortled at every borogove (from Condition 4), every borogove chortled at every tove.\n\n- **Condition 6** introduces a conditional statement about Zindle. A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin. This condition does not provide direct information about the nature of Zindle or the actions of borogoves unless we know about the galumphing over Rafin.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **No borogoves chortled at a borogove.**\n   - This is false because Condition 2 states that every borogove chortled at every borogove.\n\n2. **No borogoves chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This is false because Condition 2 states that every borogove chortled at every borogove.\n\n3. **No borogoves chortled at a borogove that chortled at it.**\n   - This is false because every borogove chortled at every borogove, including itself.\n\n4. **A borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This is true because Condition 2 states that every borogove chortled at every borogove.\n\n5. **Zindle is a tove.**\n   - There is no information given that directly determines Zindle's identity as a tove. The condition about Zindle is conditional and does not provide a definitive answer.\n\n6. **There is not a borogove that every borogove chortled at.**\n   - This is false because every borogove chortled at every borogove, including each individual borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n4.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Zindle chortled at a tove.**\n   - Since Zindle chortled at every tove, Zindle must have chortled at at least one tove.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Only toves are beamish.\n3. Not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin.\n4. Bungo isn't a borogove only if every tove chortled at Bungo.\n5. If a tove galumphed over Bungo, then Zindle isn't a borogove.\n6. A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n7. Rafin is not a tove.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Condition 2**: Only toves are beamish. This means if something is beamish, it must be a tove.\n\n- **Condition 7**: Rafin is not a tove. Therefore, Rafin cannot be beamish (from Condition 2).\n\n- **Condition 6**: A rath galumphed over Zindle. This implies Zindle is not a rath (since a rath cannot galumph over itself).\n\n- **Condition 5**: If a tove galumphed over Bungo, then Zindle isn't a borogove. We don't have direct information about a tove galumphing over Bungo, so we can't directly conclude Zindle's type from this condition alone.\n\n- **Condition 3**: Not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin. This implies at least one borogove did not galumph over Rafin.\n\n- **Condition 4**: Bungo isn't a borogove only if every tove chortled at Bungo. This is a conditional statement that we need to consider carefully.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n1. **Rafin's Type**: Since Rafin is not a tove (Condition 7), Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n2. **Rafin's Beamishness**: Since Rafin is not a tove, Rafin cannot be beamish (Condition 2).\n\n3. **Zindle's Type**: \n   - Zindle cannot be a rath (Condition 6).\n   - If a tove galumphed over Bungo, then Zindle isn't a borogove (Condition 5). We don't have direct information about a tove galumphing over Bungo, so we can't conclude Zindle's type from this alone.\n   - If Zindle were a borogove, then a rath galumphed over Zindle (Condition 6), which is consistent. However, if Zindle were a tove, it could be beamish.\n\n4. **Bungo's Type**:\n   - If Bungo is a borogove, then not every tove chortled at Bungo (Condition 4).\n   - If Bungo is not a borogove, then every tove chortled at Bungo (Condition 4).\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish**: Rafin cannot be beamish (not a tove), so this is false.\n\n2. **Rafin isn't beamish**: True, as Rafin is not a tove.\n\n3. **Zindle is beamish**: Zindle could be a tove, but we don't have enough information to confirm this. So, this is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Rafin is beamish**: False, as Rafin is not a tove.\n\n5. **Zindle and Bungo are beamish**: We don't have enough information to confirm both are toves, so this is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Zindle isn't beamish**: We don't have enough information to confirm Zindle isn't a tove, so this is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n2. **Rafin isn't beamish.**",

Since Rafin is a borogove, Rafin will burble.\n\n- **Statement 4** (\"Every tove is uffish unless every borogove chortled at Bungo\") implies that if not every borogove chortled at Bungo, then every tove is uffish. Since it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo (Statement 4), and there is no information suggesting that every borogove chortled at Bungo, we can conclude that every tove is uffish.\n\n- **Statement 6** (\"If Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves are beamish\") is a conditional statement. Since only borogoves are beamish, it is impossible for all toves to be beamish.

Only borogoves are beamish, but borogoves will burble (Statement 7).\n\n2. **Rafin won't burble.**\n   - False.

This directly impacts the conclusions related to Bungo and toves.\n\n- **Statement 4** tells us that a tove chortled at a tove that chortled at a rath. This implies a chain of chortling involving toves and a rath, but it does not involve Bungo directly.\n\n- **Statement 7** provides a conditional: Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle or a rath is beamish.

This means no borogoves or raths can be mimsy.\n\n3. **Borogoves and Mimsy**: No borogoves are mimsy. This is consistent with the statement that only toves are mimsy.\n\n4. **Snicker-snacked Condition**: If no borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin. Since no borogoves are mimsy, it follows that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n5. **Bungo's Snicker-snacking**: Not all toves will whiffle, but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo. This implies that Bungo did snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n6. **Whiffle Condition**: Not all borogoves will whiffle.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Only borogoves will whiffle and not all toves will whiffle.**\n   - We know not all toves will whiffle, but we don't have information that only borogoves will whiffle. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Not all toves will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - We know not all toves will whiffle, but we only know that not all borogoves will whiffle, not that no borogoves will whiffle. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Not all toves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - We know both of these conditions are true based on the given information.

If a rath \\( R_1 \\) snicker-snacked another rath \\( R_2 \\), then \\( R_2 \\) must also snicker-snack \\( R_1 \\).\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n1. **Every rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. There could be a rath that did not snicker-snack any other rath.\n\n2. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. There is no information suggesting that any single rath snicker-snacked all other raths.\n\n3. **A rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This must be true. Since there is at least one rath, and the rule involves raths snicker-snacking other raths, there must be at least one instance where a rath snicker-snacked another rath.\n\n4. **Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The rule only states that if a rath snicker-snacked another, it must be snicker-snacked back, not that every rath snicker-snacked every other rath.\n\n5. **No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. It is possible for a rath to snicker-snack every other rath, though not required by the given information.\n\n6. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.**\n   - This must be true by the definition of the snicker-snacking rule.

Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" This directly tells us that no borogove can snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"A borogove will burble.\" This is a standalone fact about borogoves.\n\n- **Statement 7**: \"Bungo is a rath.\" This identifies Bungo's type.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - There is no information given about Zindle being a borogove. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle will burble.\n\n2. **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 2, which says no borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n3. **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This is consistent with Statement 2, which states that no borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to analyze the given statements and deduce which, if any, of the provided conclusions must be true.\n\n### Given Information:\n\n1. Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there is at least one of each.\n2. Every borogove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked every rath.\n3. Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.\n4. Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\n5. No toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked every rath.\"\n  - This implies a chain of snicker-snacking: if a borogove snicker-snacked a rath, then every borogove snicker-snacked that borogove.\n  - If Bungo is a borogove and snicker-snacked a rath, then every borogove, including Zindle, must have snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n  - If Bungo is a borogove and didn't snicker-snack Zindle, then Bungo cannot have snicker-snacked a rath (because then every borogove, including Zindle, would have snicker-snacked Bungo, contradicting the statement).\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\"\n  - This means Zindle is not a borogove because a borogove cannot chortle at another borogove.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n  - This implies Bungo is not a tove because a tove cannot chortle at another tove.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- **Bungo's Identity**:\n  - Bungo is not a tove (from Statement 5).\n  - Bungo is not a borogove (from Statement 3, because if Bungo were a borogove, then Zindle would have snicker-snacked Bungo).\n  - Therefore, Bungo must be a rath.\n\n- **Zindle's Identity**:\n  - Zindle is not a borogove (from Statement 4).\n  - Zindle could be a tove or a rath.\n\n- **Snicker-snacking Chain**:\n  - Since Bungo is a rath and didn't snicker-snack Zindle, Zindle cannot be a rath (because if Zindle were a rath, Bungo would have snicker-snacked Zindle).\n  - Therefore, Zindle must be a tove.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Not all toves will whiffle and every tove will whiffle.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\n2. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle, so this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle.**\n   - Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle (since Zindle is a tove and toves don't snicker-snack themselves), so this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle (true), and no toves chortled at Bungo (true from Statement 5). This statement is true.\n\n5. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle.**\n   - Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle (true), and since Zindle is a tove and no toves chortled at Bungo, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Both parts are true, so this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n- **4. Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n- **5. Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle.**\n- **6. Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n\nThese statements are consistent with the given information and deductions.",

Every rath chortled at Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 1:** \"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\"\n  - We know from the given information that Rafin did chortle at Bungo. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 2:** \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\"\n  - We know a rath snicker-snacked Zindle, but we don't have information that every rath did so. However, it is true that Rafin did chortle at Bungo, so \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is true. The statement is partially true, but since we don't know if every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, the entire statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n- **Statement 3:** \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\"\n  - We know Rafin did chortle at Bungo, so this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 4:** \"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\"\n  - We know a rath snicker-snacked Zindle, and it is true that Rafin did chortle at Bungo, so \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is true. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n- **Statement 5:** \"If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath chortled at Rafin.\"\n  - We have no information about Zindle chortling at Rafin, nor about raths snicker-snacking Bungo or chortling at Rafin. This statement involves conditions that are not supported by the given information, so it cannot be determined to be true.\n\n- **Statement 6:** \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Bungo just in case no raths chortled at Rafin.\"\n  - We know every rath chortled at Zindle, but we have no information about raths chortling at Rafin or Zindle snicker-snacking Bungo.

A borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if every tove chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **Every tove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given information that no toves galumphed over a rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **There is not a rath that every tove galumphed over.**\n   - Since no toves galumphed over a rath, it follows that there is not a single rath that every tove galumphed over. This statement must be true.\n\n3. **Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - This is a logical paradox. If every borogove is mimsy, then all borogoves are mimsy, which contradicts \"not all borogoves are mimsy.\" Conversely, if not all borogoves are mimsy, then not every borogove is mimsy. This statement is always false due to its self-contradictory nature.\n\n4. **A tove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given information that no toves galumphed over a rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Every tove galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This statement also contradicts the given information that no toves galumphed over a rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **A tove galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given information that no toves galumphed over a rath.

Rafin could be a tove or a borogove, and we have no information about whether toves or borogoves are beamish. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n   **4. Rafin isn't a rath.**",

This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 2:** Bungo chortled at Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n  - This is directly given in the problem: Bungo chortled at Zindle, and a rath galumphed over Zindle. This statement is true.\n\n- **Statement 3:** A rath galumphed over Bungo only if a rath chortled at Zindle.\n  - We have no information about a rath chortling at Zindle, so we cannot confirm this statement. It is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 4:** Bungo chortled at Bungo and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n  - We know a rath galumphed over Zindle, but there's no information about Bungo chortling at Bungo. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 5:** If Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n  - This is a complex conditional statement. We have no information about Zindle galumphing over Bungo or raths chortling at Bungo.

Zindle could be a tove or a borogove, but not necessarily a rath. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - We know a borogove will burble, but we don't know if Zindle is a borogove.

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked**:\n   - Since no toves snicker-snacked a rath, it follows that no rath can snicker-snack a tove. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Every tove snicker-snacked every rath**:\n   - This is similar to statement 2 and contradicts the given condition.

If a rath \\( R \\) snicker-snacked a tove \\( T \\), then \\( T \\) must also snicker-snack \\( R \\).\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"Every tove chortled at Bungo only if not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n  - This is a conditional statement. If every tove chortled at Bungo, then it must be true that not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin. Conversely, if all raths snicker-snacked Rafin, then it is possible that no tove chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **No toves snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This contradicts Statement 3, which requires at least some toves to snicker-snack raths (those that are snicker-snacked by raths).\n\n2. **A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This is consistent with Statement 3, as it requires at least some toves to snicker-snack raths.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Statement 3 does not require every tove to snicker-snack every rath, only that each rath snicker-snacks a tove that snicker-snacks it.\n\n4. **No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This is possible, as Statement 3 does not require any tove to snicker-snack all raths.\n\n5. **Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This is consistent with Statement 3, as it requires each rath to be snicker-snacked by a tove, implying that every tove could potentially snicker-snack at least one rath.\n\n6. **A tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Statement 3 does not require any tove to snicker-snack all raths.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **2.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to analyze the given statements and conditions carefully. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and there is at least one of each.\n\n2. **Chortling Relationships**:\n   - A borogove chortled at a rath.\n   - A rath chortled at a rath.\n   - Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n   - No toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n3. **Galumphing and Burbling Conditions**:\n   - No toves galumphed over Zindle unless every tove will burble.\n   - Bungo isn't a borogove only if every tove chortled at Bungo.\n   - If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- **Bungo's Identity**: Bungo isn't a borogove only if every tove chortled at Bungo. This implies that if Bungo is a borogove, it doesn't necessarily mean every tove chortled at Bungo. Conversely, if Bungo isn't a borogove, then every tove must have chortled at Bungo.\n\n- **Toves and Bungo**: No toves chortled at Bungo. This means Bungo cannot be a tove because a tove cannot chortle at itself. Therefore, Bungo must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n- **Bungo as a Borogove**: If Bungo is a borogove, then the condition \"Bungo isn't a borogove only if every tove chortled at Bungo\" is trivially satisfied because the \"only if\" part doesn't apply. Thus, Bungo can be a borogove without any contradiction.\n\n- **Bungo as a Rath**: If Bungo is a rath, then the condition \"Bungo isn't a borogove only if every tove chortled at Bungo\" implies that every tove must have chortled at Bungo. However, we know no toves chortled at Bungo, so Bungo cannot be a rath.\n\nThus, Bungo must be a borogove.\n\n- **Toves and Borogoves**: Since Bungo is a borogove and no toves chortled at Bungo, it follows that not every tove chortled at every borogove. Therefore, statement 2 is false.\n\n- **Existence of Chortling**: Since a borogove chortled at a rath, and a rath chortled at a rath, there is at least one instance of chortling between these entities. However, no toves chortled at Bungo, a borogove, which means not all toves chortled at every borogove.\n\n- **Conclusion on Statements**:\n  - Statement 1: \"No toves chortled at every borogove.\" This must be true because no toves chortled at Bungo, a borogove.\n  - Statement 2: \"Every tove chortled at every borogove.\" This is false as shown above.\n  - Statement 3: \"A tove chortled at every borogove.\" This cannot be determined as true because no toves chortled at Bungo.\n  - Statement 4: \"Every tove chortled at a borogove.\" This cannot be determined as true because no toves chortled at Bungo.\n  - Statement 5: \"A tove chortled at a borogove.\" This cannot be determined as true because no toves chortled at Bungo.\n  - Statement 6: \"No toves chortled at a borogove.\" This is false because it contradicts the possibility that some toves might chortle at other borogoves besides Bungo.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true is:\n\n1. No toves chortled at every borogove.",

This directly contradicts statements 1, 2, 4, and 6.\n   - Statement 3 (\"No borogoves are uffish\") cannot be true because we know a rath is uffish, and there is no information suggesting that borogoves cannot be uffish at all.\n   - Statement 5 (\"Not all borogoves are uffish\") must be true because Rafin is a borogove and is not uffish, which means there exists at least one borogove that is not uffish.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only statement that must be true given the information is statement 5: \"Not all borogoves are uffish.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n5.

Everything is a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n3. Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n4. A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n5. No borogoves are mimsy only if Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 2, we know that every rath snicker-snacked Zindle. This means that statement 2 (\"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle\") is true.\n- From point 3, every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle, but this doesn't directly affect the statements about raths and Zindle.\n- Point 4 states that a rath galumphed over Zindle, but this doesn't directly affect the snicker-snacking relationship.\n- Point 5 introduces a conditional statement about borogoves and mimsiness, but it doesn't directly affect the snicker-snacking relationship between raths and Zindle.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Zindle snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - There is no information given about Zindle snicker-snacking anything, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n2. **A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This is directly given in the problem statement (point 2), so this statement is true.\n\n3. **Not all raths snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts point 2, which states that every rath snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - There is no information given about Zindle snicker-snacking anything, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n5. **No raths snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts point 2, which states that every rath snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - The first part (\"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\") is trivially true because Zindle cannot snicker-snack itself. The second part (\"a rath snicker-snacked Zindle\") is true based on point 2. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 2: A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n- Statement 6: Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nThus, the final answer is that statements 2 and 6 must be true.",

This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n- **Statement 6** is a conditional statement: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin only if not all toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n\n  - The inner part \"Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin only if not all toves chortled at Bungo\" can be rewritten as \"If Zindle chortled at Rafin, then not all toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n  - The entire statement can be rewritten as: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then if Zindle chortled at Rafin, not all toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n\n  Since we know from Statement 5 that no toves chortled at Bungo, it follows that \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true (in fact, \"no toves chortled at Bungo\" is true).\n\n- The condition \"If not all borogoves are mimsy\" is irrelevant to our conclusion because the consequent (\"not all toves chortled at Bungo\") is already true regardless of whether not all borogoves are mimsy.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Bungo chortled at every tove.**\n   - We have no information about Bungo chortling at toves, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n2. **A tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is false because no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n3. **Bungo chortled at a tove.**\n   - We have no information about Bungo chortling at toves, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n4. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is true because no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n5. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - The first part is true, but we have no information about Bungo chortling at Bungo, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n6. **Every tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is false because no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n4. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**",

Zindle isn't beamish.\n8. It is not the case that Rafin gyred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 4**: Only borogoves gyred. This means that if something gyred, it must be a borogove.\n\n- **Statement 8**: It is not the case that Rafin gyred. Therefore, Rafin cannot be a borogove.\n\n- **Statement 7**: Zindle isn't beamish. This doesn't directly affect gyred status but is relevant for other deductions.\n\n- **Statement 3**: Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo. Since every tove chortled at Bungo (Statement 2), Bungo cannot be a tove.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Not all toves chortled at Rafin only if not all toves are beamish. This is a conditional statement. If all toves chortled at Rafin, then all toves must be beamish. If not all toves chortled at Rafin, then it doesn't matter whether all toves are beamish or not.\n\n- **Statement 6**: If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin is beamish. This is another conditional statement.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n1. **Bungo isn't a tove** (from Statement 3 and 2). Therefore, Bungo must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n2. **Rafin isn't a borogove** (from Statement 8 and 4). Therefore, Rafin must be either a tove or a rath.\n\n3. **Zindle isn't beamish** (from Statement 7). This doesn't directly affect gyred status but is relevant for other deductions.\n\n4. **If Bungo is a rath**, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo. According to Statement 6, if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin is beamish. Since we don't have information about Rafin being beamish, we cannot conclude anything definitive about Bungo being a rath.\n\n5. **If Bungo is a borogove**, then Bungo gyred (from Statement 4).\n\n6. **Zindle gyred only if Zindle is a borogove** (from Statement 4).\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle and Bungo gyred**: We cannot conclude this because we don't know if Zindle is a borogove.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin gyred**: We cannot conclude this because Rafin isn't a borogove, and we don't know if Zindle is a borogove.\n\n3. **Bungo isn't a tove**: This must be true based on our deductions.\n\n4. **Bungo is a tove**: This is false based on our deductions.\n\n5. **Zindle didn't gyre**: We cannot conclude this because we don't know if Zindle is a borogove.\n\n6. **Zindle gyred**: We cannot conclude this because we don't know if Zindle is a borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n3. **Bungo isn't a tove.**",

Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n\n2. **Raths**: No raths snicker-snacked Rafin. If every rath is mimsy, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n3. **Borogoves**: A borogove is uffish. Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle.\n\n4. **Toves**: No toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n5. **Zindle**: Zindle is uffish.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- Since Zindle is uffish and a borogove is uffish, Zindle could be a borogove. However, Zindle could also be a tove or a rath, but we know Zindle is uffish, which aligns with being a borogove.\n\n- No toves galumphed over Bungo. This is a direct statement.\n\n- Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle, which means Rafin is not a tove (since toves could galumph over Zindle if they weren't restricted).\n\n- If every rath is mimsy, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo. Since no toves galumphed over Bungo, this condition is satisfied regardless of whether Zindle galumphed over Bungo or not.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy**: We don't have enough information to conclude that Zindle or Bungo are mimsy. Zindle being uffish doesn't imply mimsy.\n\n2. **No toves galumphed over Bungo and every borogove is uffish**: This is true. We know no toves galumphed over Bungo, and every borogove is uffish.\n\n3. **A borogove is uffish and no toves galumphed over Bungo**: This is true. Both parts of the statement are given as facts.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't mimsy**: We don't have enough information to conclude this. Zindle being uffish doesn't imply not being mimsy.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are mimsy**: We don't have enough information to conclude this. There's no direct information about Rafin or Zindle being mimsy.\n\n6. **Zindle is mimsy**: We don't have enough information to conclude this.

It doesn't directly relate to Bungo or the raths' actions towards Bungo.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"A borogove chortled at Bungo just in case Rafin chortled at Bungo.\" This is a biconditional statement about chortling, not snicker-snacking, so it doesn't directly affect statements 2, 3, 5, or 6.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"If Rafin is a tove, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" This is another conditional statement about chortling, not snicker-snacking, so it doesn't directly affect statements 2, 3, 5, or 6.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Statement 1**: \"Not all raths snicker-snacked Bungo.\" This must be true because statement 2 (\"No raths snicker-snacked Bungo\") is true, which implies that not all raths could have snicker-snacked Bungo (since none did).\n\n- **Statement 2**: \"A rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\" This is false due to statement 2 (\"No raths snicker-snacked Bungo\").\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Bungo snicker-snacked a rath.\" There is no information given about Bungo snicker-snacking anyone, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Zindle is a tove.\" There is no information given that directly determines Zindle's type.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"Bungo snicker-snacked every rath.\" There is no information given about Bungo snicker-snacking anyone, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\" This is false due to statement 2 (\"No raths snicker-snacked Bungo\").\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n\n1. Not all raths snicker-snacked Bungo.",

For each borogove \\( B \\), there exists a rath \\( R \\) such that \\( B \\) galumphed over \\( R \\) and \\( R \\) galumphed over \\( B \\).\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This is a complex conditional statement. However, the key part is the implication that involves the behavior of toves and borogoves. The statement is somewhat convoluted, but it suggests a dependency on the mimsiness of borogoves and the galumphing behavior of toves.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Not all borogoves will whiffle and Bungo isn't mimsy.\" This tells us that there is at least one borogove that does not whiffle, and Bungo, which is a rath, is not mimsy.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **No borogoves galumphed over every rath.**\n   - Given that every borogove galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it, it doesn't necessarily mean a borogove galumphed over every rath. This statement could be true, but it doesn't have to be true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Every borogove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that each borogove galumphed over a specific rath that galumphed over it. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **A borogove galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This must be true because every borogove galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it.\n\n4. **There is a borogove that every rath galumphed over.**\n   - The given information does not support this. It only states that each borogove galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it, not that a single borogove was galumphed over by every rath.\n\n5. **A borogove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, this is not supported by the given information. Each borogove galumphed over a specific rath, not all raths.\n\n6. **No borogoves galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given information that every borogove galumphed over a rath.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n3. **A borogove galumphed over a rath.**",

Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n6. A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n7. A rath chortled at Zindle only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"A rath chortled at Zindle only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n\n  This is a conditional statement: If a rath chortled at Zindle, then Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin. We know from statement 4 that a rath did chortle at Zindle. Therefore, by modus ponens, Rafin must have snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\n  This doesn't directly affect the other statements but confirms that raths are involved in snicker-snacking.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **Zindle isn't a tove.**\n\n   - We know every rath chortled at Zindle. If Zindle were a tove, it would contradict the statement that no toves chortled at Rafin, as chortling is a behavior of raths. However, this doesn't directly prove Zindle isn't a tove, only that Zindle being a tove would create a contradiction if Zindle chortled at Rafin. Since Zindle is chortled at by raths, Zindle could still be a tove without contradiction. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n\n   - We have already deduced that Rafin must have snicker-snacked Rafin because a rath chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Rafin is a tove.**\n\n   - There is no information that directly links Rafin to being a tove. Rafin could be any of the three: tove, borogove, or rath. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n\n   - As deduced from the conditional statement, since a rath chortled at Zindle, Rafin must have snicker-snacked Rafin. This statement is true.\n\n5. **Zindle is a tove.**\n\n   - Similar to statement 1, there is no direct evidence or necessity that Zindle is a tove. Zindle could be any of the three. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Rafin isn't a tove.**\n\n   - There is no information that directly states Rafin isn't a tove. Rafin could be any of the three.

It means:\n    - If Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo, then not all toves gyred.\n    - If not all toves gyred, then Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\"\n  - From Statement 2, since Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo, it follows that not all toves gyred.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"Every rath gyred.\"\n  - This means all raths gyred.\n\n- **Statement 4**: \"Zindle gyred.\"\n  - This is given directly.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- Since not all toves gyred (from Rafin not chortling at Bungo), there is at least one tove that did not gyre.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"A borogove chortled at Rafin.\"\n  - This is given directly.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n   - We know Zindle gyred, but we have no information about Bungo gyred. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Zindle gyred. This statement is false.\n\n3. **Rafin gyred.**\n   - We have no information about Rafin gyred. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred.**\n   - Both parts of this statement are given as true. This statement is true.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Zindle gyred.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Zindle gyred. This statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n   - We know Zindle gyred, but we have no information about Rafin gyred. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n4. A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred.",

It means Bungo must be a borogove because the only way for the statement to be true is if Bungo is indeed a borogove.\n\n- **Statement 6**: \"A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\" Since Bungo is a borogove, Bungo cannot be a tove. Therefore, Bungo cannot snicker-snack itself, so the statement \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo\" is false, which is consistent because Bungo cannot snicker-snack itself.\n\n- **Statement 5**: \"A rath chortled at every borogove.\" Since Bungo is a borogove, a rath must have chortled at Bungo.\n\n- **Statement 3**: \"Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case a borogove chortled at Bungo.\" Since a rath (which is not a borogove) chortled at Bungo, a borogove did not chortle at Bungo. Therefore, Zindle must have chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A rath chortled at Bungo.**  \n   - True, because a rath chortled at every borogove, and Bungo is a borogove.\n\n2. **No raths chortled at Bungo.**  \n   - False, because a rath chortled at every borogove, including Bungo.\n\n3. **Bungo chortled at every rath.**  \n   - There is no information to support this. Bungo is a borogove, and borogoves chortle at raths, not the other way around.\n\n4. **Bungo chortled at a rath.**  \n   - False, because borogoves chortle at raths, not the other way around.\n\n5. **Not all raths chortled at Bungo.**  \n   - False, because all raths chortled at every borogove, including Bungo.\n\n6. **Every rath chortled at Bungo.**  \n   - True, because a rath chortled at every borogove, and Bungo is a borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n1.

Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and there is at least one of each.\n\n2. **Galumphing Relationship**: Every borogove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it. This implies a chain: if \\( B \\) is a borogove and \\( T \\) is a tove, then \\( B \\) galumphed over \\( T \\), and \\( T \\) galumphed over \\( B \\).\n\n3. **Uffish Borogoves**: A borogove is uffish.\n\n4. **Rafin and Zindle**: Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle.\n\n5. **Zindle and Bungo**: If Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n\n   - From the condition that every borogove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it, it follows that for each borogove \\( B \\), there exists a tove \\( T \\) such that \\( T \\) galumphed over \\( B \\). This implies that every tove must have galumphed over at least one borogove. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n2. **A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n\n   - The condition only guarantees that each borogove has a tove that galumphed over it, not that a single tove galumphed over all borogoves. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n\n   - Similar to statement 2, there is no information to suggest that every tove galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No toves galumphed over a borogove.**\n\n   - This directly contradicts the condition that every borogove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n\n   - As established in statement 1, every borogove has a tove that galumphed over it. Therefore, at least one tove galumphed over at least one borogove. This statement is true.\n\n6. **No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n\n   - There is no information to suggest that any tove galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n\n1. Every tove galumphed over a borogove.\n5. A tove galumphed over a borogove.\n6.

This implies a mutual galumphing relationship between some toves and borogoves. Therefore, there must be at least one tove and one borogove such that the tove galumphed over the borogove, and the borogove galumphed over the tove.\n\n- **Statement 3**: Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin unless only toves gyred. Since every rath gyred (Statement 7), and not only toves gyred, Zindle did not chortle at Rafin.\n\n- **Statement 4**: If every rath galumphed over Rafin, then every rath chortled at Rafin. We don't have information confirming that every rath galumphed over Rafin, so we cannot conclude that every rath chortled at Rafin.\n\n- **Statement 5**: A borogove chortled at Rafin. This is given directly.\n\n- **Statement 6**: Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. This implies at least one tove did not snicker-snack Zindle.\n\n- **Statement 8**: A rath galumphed over Zindle. This is given directly.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **A tove galumphed over a borogove**: From Statement 2, we know that every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it. Therefore, there must be at least one tove that galumphed over a borogove. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **No toves galumphed over a borogove**: This contradicts Statement 2, which requires every tove to galumph over a borogove. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **A tove galumphed over every borogove**: Statement 2 only guarantees that each tove galumphed over at least one borogove that galumphed over it, not every borogove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over**: Statement 2 does not imply that there is a single tove that every borogove galumphed over. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove**: Statement 2 only ensures mutual galumphing between some toves and borogoves, not that every tove galumphed over every borogove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No toves galumphed over every borogove**: Since Statement 2 does not require any tove to galumph over every borogove, this statement could be true. However, it is not necessarily true because it is possible (though not required) for a tove to galumph over every borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. **A tove galumphed over a borogove.**",

This directly tells us that not all toves are uffish because Rafin is a tove and not uffish.\n\n- **Zindle is uffish**. We don't know Zindle's type (tove, borogove, or rath), but Zindle being uffish doesn't affect the tove's status directly.\n\n- **Rafin chortled at Zindle**: This is a fact but doesn't directly affect the logical deductions about toves and uffish.\n\n- **Conditional Statement**: \"Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin only if Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.\" This is a bit tricky, but let's break it down:\n  - \"Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin\" is false because it's not possible for Rafin to chortle at himself in this context (assuming chortling at oneself is not allowed or doesn't make sense).\n  - Therefore, the conditional statement is vacuously true because the \"only if\" part doesn't need to be checked when the \"if\" part is false.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Every tove is uffish**: False, because Rafin is a tove and not uffish.\n\n2. **Every tove is uffish or no toves are uffish**: This is a logical disjunction. Since not every tove is uffish (Rafin is a tove and not uffish), the second part \"no toves are uffish\" must be considered. However, we know Zindle is uffish, and Zindle could be a tove, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A tove is uffish**: This could be true if Zindle is a tove, but we don't have enough information to confirm this.\n\n4. **Not all toves are uffish**: True, because Rafin is a tove and not uffish.\n\n5. **No toves are uffish**: False, because if Zindle is a tove, then at least one tove is uffish.\n\n6. **Only toves are uffish**: This would mean that if something is uffish, it must be a tove. We don't have enough information to confirm this, as Zindle could be a borogove or a rath.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement that must be true is:\n\n4. **Not all toves are uffish.**",

This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n1. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**  \n   - This would mean every borogove was snicker-snacked by at least one tove. However, we only know that there is one specific borogove that every tove snicker-snacked. We don't have information about other borogoves. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**  \n   - Since there is a borogove that every tove snicker-snacked, it follows that at least one tove snicker-snacked a borogove. This statement must be true.\n\n3. **There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.**  \n   - We know every tove snicker-snacked a particular borogove, but we have no information about any tove being snicker-snacked by all borogoves. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**  \n   - This is the negation of statement 1. Since statement 1 is not necessarily true, this statement could be true, but it is not definitively true based on the given information.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**  \n   - This contradicts statement 2, which we determined must be true.

Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Entities**: Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n\n2. **Rath Chortled at Bungo**: A rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n3. **Borogove Characteristics**: A borogove is uffish and only borogoves gyred.\n\n4. **Rafin Chortled at Zindle**: Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n\n5. **Raths Chortled at Zindle**: Every rath chortled at Zindle.\n\n6. **Tove Characteristics**: Every tove is uffish unless Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle.\n\n7. **Bungo's Actions**: Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n8. **Rafin's Characteristics**: Rafin isn't uffish.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- **Rafin's Identity**: Since Rafin isn't uffish, Rafin cannot be a borogove (because borogoves are uffish) and cannot be a tove (because toves are uffish unless Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle). Therefore, Rafin must be a rath.\n\n- **Raths Chortled at Zindle**: Since every rath chortled at Zindle and Rafin is a rath, Rafin chortled at Zindle, which is consistent with the given information.\n\n- **Bungo's Chortling**: We need to determine if Bungo chortled at Zindle. If Bungo chortled at Zindle, then every tove is uffish. If Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle, then not every tove is uffish.\n\n- **Zindle's Identity**: Since every rath chortled at Zindle and Rafin (a rath) chortled at Zindle, Zindle cannot be a rath (as a rath cannot chortle at itself).\n\n- **Zindle's Actions**: We need to determine if Zindle gyred. Only borogoves gyred, so if Zindle gyred, Zindle must be a borogove.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **No raths chortled at Zindle**: This is false because every rath chortled at Zindle.\n\n2. **A rath chortled at Zindle**: This is true because every rath chortled at Zindle, and Rafin, a rath, chortled at Zindle.\n\n3. **Zindle chortled at a rath**: There is no information to support this statement.\n\n4. **Not all raths chortled at Zindle**: This is false because every rath chortled at Zindle.\n\n5. **Zindle gyred**: If Zindle gyred, Zindle must be a borogove. There is no contradiction in this, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Zindle chortled at every rath**: There is no information to support this statement.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n2. A rath chortled at Zindle.",

This statement doesn't provide information about borogoves being beamish, so we can't conclude this must be true.\n\n2. **Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - Only toves are mimsy, so no borogove can be mimsy. Therefore, \"every borogove is mimsy\" is false, and \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" is true. The statement \"just in case\" means both sides must have the same truth value, which they don't. So, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - This is identical to statement 2 and is false for the same reasons.\n\n4. **A borogove is uffish but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Every borogove is uffish, so the first part is true.\n   - Bungo chortled at Bungo if and only if no borogoves are beamish. We don't have information about borogoves being beamish, so we can't conclude this must be true.\n\n5. **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and every borogove is uffish.**\n   - Every borogove is uffish, so the second part is true.\n   - Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo if and only if some borogoves are beamish.

We don't have information about borogoves being beamish, so we can't conclude this must be true.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the statements must be true based on the information provided. However, statement 1 is partially true because every borogove is uffish, but we can't definitively say Bungo chortled at Bungo without more information about borogoves being beamish.\n\nThus, the final answer is that none of the statements must be true in this situation.",

It is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n5. Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n6. It is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish (i.e., Rafin is beamish).\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n\n1. **Not all raths gimbled just in case Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know every rath gimbled. Therefore, \"not all raths gimbled\" is false. For the statement to be true, \"Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo\" must also be false, meaning Zindle did chortle at Bungo. However, we have no information about Zindle chortling at Bungo, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **If a rath chortled at Zindle, then Bungo gimbled.**\n   - We know every rath gimbled, but there's no information about raths chortling or Bungo gimbled. This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We know every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Zindle.

This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case a rath gimbled.**\n   - \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" We know every rath gimbled, so \"a rath gimbled\" is always true. For the statement to be true, \"Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo\" must also always be true, which we cannot confirm. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Every rath gimbled but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We know every rath gimbled, but Bungo chortled at Zindle, so this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n3. **Every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Zindle.**",
