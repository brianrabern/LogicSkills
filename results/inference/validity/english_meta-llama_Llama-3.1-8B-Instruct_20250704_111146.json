Every human chased a donkey.\n4. A monkey kicked Alfred, but it is not the case that Lewis is happy.\n5. If a monkey chased Hazel, then not all humans kicked Hazel.\n6. If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that a monkey kicked Alfred, and it is not the case that Lewis is happy. This implies that the monkey that kicked Alfred is not Lewis.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that every human chased a donkey. This means that if a human kicked Hazel, it must be a donkey that kicked Hazel, because if a human kicked Hazel, then all humans would have kicked Hazel, which contradicts statement 5.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 6. If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel. If a monkey kicked Hazel, then all donkeys must have kicked Hazel, which contradicts statement 5. Therefore, if a monkey kicked Hazel, then Alfred must attack.\n\nFrom statement 5, if a monkey chased Hazel, then not all humans kicked Hazel. This means that if a monkey kicked Hazel, then not all humans kicked Hazel. Since we know that a monkey kicked Alfred, and it is not the case that Lewis is happy, the monkey that kicked Alfred must have kicked Hazel.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 1. If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel. Since we know that a monkey kicked Hazel, Alfred must attack.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 3. If Alfred will attack, then all donkeys must have kicked Hazel, which contradicts statement 5. Therefore, Alfred will not attack.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. If Alfred is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred, then it is not the case that Lewis is happy. This is already given in statement 4. However, we also know that a monkey kicked Alfred, and it is not the case that Lewis is happy. This implies that the monkey that kicked Alfred is not Lewis. Therefore, Alfred is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 4. If Alfred and Lewis will attack, then all donkeys must have kicked Hazel, which contradicts statement 5. Therefore, Alfred and Lewis will not attack.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 5. A monkey is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred. We know that a monkey kicked Alfred, and it is not the case that Lewis is happy. This implies that the monkey that kicked Alfred is not Lewis. Therefore, a monkey is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 6. If Alfred and Hazel will attack, then all donkeys must have kicked Hazel, which contradicts statement 5. Therefore, Alfred and Hazel will not attack.\n\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n\n1. Alfred won't attack.\n2. Alfred is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n3. A monkey is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\nThe final answer is: 1, 2, 5.",

This implies that Alfred is not a monkey, because if Alfred were a monkey, he would have chased Lewis (since every monkey chased Lewis), and then he would have chased himself, which contradicts the given information.\n3. Since Alfred is a donkey, and not a monkey, we can conclude that there is at least one monkey, because we are told there is at least one of each.\n4. If every monkey chased Lewis, then Hazel will attack. This implies that Hazel is not a monkey, because if Hazel were a monkey, she would have chased Lewis, and then she would have attacked herself, which is not possible.\n5. Since Hazel is not a monkey, she must be either a donkey or a human. If Hazel were a human, then she would not attack anyone, because there is no information that suggests humans attack each other. Therefore, Hazel must be a donkey.\n6. Since Hazel is a donkey, and Alfred is a donkey, and there is at least one monkey, we can conclude that there are at least two donkeys.\n7. If every monkey chased Lewis, then Hazel will attack. This implies that Hazel is not a monkey, and therefore, she is a donkey.

Since there are at least two donkeys, and Alfred is a donkey, it is possible that Alfred chased one of the other donkeys, but it is not necessary. However, we can conclude that Alfred did not chase every donkey, because there is at least one other donkey (Hazel).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1.

So, we can't conclude anything from this statement.\n\nFrom statement 6, we know that every monkey chased Hazel. However, this contradicts statement 1, which says Hazel is a monkey.

However, we don't know if every monkey is hungry or not. But we do know that Hazel is a monkey. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel would have chased itself, which is not possible. So, every monkey cannot have chased Hazel.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that if Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if no humans are hungry. We know that Hazel didn't chase Hazel (from statement 1), so a human must have chased Hazel. We also know that a human will run (from statement 2). If a human chased Hazel, then it must be because no humans are hungry (from statement 4). \n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If every monkey is hungry, then Alfred will run (from statement 3).

This is a contradiction, so this possibility is not possible.\n\n- If some monkeys are hungry and some are not, then Alfred will run (from statement 3). But we know that a human will run (from statement 2), so Alfred can't run. This is a contradiction, so this possibility is not possible.\n\n- If no monkeys are hungry, then Alfred won't run (from statement 3). But we know that a human will run (from statement 2), so Alfred must run. This is a contradiction, so this possibility is not possible.\n\nHowever, we know that a human chased Hazel (from statement 4), and a human will run (from statement 2). If a human chased Hazel, then it must be because no humans are hungry (from statement 4). We also know that not all monkeys are hungry (from the above analysis). \n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If a human chased Hazel, then a monkey must have chased Hazel (because Hazel is a monkey). \n\n- If a monkey chased Hazel, then it must be because every monkey is hungry (from statement 3).

This means that if there's a monkey, it didn't see any donkey.\n3. Not all donkeys saw Hazel. This implies that at least one donkey didn't see Hazel.\n4. If Alfred ate, then every monkey chased Hazel only if no donkeys ate. This statement is a conditional statement, so we need to consider two cases: when Alfred ate and when Alfred didn't eat.\n\nLet's consider the case when Alfred ate. In this case, every monkey chased Hazel only if no donkeys ate. This means that if there are donkeys that ate, then every monkey didn't chase Hazel.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when Alfred didn't eat. In this case, the statement doesn't provide any information about the behavior of monkeys.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that at least one donkey didn't see Hazel. Let's call this donkey D1. If D1 is the only donkey, then all other donkeys saw Hazel, but this contradicts statement 3. Therefore, there must be at least two donkeys, D1 and D2.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when Alfred ate. If D1 ate, then every monkey didn't chase Hazel, but this contradicts the fact that there's at least one monkey. Therefore, D1 didn't eat.\n\nIf D2 ate, then every monkey chased Hazel, but this contradicts the fact that there's at least one monkey that didn't chase Hazel. Therefore, D2 didn't eat.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when Alfred didn't eat. In this case, we don't have any information about the behavior of monkeys.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that:\n\n- If Alfred ate, then every monkey didn't chase Hazel, and D1 didn't eat.\n- If Alfred didn't eat, then we don't have any information about the behavior of monkeys.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1.

Every donkey kicked every monkey that kicked every monkey. \n   - This implies that if a monkey kicked a monkey, then all donkeys kicked that monkey.\n\n2. Every monkey will run or Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n   - This statement doesn't provide any direct information about the actions of donkeys or humans, but it implies that if a monkey runs, then Alfred won't see Lewis.\n\n3. A monkey kicked Hazel unless every donkey chased Alfred.\n   - This statement implies that if every donkey chased Alfred, then no monkey kicked Hazel. However, it also implies that if a monkey kicked Hazel, then not every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n4. If every monkey saw Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run.\n   - This statement implies that if every monkey saw Lewis and Lewis runs, then a human didn't chase Hazel.\n\n5. Not all donkeys chased Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n   - This statement implies that at least one donkey didn't chase Alfred and at least one monkey kicked Alfred.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know that at least one monkey kicked Alfred. Let's call this monkey M. \n\nFrom statement 3, we know that if a monkey kicked Hazel, then not every donkey chased Alfred. However, we also know that at least one donkey didn't chase Alfred. This implies that not every donkey chased Alfred, so a monkey kicked Hazel.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- If every monkey saw Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run (statement 4). However, this doesn't provide any information about whether a monkey kicked Hazel or not.\n\n- If a monkey kicked Hazel, then not every donkey chased Alfred (statement 3). This is consistent with our previous conclusion that a monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n- If every monkey kicked every monkey that kicked every monkey (statement 1), then all donkeys kicked M (the monkey that kicked Alfred). However, this would imply that every donkey chased Alfred, which contradicts our previous conclusion that not every donkey chased Alfred.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that a monkey kicked Hazel.\n\nThe final answer is: 3.

This means that if there are multiple monkeys, they all chased each other.\n\n2. A monkey will attack or not all monkeys saw Hazel. This statement is not relevant to the other statements, but it tells us that there is at least one monkey that did not see Hazel.\n\n3. Since there is at least one monkey that did not see Hazel, and every monkey chased every monkey, there must be at least two monkeys. If there was only one monkey, it would have seen Hazel.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the possible scenarios for the monkeys:\n   - If there are two monkeys, then one of them must have been chased by the other. This means statement 1 is false.\n   - If there are three or more monkeys, then every monkey must have been chased by at least one other monkey. This means statement 1 is false.\n\n5. In both scenarios, statement 1 is false. Therefore, statement 1 is false.\n\n6. Since Alfred kicked Lewis, and there is at least one monkey, Alfred must be a human or a donkey. If Alfred was a monkey, he would have chased every monkey, which is not the case.\n\n7. Now, let's consider the possible scenarios for Alfred:\n   - If Alfred is a human, then he did not chase any monkey. This means statement 2 is true.\n   - If Alfred is a donkey, then he must have chased a monkey. This means statement 2 is false.\n\n8. Since Alfred is either a human or a donkey, and statement 2 is true in one of the scenarios, statement 2 is true.\n\n9. Since there is at least one monkey, and every monkey chased every monkey, there is a monkey that every monkey chased. This means statement 3 is false.\n\n10. Since there is a monkey that every monkey chased, it means that not all monkeys chased every monkey. This means statement 4 is true.\n\n11. Since there is a monkey that every monkey chased, it means that there is a monkey that was not chased by every monkey. This means statement 5 is false.\n\n12. Since Alfred is either a human or a donkey, and he kicked Lewis, it means that Alfred will attack. This means statement 6 is true.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 2: No monkeys chased a monkey.\n- Statement 4: No monkeys chased every monkey.\n- Statement 6: Alfred will attack.",

This implies that if a donkey kicked Lewis, there must be a human who chased Hazel. Since no humans will attack, the human who chased Hazel must be a monkey. This is because if the human who chased Hazel were a human, it would be attacking, which is not allowed.\n\n3.  Since a monkey chased Hazel, and there's at least one monkey, the monkey who chased Hazel must be one of the three individuals (donkey, human, or monkey). However, we already established that Alfred is a human or a monkey. Therefore, the monkey who chased Hazel must be the monkey, and Alfred must be the human.\n\n4.  Now, let's consider the statement \"Alfred saw a donkey.\" If Alfred saw a donkey, then that donkey must be one of the three individuals (donkey, human, or monkey).

No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. Hazel will attack only if a donkey kicked Hazel.\n5. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel. This means that if Hazel is going to attack, it must be because a monkey kicked Hazel.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that Hazel will attack only if a donkey kicked Hazel. However, we already know that no donkeys kicked Hazel. Therefore, Hazel will not attack.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 5: If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel. This statement is a conditional statement. If the condition is true (Hazel is hungry), then the consequence is true (not all donkeys kicked Alfred). However, we don't know if Hazel is hungry or not. But we do know that if Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel. This means that if Hazel is hungry, then either all donkeys kicked Alfred or a monkey kicked Hazel.\n\nSince we already know that no donkeys kicked Hazel, if Hazel is hungry, then a monkey must have kicked Hazel. But we also know that Hazel will not attack because no donkeys kicked Hazel. Therefore, if Hazel is hungry, then a monkey kicked Hazel, but Hazel will not attack.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: Hazel will attack. We already know that Hazel will not attack because no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 1: Alfred won't attack. We don't have any information about Alfred's hunger or whether he was kicked by a donkey or a monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred won't attack.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 4: Alfred will attack. We don't have any information about Alfred's hunger or whether he was kicked by a donkey or a monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will attack.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 5: Alfred and Hazel will attack. We already know that Hazel will not attack.

Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n   - Since Lewis didn't chase Lewis, it's not a donkey (because a donkey would chase another donkey). \n   - This implies that Lewis is a human or a monkey. \n   - If Lewis is a human, then every human saw Alfred, which we already know. \n   - If Lewis is a monkey, then every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n3.

Combining the information from steps 2 and 3, we know that Lewis is a monkey and every monkey saw Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. Alfred is happy: We know that a monkey is happy, but we don't know if Alfred is a monkey or a human. However, since every human saw Alfred, and there's at least one human, Alfred must be a human. Since a human is happy, Alfred is happy. **Statement 1 is true.**\n\n2. A monkey is happy but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel: We know that a monkey is happy and Lewis is a monkey. However, we also know that Lewis doesn't see Hazel. This statement is false because it says \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel,\" which is the opposite of what we know.\n\n3. Alfred and Lewis are happy: We know that Alfred is happy, but we don't know if Lewis is happy. Lewis is a monkey, and we know that a monkey is happy, but we can't conclude that Lewis is happy because we don't know if Lewis is a human or a monkey. This statement is false.\n\n4. A monkey is happy and Lewis doesn't see Hazel: We know that a monkey is happy and Lewis doesn't see Hazel. This statement is true.\n\n5. Hazel is happy if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis: We know that every monkey saw Hazel, so this statement is false.\n\n6.

This statement does not provide any direct information about humans running, but it does imply that a monkey saw Alfred.\n4. Not all humans kicked Alfred if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.

We know that Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if Hazel is a human, but it doesn't mean Alfred is a human.\n4. Lewis isn't a human: This statement is not necessarily true. We know that a human saw Lewis, but it doesn't mean Lewis is not a human.\n5. Alfred is a monkey: This statement is not necessarily true. We know that every monkey chased Alfred, but it doesn't mean Alfred is a monkey.\n6. Alfred isn't a human: This statement is true. If Alfred were a human, then Alfred would see Alfred (since humans see themselves), which contradicts the statement that Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if Hazel is a human. Therefore, Alfred must be a monkey.\n\nThe final answer is: 6. Alfred isn't a human.",

This means that the human who is happy must be the one who chased Alfred.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible identities of the human who is happy and the donkey that kicked the monkey.\n\n- If the human who is happy is Hazel, then Hazel must be a human, and the donkey that kicked the monkey must be a different donkey. In this case, statement 2 (Hazel kicked a donkey) is true.\n\n- If the human who is happy is not Hazel, then Hazel must be a donkey. In this case, statement 3 (A donkey kicked Hazel) is true.\n\nHowever, we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel (statement 2). Therefore, the first scenario is the correct one, and statement 2 (Hazel kicked a donkey) is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the other statements:\n\n- Statement 1 (Hazel kicked every donkey) is not necessarily true, as there could be other donkeys that Hazel did not kick.\n- Statement 3 (A donkey kicked Hazel) is not necessarily true, as we've already established that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- Statement 4 (Every donkey kicked Hazel) is not necessarily true, as there could be donkeys that did not kick Hazel.\n- Statement 5 (Not all donkeys kicked Hazel) is true, as we've already established that no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- Statement 6 (Alfred is happy) is not necessarily true, as we don't have enough information to determine whether Alfred was chased by a donkey or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe statement that must be true is: 2. Hazel kicked a donkey.",

No humans will attack but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n   - This statement tells us that humans will not attack, and Lewis sees Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. No monkeys saw Lewis.\n   - This statement cannot be true because if all monkeys saw Lewis, then Lewis would see Hazel (since Hazel is a monkey), which contradicts the fact that Lewis sees Hazel but is not hungry (as it would imply Lewis is hungry if he saw Hazel).\n\n2. Every monkey saw Lewis.\n   - This statement cannot be true because if every monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis would see Hazel (since Hazel is a monkey), which contradicts the fact that Lewis sees Hazel but is not hungry (as it would imply Lewis is hungry if he saw Hazel).\n\n3. Lewis saw every monkey.\n   - This statement cannot be true because if Lewis saw every monkey, then Lewis would see Hazel (since Hazel is a monkey), which contradicts the fact that Lewis sees Hazel but is not hungry (as it would imply Lewis is hungry if he saw Hazel).\n\n4. A monkey saw Lewis.\n   - This statement must be true because if no monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis would not see Hazel (since Hazel is a monkey), which contradicts the fact that Lewis sees Hazel.\n\n5. Not all monkeys saw Lewis.\n   - This statement must be true because if all monkeys saw Lewis, then Lewis would see Hazel (since Hazel is a monkey), which contradicts the fact that Lewis sees Hazel but is not hungry (as it would imply Lewis is hungry if he saw Hazel).\n\n6. Lewis saw a monkey.\n   - This statement must be true because Lewis sees Hazel, and Hazel is a monkey.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- 4. A monkey saw Lewis.\n- 5. Not all monkeys saw Lewis.\n- 6. Lewis saw a monkey.",

Every donkey kicked a human: This statement is false because it's possible that only one donkey kicked every human, and the other donkeys didn't kick any humans.\n\n4. No donkeys kicked a human: This statement is false because we already know that a donkey kicked every human.\n\n5. There is a human that every human kicked: This statement is true because it's given in the problem statement.\n\n6. Every donkey kicked every human: This statement is false because it's possible that only one donkey kicked every human, and the other donkeys didn't kick any humans.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the condition given in the problem: \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" This condition is a bit tricky, but it can be broken down as follows:\n\n- If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate. This means that if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then either monkeys kicked Hazel or donkeys ate. \n\n- Since we know that a donkey kicked every human, and there's at least one human that every human kicked, it's possible that the human that every human kicked is Hazel. If that's the case, then Alfred must have kicked Hazel because it's given that every human kicked Hazel. \n\n- If Alfred kicked Hazel, then the condition \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate\" is satisfied regardless of whether monkeys kicked Hazel or donkeys ate.\n\n- If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then the condition \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate\" is satisfied if no donkeys ate.\n\nHowever, we know that there's at least one donkey that ate, because a donkey kicked every human. Therefore, the condition \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate\" is not satisfied if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\n\nSo, the only way to satisfy the condition is if Alfred kicked Hazel. \n\nNow, let's go back to the original statements:\n\n1. A donkey kicked a human: This statement is true because we already know that a donkey kicked every human.\n\n2. No donkeys kicked every human: This statement is true because it's possible that only one donkey kicked every human, and the other donkeys didn't kick any humans.\n\n3.

Every donkey kicked every human: This statement is false because it's possible that only one donkey kicked every human, and the other donkeys didn't kick any humans.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that statement 2 is true because it's the only way to satisfy the condition given in the problem.",

This means that if there is a donkey that chased a human, then all other donkeys chased that donkey.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. A donkey chased every human. This is not necessarily true. If there is a donkey that chased a human, then all other donkeys chased that donkey, but it doesn't mean that every human was chased by a donkey.\n2. Every donkey chased a human. This is not necessarily true. If there is a donkey that was not chased by any other donkey, then it may not have chased a human.\n3. A donkey chased a human. This is possible. If there is a donkey that chased a human, then all other donkeys chased that donkey.\n4. No donkeys chased a human. This is not necessarily true. If there is a donkey that chased a human, then all other donkeys chased that donkey.\n5. No donkeys chased every human. This is true. If there is a donkey that chased a human, then all other donkeys chased that donkey, but it doesn't mean that every human was chased by a donkey.\n6. Every donkey chased every human. This is not necessarily true. If there is a donkey that was not chased by any other donkey, then it may not have chased every human.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n5.

No donkeys chased a monkey that chased it.\n3. Every human chased Alfred and only humans ate.\n4. Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that only humans ate. This directly answers statement 1, which says \"Only donkeys ate.\" Since we know that only humans ate, statement 1 is false.\n\nFrom statement 3, we also know that every human chased Alfred. This does not provide any information about Alfred's species, but it does tell us that Alfred was chased by humans.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that not all donkeys chased Alfred, but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel. This statement implies that Hazel is a donkey, because if Hazel were a human, it would be possible for Hazel to chase Hazel, which would make the statement true. However, this would contradict the fact that not all donkeys chased Alfred, since Hazel would be a donkey that chased Alfred. Therefore, Hazel is a donkey.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that no donkeys chased a monkey that chased it. This statement does not provide any information about the species of the donkeys or monkeys, but it does tell us that if a monkey chased a donkey, the donkey did not chase the monkey.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- If a human chased a monkey, the monkey could either be a donkey or a human. If the monkey is a donkey, then the donkey did not chase the human, which is possible. If the monkey is a human, then the human did not chase the human, which is also possible.\n- If a donkey chased a monkey, the monkey could either be a donkey or a human. If the monkey is a donkey, then the donkey did not chase the monkey, which is possible. If the monkey is a human, then the donkey did not chase the human, which is possible.\n\nFrom the above scenarios, we can see that it is possible for a donkey to chase a human, and it is also possible for a human to chase a donkey. This means that statement 5, \"Every donkey ate,\" is false, because not all donkeys chased Alfred, and it is possible for a donkey to chase a human.\n\nStatement 6, \"Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run,\" is a contradictory statement. If every donkey will run, then not all donkeys will run is false, and vice versa. Therefore, statement 6 is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the only statement that must be true is statement 2, \"Alfred ate,\" is not directly supported by the information given, but we can infer that statement 3, \"A donkey ate,\" is true because only humans ate, and there is at least one donkey.",

Alfred will run.\n3. Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel. This implies that if Alfred sees Alfred, it's because Alfred is not a human, or there's no human chasing Hazel. Since there's at least one human, the second part of the condition is always true. Therefore, Alfred must see Alfred, which means Alfred is not a human.\n4. No humans will run. This implies that if Alfred is a human, he won't run, which contradicts the fact that Alfred will run. Therefore, Alfred is not a human.\n\nFrom steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that Alfred is not a human. This directly answers statement 1, which is false, and statement 6, which is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the other statements:\n\n- Statement 2: \"Alfred and Hazel will run.\" We know Alfred will run, but we don't know if Hazel will run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n- Statement 3: \"Alfred won't run.\" We know Alfred will run, so this statement is false.\n- Statement 4: \"Hazel and Alfred will run.\" We know Alfred will run, but we don't know if Hazel will run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n- Statement 5: \"Hazel will run.\" We don't have enough information to determine if Hazel will run or not. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n6. Alfred isn't a human.",

            "raw_response": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Every monkey chased a donkey that chased it. This means that for every monkey, there is a donkey that chased it. Let's call this donkey \"D\" and the monkey \"M\". So, we have a situation where M chased D.\n\n2. A monkey kicked Alfred unless a monkey will attack. This means that if a monkey will attack, then Alfred was not kicked by that monkey. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between donkeys and monkeys.\n\n3. No humans kicked Lewis. This means that either a monkey or a donkey kicked Lewis. Since every monkey chased a donkey that chased it, and there's at least one monkey, there must be at least one donkey that was chased by a monkey. This donkey could have kicked Lewis.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n   a. If a monkey kicked Lewis, then Alfred was not kicked by that monkey (from statement 2). This means that the monkey that kicked Lewis must be the one that chased a donkey that chased it (from statement 1). However, this would mean that the donkey that was chased by the monkey that kicked Lewis is the one that chased the monkey that kicked Lewis. This creates a cycle where a donkey chased a monkey, and the monkey chased a donkey, which is not possible. Therefore, a monkey cannot have kicked Lewis.\n\n   b. If a donkey kicked Lewis, then Alfred was not kicked by any monkey (from statement 2). This means that every monkey must have been chased by a donkey, and the donkey that kicked Lewis must be the one that chased every monkey.\n\n5. From the above analysis, we can conclude that a donkey must have kicked Lewis, and this donkey must have chased every monkey. This means that every monkey was chased by a donkey, and a donkey chased a monkey (from statement 1).\n\n6. Since we have established that a donkey chased every monkey, it is not possible for no donkeys to have chased a monkey.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- 3. Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- 5. A donkey chased a monkey.\n\nThe other statements are not necessarily true.",

This means that we can't conclude anything about the relationship between humans seeing Hazel and monkeys kicking Hazel.\n\nb. Alfred doesn't see Lewis.

This doesn't give us any information about who is awake or asleep, but it tells us that at least one of them is asleep.\n3. A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy. This means that a human saw Lewis and Lewis is happy.\n4. Alfred drank and every monkey drank. This tells us that Alfred drank and all monkeys drank.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. A human saw Lewis and Alfred drank. This statement is true because we know a human saw Lewis (from statement 3) and Alfred drank (from statement 4).\n\n2. A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Alfred drank. This statement is false because we know a human saw Lewis (from statement 3) and Alfred drank (from statement 4).\n\n3. Alfred didn't drink. This statement is false because we know Alfred drank (from statement 4).\n\n4. Lewis drank. This statement is false because we don't have any information about Lewis drinking. We only know that every monkey drank, but we don't know if Lewis is a monkey.\n\n5. Alfred and Lewis drank. This statement is false because we don't know if Lewis drank. We only know that Alfred drank (from statement 4).\n\n6. Alfred and Hazel drank. This statement is false because we don't know if Hazel drank. We only know that every monkey drank, but we don't know if Hazel is a monkey.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1. A human saw Lewis and Alfred drank.",
