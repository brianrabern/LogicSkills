Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Zindle is uffish.\n3. Every borogove snicker-snacked a tove.\n4. A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n5. It is not the case that Rafin is uffish.\n6. If a rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\n7. If Zindle won't burble, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Zindle and Rafin will burble.\n- We have no direct information about whether Zindle or Rafin will burble. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Zindle is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n- This statement combines two pieces of information directly provided: \"Zindle is uffish\" and \"A rath galumphed over Zindle.\" Both parts are true according to the given information, so this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Zindle will burble.\n- There is no direct information about whether Zindle will burble. The conditional statement involving Zindle not burbling does not provide enough information to determine if Zindle will burble.\n\n#### Statement 4: Zindle won't burble.\n- Similar to Statement 3, there is no direct information about whether Zindle will burble or not. The conditional statement does not provide enough information to conclude that Zindle won't burble.\n\n#### Statement 5: Zindle and Bungo will burble.\n- We do not have any information about Bungo's actions or characteristics related to burbling. Thus, we cannot conclude this statement as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A rath is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n- While we know that \"a rath galumphed over Zindle,\" we do not have information that confirms a rath is uffish. Zindle is uffish, but Zindle could be a tove, borogove, or rath. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 2: Zindle is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n\nThis statement directly combines two facts provided in the problem without requiring additional assumptions.",

It could be a tove, borogove, or rath.\n\n3. **Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - True, because it is explicitly stated that no toves galumphed over Bungo, which implies that not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n4. **Bungo galumphed over every tove.**\n   - We do not have information about whether Bungo galumphed over any toves, so we cannot conclude this.\n\n5. **Bungo galumphed over a tove.**\n   - We do not have information about whether Bungo galumphed over any toves, so we cannot conclude this.\n\n6. **Every tove galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - False, because it is explicitly stated that no toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement that must be true is 3.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Zindle and Bungo gyred.\n3. Not all toves gimbled.\n4. If not all toves will whiffle, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n5. Only borogoves will whiffle.\n6. A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Zindle and Bungo gyred**: This tells us that both Zindle and Bungo performed the action of gyring.\n- **Not all toves gimbled**: This means some toves did not gimble, but it doesn't give us specific information about Zindle or Bungo.\n- **If not all toves will whiffle, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo**:\n  - This conditional statement can be broken down into two parts:\n    - Part 1: \"If not all toves will whiffle\" (let's call this condition A).\n    - Part 2: \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo\" (let's call this condition B).\n  - The full statement is \"A implies B\".\n- **Only borogoves will whiffle**: This means that if something whiffles, it must be a borogove.\n- **A rath galumphed over Zindle**: This means Zindle was the target of a galumphing action by a rath.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle**:\n   - Since only borogoves will whiffle, for this to be true, both Zindle and Bungo would have to be borogoves. However, we don't have enough information to conclude this.\n   \n2. **Zindle won't whiffle**:\n   - Since only borogoves will whiffle, if Zindle is not a borogove, he won't whiffle. But we don't know what Zindle is.\n   \n3. **Zindle gyred and only borogoves will whiffle**:\n   - We know Zindle gyred, and we know only borogoves will whiffle. This statement is true based on the given information.\n   \n4. **Zindle gyred and not all borogoves will whiffle**:\n   - We know Zindle gyred, but the statement \"not all borogoves will whiffle\" contradicts the given information that only borogoves will whiffle. Thus, this cannot be true.\n   \n5. **Zindle gyred and no borogoves will whiffle**:\n   - We know Zindle gyred, but the statement \"no borogoves will whiffle\" contradicts the given information that only borogoves will whiffle. Thus, this cannot be true.\n   \n6. **Zindle will whiffle**:\n   - For Zindle to whiffle, he must be a borogove. We don't have enough information to conclude this.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3. Zindle gyred and only borogoves will whiffle.**\n\nThis statement aligns with the provided facts without making unsupported assumptions.",

It only states that no raths chortled at a tove, which doesn't imply anything about toves chortling at raths. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **A tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, there is no information provided that supports this claim. We do not know if any tove chortled at any rath, let alone every rath. Thus, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **No raths chortled at every tove.**\n   - This is directly supported by the given information: \"No raths chortled at a tove.\" Since no raths chortled at any tove, it follows that no raths chortled at every tove. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at every rath.**\n   - The information does not provide enough details to conclude this definitively. While we know that no raths chortled at a tove, there is no information about toves chortling at raths. Hence, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **Every tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - As with the previous statements involving toves chortling at raths, there is no information supporting this claim. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at a rath.**\n   - The information does not provide any evidence for this. We only know that no raths chortled at a tove, but nothing about toves chortling at raths. Thus, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. No raths chortled at every tove.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Every rath is mimsy.**\n   - This is false because Bungo is a rath and isn't mimsy.\n\n3. **No raths are mimsy.**\n   - This is also false because while Bungo isn't mimsy, we don't have information about other raths. It's possible for some raths to be mimsy.\n\n4. **Only raths are mimsy.**\n   - This is false because we know that Bungo, a rath, isn't mimsy. Additionally, since only borogoves are beamish, and being beamish is a distinct property from being mimsy, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Not all raths are mimsy.**\n   - This is true because Bungo is a rath and isn't mimsy, so it's established that not all raths are mimsy.\n\n6. **A rath is mimsy.**\n   - This cannot be concluded as true because while it's possible for some raths to be mimsy, we only know that Bungo, a rath, isn't mimsy.

However, it doesn't provide new information about specific individuals like Bungo or Zindle.\n\n3. **Every rath will whiffle or Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n   - This means either every rath will whiffle, or Zindle did not chortle at Rafin. It does not give us direct information about Bungo or other raths' actions.\n\n4. **A rath galumphed over Bungo unless every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This means if not every tove snicker-snacked Zindle, then a rath galumphed over Bungo. Since \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is given, it follows that a rath galumphed over Bungo.\n\n5. **If every rath chortled at Rafin, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin won't whiffle.**\n   - This conditional statement does not directly impact our conclusion about Bungo being galumphed over by a rath.\n\n6. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - This confirms that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, which aligns with the previous point about a rath galumphing over Bungo.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n1. **Bungo galumphed over a rath.**\n   - There is no information indicating that Bungo galumphed over a rath.\n\n2. **Not all raths galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - We do not have enough information to conclude this definitively.\n\n3. **A rath galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This is true based on the condition that a rath galumphed over Bungo unless every tove snicker-snacked Zindle, and we know not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n4. **Every rath galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - There is no information supporting this claim.\n\n5. **Bungo galumphed over every rath.**\n   - There is no information indicating this.\n\n6. **No raths galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This contradicts the information that a rath galumphed over Bungo.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**3.

The information only tells us what did not happen (no raths galumphed over a borogove) but does not provide enough detail about whether every borogove galumphed over a rath.\n\n2. **Every borogove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, we do not have sufficient information to conclude this. We know no raths galumphed over a borogove, but we don't know the actions of borogoves towards raths.\n\n3. **A borogove galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The given information does not provide any direct evidence that supports this claim. It only states what did not happen (no raths galumphed over a borogove).\n\n4. **No borogoves galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This statement could be true because we know no raths galumphed over a borogove, but we do not have information indicating that any borogove galumphed over a rath. Therefore, it is possible that no borogove galumphed over any rath, making this statement potentially true.\n\n5. **There is not a borogove that every rath galumphed over.**\n   - This statement must be true. Since no raths galumphed over a borogove, it logically follows that there cannot be a borogove that every rath galumphed over.\n\n6. **A borogove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information. We lack specific details about the interactions between borogoves and raths.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5. There is not a borogove that every rath galumphed over.**",

It could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle is a tove.\n\n2. **If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This statement is logically contradictory because it implies that if Bungo is not a borogove, he must be a borogove, which is impossible. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This statement is also logically contradictory for the same reason as the previous one. It suggests that Bungo being not a borogove implies he is a borogove, which is impossible. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't a tove.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, the information provided does not specify what Zindle is. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle is not a tove.\n\n5. **Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - We know from the information that every borogove chortled at Bungo, and Bungo did not chortle at Bungo. If Bungo were a borogove, he would have chortled at himself, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Bungo cannot be a borogove.\n\n6. **Bungo isn't a borogove.**\n   - Since Bungo cannot be a borogove (as explained above), this statement must be true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement that must be true is:\n6.

If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\nLet's analyze each part of the given information:\n\n- Since no toves galumphed over Bungo, according to point 5, Bungo cannot burble because it requires a tove to have galumphed over Bungo for Bungo to burble. Therefore, Bungo won't burble.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications for Zindle:\n- The condition about Zindle involves Bungo being beamish and the relationship between toves galumphing over Zindle and raths galumphing over Bungo. However, since we know that Bungo won't burble, we don't need to delve into the specifics of whether Bungo is beamish or not, as it doesn't affect the burbling of Zindle directly based on the provided information.\n\nThus, the only definitive conclusion we can draw from the given information is that Bungo won't burble.\n\nFinal Answer: 3.

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Not all borogoves are beamish but it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - The first part \"not all borogoves are beamish\" is true based on the given information.\n   - The second part \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" means \"Bungo did chortle at Bungo,\" which contradicts the given information. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **No borogoves are beamish or every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is a disjunction (OR statement). We need to check both parts:\n     - \"No borogoves are beamish\" is not necessarily true because we know not all borogoves are beamish, but some could be.\n     - \"Every borogove chortled at Bungo\" is not necessarily true either, as we don't have enough information to confirm this.\n   - Since neither part is necessarily true, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n4. **Not all borogoves are beamish but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - The first part \"not all borogoves are beamish\" is true based on the given information.\n   - The second part \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is also true based on the given information.\n   - Both parts are consistent with the given information, so this statement can be true.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves are beamish and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - The first part \"not all borogoves are beamish\" is true based on the given information.\n   - The second part \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" contradicts the given information.

It only specifies a reciprocal relationship between some toves and borogoves. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n2. **There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over**:\n   - This statement suggests a specific tove that all borogoves galumphed over. However, the given information does not provide enough detail to confirm this. The reciprocal relationship does not guarantee such a specific tove.\n\n3. **A tove galumphed over a borogove**:\n   - This is directly supported by the condition \"Every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it.\" Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove**:\n   - The given condition only states that every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it, not necessarily every borogove. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n5. **A tove galumphed over every borogove**:\n   - Similar to statement 2, this would require a specific tove that galumphed over all borogoves, which is not guaranteed by the given information.\n\n6. **No toves galumphed over a borogove**:\n   - This contradicts the given condition \"Every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3.

We only know Bungo is mimsy. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n   - It is explicitly stated that Zindle gyred. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Zindle isn't mimsy and Bungo isn't mimsy.**\n   - We know Zindle is mimsy and Bungo is mimsy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't mimsy but it is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy.**\n   - Zindle is mimsy, so the first part of this statement is false. However, the second part is true because Bungo is mimsy. Since the conjunction of these two parts is false, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.**\n   - Both Zindle and Bungo are confirmed to be mimsy. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n   - We know Zindle gyred, but there is no information about whether Bungo gyred. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement that must be true in this situation is:\n5. Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.",

Since every borogove will whiffle, it means that all borogoves have the property of whiffling.\n2. The statement \"A rath galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over a rath\" does not provide direct information about whiffling but indicates interactions between different types.\n3. The condition involving Rafin and Zindle does not directly impact the whiffling property.\n4. The condition involving Zindle and Bungo also does not directly impact the whiffling property.\n5. The fact that a borogove chortled at Rafin and Bungo is not a rath do not affect the whiffling property directly.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the information provided:\n\n1. **No borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every borogove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Only borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This aligns with the given information that every borogove will whiffle, and there is no indication that other types (toves or raths) will whiffle. Thus, this statement could be true.\n\n3. **Only borogoves will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This is a contradiction because it states both that only borogoves will whiffle and that no borogoves will whiffle. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Only borogoves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This is contradictory because it states that only borogoves will whiffle (which is true) but then says not all borogoves will whiffle, which contradicts the given information that every borogove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every borogove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **A borogove will whiffle.**\n   - This is consistent with the given information that every borogove will whiffle.

Everything is exclusively a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\" - This means Zindle did not perform the action of snicker-snacking on itself.\n4. \"It is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" - This means Bungo did chortle at Bungo.\n5. \"Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle only if Bungo is a borogove\" - This can be rephrased as: If Bungo is not a borogove, then Zindle did chortle at Zindle.\n6. \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" - This implies that Rafin was chortled at by a borogove.\n7. \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" - This means if something is a rath, it performed the action of snicker-snacking on Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, we know Zindle did not snicker-snack Zindle.\n- From point 4, we know Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n- From point 5, if Bungo is not a borogove, then Zindle chortled at Zindle. Since Bungo chortled at Bungo, Bungo could be a borogove or a tove (since it's not specified that only borogoves can chortle at themselves).\n- From point 6, since a borogove chortled at Rafin, Rafin cannot be a borogove (because a borogove cannot chortle at another borogove based on the given information).\n- From point 7, if Zindle were a rath, it would have snicker-snacked itself, which contradicts point 3. Therefore, Zindle cannot be a rath.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis:\n- Zindle cannot be a rath (point 7 and point 3).\n- Rafin cannot be a borogove (point 6).\n\nThus, the statements that must be true are:\n- **3. Zindle isn't a rath.**\n- **4. Rafin isn't a borogove.**\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are 3 and 4.",

The only information about burbling is that a borogove will burble, but it does not specify which one.\n\n4. **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - False, because no borogove snicker-snacked Rafin (from point 2).\n\n5. **A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - False, because no borogove snicker-snacked Rafin (from point 2).\n\n6. **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - True, because no borogove snicker-snacked Rafin (from point 2).

While it might be true, it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - We only know that Zindle snicker-snacked Rafin, who is a tove.

Since Rafin isn't a tove and isn't uffish, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n2. Given that a borogove is uffish and Rafin isn't uffish, Rafin cannot be a borogove.\n3. Therefore, Rafin must be a rath.\n4. Since Rafin is a rath and didn't chortle at Bungo, the rath that chortled at Bungo must be another rath.\n5. The statement \"No toves galumphed over Zindle or a rath galumphed over Rafin\" implies that either no toves galumphed over Zindle, or a rath did galumph over Rafin, or both.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A borogove is uffish and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - True: We know a borogove is uffish and Rafin isn't a tove.\n\n2. **A borogove is uffish but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - False: This contradicts the fact that Rafin isn't a tove.\n\n3. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - Cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n4. **Zindle and Rafin are uffish.**\n   - False: Rafin isn't uffish.\n\n5. **Every borogove is uffish but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - False: This contradicts the fact that Rafin isn't a tove.\n\n6. **Every borogove is uffish and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - True: We know every borogove is uffish and Rafin isn't a tove.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1.

Therefore, if there is at least one tove, Bungo chortled at all of them.\n\n3. **Zindle snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - This indicates that Zindle performed an action (snicker-snacked) on at least one tove. However, this does not provide direct information about chortling.\n\n4. **If a rath chortled at Zindle, then every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This conditional statement tells us that if any rath chortled at Zindle, then all raths must have chortled at Rafin.

We know Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle, but this doesn't specify Zindle's type. Hence, we can't conclude this statement must be true.\n\n4. **A rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - Since every rath galumphed over Rafin, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Rafin galumphed over every rath.**\n   - There is no information provided about Rafin's actions towards raths. This statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Rafin galumphed over a rath.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, there is no information about Rafin's actions towards raths.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Either Bungo or Rafin is beamish.\n4. If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n5. Only borogoves are beamish.\n6. It is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy (which means Bungo is mimsy).\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 5, we know that only borogoves can be beamish.\n- From point 6, Bungo is mimsy.\n- Since Bungo is mimsy and only borogoves are beamish, Bungo must be a borogove.\n- Since Bungo is a borogove and beamish, and from point 3, either Bungo or Rafin is beamish, Rafin cannot be beamish because only borogoves are beamish and Bungo already satisfies the condition.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - The information provided does not give us enough details about Zindle's status regarding being mimsy. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Every borogove is beamish.**\n   - We know that only borogoves are beamish, but we do not have information stating that every borogove must be beamish. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No borogoves are beamish.**\n   - This contradicts the fact that Bungo is a borogove and is beamish. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - The information does not provide enough detail to confirm or deny this statement directly. However, since Bungo is a borogove and mimsy, and there are other borogoves (as there is at least one of each type), it is possible that not all borogoves are mimsy. But we cannot definitively say this is true without more specific information.\n\n5. **Only borogoves are beamish and not all borogoves are beamish.**\n   - The first part \"only borogoves are beamish\" is true. However, the second part \"not all borogoves are beamish\" cannot be confirmed with certainty based on the given information.\n\n6. **A borogove is beamish.**\n   - Since Bungo is a borogove and is beamish, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**6.

It only states what Rafin did.\n- **Conclusion:** This cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all toves chortled at Rafin.\n- Similar to Statement 2, there is no information about toves chortling at Rafin.\n- **Conclusion:** This cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.\n- Again, there is no information about toves chortling at Rafin. Additionally, the information does not specify what type Rafin is.\n- **Conclusion:** This cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every tove chortled at Rafin.\n- The information does not provide any details about toves chortling at Rafin.\n- **Conclusion:** This cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: A tove chortled at Rafin.\n- Similar to the previous statements, there is no information about toves chortling at Rafin.\n- **Conclusion:** This cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 1: Rafin chortled at a tove.**",

This statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **A rath chortled at Zindle.**\n   - According to point 6, every rath chortled at Zindle. This means that it is true that at least one rath chortled at Zindle. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Not all raths chortled at Zindle.**\n   - Point 6 states that every rath chortled at Zindle, which directly contradicts this statement.

A borogove chortled at Zindle just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since a tove chortles at every tove, and no toves chortled at Rafin or Bungo, it means neither Rafin nor Bungo can be a tove (otherwise, they would have been chortled at by other toves).\n- This leaves Rafin and Bungo as either a borogove or a rath.\n- The condition about the borogove chortling at Zindle only happens if every rath snicker-snacks Bungo. This implies that Zindle could be a borogove or a rath, but not necessarily a tove since we don't have direct information about Zindle being a tove.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Zindle is a tove.**\n   - We do not have enough information to conclude that Zindle is a tove. Zindle could be a borogove or a rath based on the given conditions.\n   \n2. **Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - Correct. Since no toves chortled at Rafin, Rafin cannot be a tove.\n   \n3. **Zindle isn't a tove.**\n   - We cannot definitively say Zindle isn't a tove. The information provided does not exclude the possibility of Zindle being a tove.\n   \n4. **Rafin is a tove.**\n   - Incorrect. As explained above, Rafin cannot be a tove because no toves chortled at Rafin.\n   \n5. **Bungo is a tove.**\n   - Incorrect. Similar to Rafin, Bungo cannot be a tove because no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2.

However, logically, an entity cannot perform an action on itself in this context. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - The condition for Bungo to burble is if Zindle is mimsy. There is no information about whether Zindle is mimsy or not, so we can't conclude anything about Zindle burbling from this alone. This statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n3. **Bungo galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - As explained above, Bungo being a rath means he would have galumphed over every rath, including himself. However, logically, this is impossible. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n4. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Zindle will burble (it depends on whether Zindle is mimsy). There is no information about Rafin burbling. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n5. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, we don't know if Zindle is mimsy, so we can't conclude that Zindle will burble. This statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n6. **Zindle and Bungo will burble.**\n   - For Bungo to burble, Zindle needs to be mimsy.

Thus, we cannot conclude that Zindle will burble.\n\n3. **Not all borogoves chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This directly contradicts the condition \"Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Zindle chortled at a borogove.**\n   - The information does not provide any details about Zindle performing actions towards borogoves. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as true.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Zindle.**\n   - Since every borogove chortled at Zindle, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Zindle chortled at every borogove.**\n   - The information does not provide any details about Zindle performing actions towards borogoves.

Since we know there is not a tove that every tove snicker-snacked, it means no tove can snicker-snack every borogove. However, this does not rule out the possibility that some tove snicker-snacked a borogove. Therefore, this statement could be true but is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n2. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This directly contradicts the information that there is not a tove that every tove snicker-snacked. If a tove snicker-snacked every borogove, then every tove would have snicker-snacked that tove, which is not possible according to the given conditions. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This aligns with the information that there is not a tove that every tove snicker-snacked. If no tove snicker-snacked every borogove, then no tove would be snicker-snacked by every other tove, which fits the given condition. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This is impossible because it would imply that every tove snicker-snacked every other tove, which contradicts the given condition that there is not a tove that every tove snicker-snacked. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. While it is true that no tove snicker-snacked every borogove, it does not mean that no tove snicker-snacked any borogove. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The given information does not provide enough detail to conclude that every tove snicker-snacked at least one borogove. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n3.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. No toves snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.\n4. Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n5. Only borogoves gimbled.\n6. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n7. It is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo (implying Bungo did snicker-snack Bungo).\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle gimbled.**\n   - The information states that only borogoves gimbled. Therefore, for Zindle to have gimbled, Zindle would need to be a borogove. However, we do not have enough information to determine Zindle's type definitively. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Every tove gimbled.**\n   - Since only borogoves gimbled, no toves could have gimbled. This statement is false.\n\n3. **Only toves gimbled.**\n   - We know that only borogoves gimbled, so this statement is false.\n\n4. **A tove gimbled.**\n   - As established, only borogoves gimbled, so no toves gimbled. This statement is false.\n\n5. **Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - This statement involves a conditional relationship about being \"mimsy,\" which is not defined in the given context. Without additional information about what \"mimsy\" means or how it applies to borogoves, we cannot determine the truth of this statement.\n\n6. **Not all toves gimbled.**\n   - Since only borogoves gimbled, it follows that no toves gimbled, which implies that not all toves gimbled. This statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**6. Not all toves gimbled.**",

Therefore, this statement might be true, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n2. **No toves chortled at a rath.**\n   - This contradicts the given condition that every tove chortled at a rath. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **A tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - The given condition only states that every tove chortled at a rath, not necessarily every rath. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, the given condition does not imply that every tove chortled at every rath. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **There is a tove that every rath chortled at.**\n   - The given information does not provide enough details to confirm this statement.

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This statement is false because it contradicts the given information that \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle,\" implying that some toves did snicker-snack Zindle.\n\n6. **A tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - Since \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle,\" it means that some toves did snicker-snack Zindle. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nFinal Answer: The statements that must be true in this situation are 4 and 6.",

Given the condition \"every rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it,\" this implies a recursive relationship where if a rath galumphed over another, it would also have been galumphed over by others. However, this does not necessarily mean every rath has galumphed over another rath directly. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No raths galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This statement claims that there is no single rath that galumphed over all other raths. The given conditions do not provide enough information to definitively conclude this. It is possible that some rath could have galumphed over all others, so this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n3. **A rath galumphed over every rath.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, this suggests that there exists at least one rath that galumphed over all other raths. Again, the given conditions do not provide sufficient information to confirm this. Thus, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n4. **A rath galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This statement asserts that there is at least one instance where a rath galumphed over another rath. Given that \"a rath galumphed over Zindle\" and assuming Zindle is a rath, this statement is true because it directly follows from the given information.\n\n5. **Every rath galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This statement suggests a complete mutual galumphing among all raths. The given conditions do not support this level of universality. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.**\n   - This statement aligns with the given condition \"every rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.\" Since this is directly stated in the problem, this statement must be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 4: A rath galumphed over a rath.\n- Statement 6: A rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 4 and 6 must be true.",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Zindle will whiffle.\n3. Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle only if a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n4. Not all borogoves will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4, we know that \"no borogoves will whiffle.\" This means that if something is a borogove, it will not whiffle.\n- Point 2 states that \"Zindle will whiffle.\" Since no borogoves will whiffle, Zindle cannot be a borogove. Therefore, Zindle must be either a tove or a rath.\n- The statement \"Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle only if a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo\" can be rephrased as: If a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo, then Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle. However, since the condition about chortling is not directly relevant to whether Zindle will whiffle, we can focus on the whiffle condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that Zindle will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle, Zindle cannot be a borogove. Thus, Zindle must be either a tove or a rath.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Bungo will whiffle.** - There is no information provided about Bungo whiffling, so this cannot be determined.\n2. **Zindle is a borogove.** - False, because Zindle will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.\n3. **Zindle won't whiffle.** - False, because it is stated that Zindle will whiffle.\n4. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.** - Cannot be determined for Bungo, but Zindle will whiffle.\n5. **Bungo and Zindle will whiffle.** - Cannot be determined for Bungo, but Zindle will whiffle.\n6. **Zindle isn't a borogove.** - True, because Zindle will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n6.

It only tells us about raths snicker-snacking toves under certain conditions. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, there is no information indicating that every tove snicker-snacked a rath. We only know that every rath snicker-snacked a tove, which doesn't imply the reverse action for every tove. Thus, this statement also cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This statement is a negation of the first statement. Since we cannot confirm the first statement, we also cannot confirm its negation. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true either.\n\n4. **A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - The information does not directly support this statement. However, since every rath snicker-snacked a tove, it suggests some interaction between raths and toves, but it does not necessarily mean a tove snicker-snacked a rath. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - As with the previous statements, there is no information supporting that every tove snicker-snacked every rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **A rath snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - According to the given information, \"every rath snicker-snacked a tove.\" This means that at least one rath snicker-snacked a tove, which satisfies the condition of \"a rath snicker-snacked a tove.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n6.

Since everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and Rafin is not a tove, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This cannot be concluded from the given information. The statement \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin or Rafin is a tove\" implies that if Rafin is not a tove, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin. Since Rafin is not a tove, this means not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This also cannot be concluded. We only know that not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, which does not imply that no borogoves did so. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This is directly supported by the information \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin or Rafin is a tove,\" and since Rafin is not a tove, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Rafin snicker-snacked any borogoves. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, there is no information provided about whether Rafin snicker-snacked any borogoves.

It only states that for each rath, there is another rath that it galumphed over. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n3. **There is a rath that every rath galumphed over.**\n   - The condition \"Every rath galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it\" suggests a chain of galumphing among raths, but it does not guarantee that there is a single rath that all others galumphed over. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n4. **No raths galumphed over a rath.**\n   - This contradicts the condition \"Every rath galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it,\" which implies that some raths did galumph over other raths. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5. **A rath galumphed over every rath.**\n   - The condition \"Every rath galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it\" does not provide enough information to conclude that a single rath galumphed over every other rath.

This creates a non-symmetric relationship among borogoves.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This indicates that Rafin is not a tove because if Rafin were a tove, then no toves would chortle at Rafin, which contradicts the fact that Rafin is a tove (since a tove would chortle at itself).\n\n4. **Every borogove chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This means Zindle must be something that all borogoves chortle at. Since no borogove can chortle at another borogove that chortled at it, Zindle cannot be a borogove.\n\n5. **Every rath galumphed over Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - Rafin being a rath is consistent with the information since Rafin isn't a tove and raths galumph over Rafin.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Zindle isn't a borogove.**\n   - True, because if Zindle were a borogove, then some borogoves would chortle at Zindle, which would violate the rule that no borogove chortles at a borogove that chortled at it.\n\n2. **Rafin is a tove.**\n   - False, because it was stated that Rafin isn't a tove.\n\n3. **Zindle is a borogove.**\n   - False, based on the same reasoning as statement 1.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't a tove.**\n   - True, because Zindle must be something that all borogoves chortle at, and since no toves chortle at Rafin (and thus not at Zindle if Zindle were a tove), Zindle cannot be a tove.\n\n5. **Zindle is a tove.**\n   - False, for the same reason as statement 4.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are:\n- **Zindle isn't a borogove.**\n- **Zindle isn't a tove.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 1 and 4 must be true.",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every tove chortled at Bungo.\n3. Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n4. Only borogoves gyred.\n5. Not all toves chortled at Rafin only if not all toves are beamish.\n6. If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin is beamish.\n7. Zindle isn't beamish.\n8. It is not the case that Rafin gyred.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Bungo isn't a tove.\n- Since every tove chortled at Bungo, and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo, Bungo cannot be a tove because a tove would have chortled at itself, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n#### Statement 2: Zindle and Rafin gyred.\n- From the information, only borogoves gyred. We know Rafin did not gyre, so Rafin is not a borogove. This means Rafin could be either a tove or a rath. Since Rafin did not gyre, Zindle could still be a borogove and gyre. However, we do not have enough information to confirm that Zindle gyred. Thus, **Statement 2 is false**.\n\n#### Statement 3: Zindle gyred.\n- As mentioned above, only borogoves gyred. Since Zindle isn't beamish, it doesn't provide direct information about whether Zindle is a borogove or not. Without additional information, we cannot definitively say Zindle gyred. Thus, **Statement 3 is false**.\n\n#### Statement 4: Bungo is a tove.\n- Contradicts Statement 1, which we determined to be true. Therefore, **Statement 4 is false**.\n\n#### Statement 5: Zindle and Bungo gyred.\n- Bungo cannot be a tove (as per Statement 1) and thus cannot gyre since only borogoves gyre. Therefore, **Statement 5 is false**.\n\n#### Statement 6: Zindle didn't gyre.\n- Since only borogoves gyre and we don't have specific information about Zindle being a borogove, we cannot definitively conclude that Zindle didn't gyre. However, given that Zindle isn't beamish and no other information suggests Zindle is a borogove, it is reasonable to infer that Zindle likely didn't gyre. But without more specific information, we can't conclusively determine this. Thus, **Statement 6 is uncertain based on the provided information**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 1 - Bungo isn't a tove.**",

If Tove A snicker-snacks Tove B, then Tove B must also snicker-snack Tove A.\n\n4. **Only borogoves are beamish and every borogove is uffish.**\n   - This tells us about the properties of borogoves but does not directly affect the snicker-snacking behavior.\n\n5. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This is a conditional statement indicating that if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then it is true that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. However, if some toves did snicker-snack Zindle, this statement does not provide information about the rest of the toves' behavior towards Zindle.\n\n6. **If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is a complex conditional statement involving borogoves, raths, and Bungo. It suggests a dependency between the actions of borogoves, raths, and Bungo, but it does not directly inform us about the snicker-snacking behavior among toves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the provided statements:\n\n1. **No toves snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - This cannot be determined from the given information alone. The mutual snicker-snacking condition does not exclude the possibility that a tove could snicker-snack every other tove.\n\n2. **A tove snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - Given the mutual snicker-snacking condition, if there is at least one tove, it is possible for a tove to snicker-snack another tove. Therefore, this statement can be true.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - Based on the mutual snicker-snacking condition, if a tove snicker-snacks another tove, the other tove must also snicker-snack back. Thus, every tove would indeed snicker-snack at least one tove (itself or another).\n\n4. **A tove snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - This cannot be determined from the given information. While it is possible, it is not necessarily true based on the provided conditions.\n\n5. **Every tove snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, this cannot be determined from the given information. The mutual snicker-snacking condition does not guarantee that every tove snicker-snacks every other tove.\n\n6. **A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.**\n   - This is directly supported by the mutual snicker-snacking condition. If a tove snicker-snacks another tove, the other tove must also snicker-snack it back.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- 2. A tove snicker-snacked a tove.\n- 3. Every tove snicker-snacked a tove.\n- 6. A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 2, 3, and 6 must be true.",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n3. There is a rath that every borogove chortled at.\n4. There is not a rath that every tove snicker-snacked.\n5. Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo if and only if not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n6. If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A borogove chortled at a rath.\n- From condition 3, we know there is a rath that every borogove chortled at. This directly implies that at least one borogove chortled at a rath. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a borogove that every rath chortled at.\n- The given information does not provide any direct evidence about whether every rath chortled at a specific borogove. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: No borogoves chortled at every rath.\n- Condition 3 states that there is a rath that every borogove chortled at. This means that at least one rath was chortled at by every borogove, which contradicts this statement. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every borogove chortled at every rath.\n- Condition 3 only tells us that there is at least one rath that every borogove chortled at, but it doesn't imply that every borogove chortled at every rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: No borogoves chortled at a rath.\n- Condition 3 directly contradicts this statement because it states that there is a rath that every borogove chortled at. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A borogove chortled at every rath.\n- Condition 3 states that there is a rath that every borogove chortled at, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that a single borogove chortled at every rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 1: A borogove chortled at a rath.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Everything is exclusively a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. No toves chortled at Rafin.\n4. Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n5. If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n6. Not all borogoves will whiffle.\n7. Every tove will whiffle.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Rafin will whiffle or every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We don't have direct information about whether Rafin will whiffle or not. The condition \"every borogove chortled at Bungo\" is not necessarily true either. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Not all borogoves will whiffle but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know from the given information that not all borogoves will whiffle. However, it is stated that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo, so the second part of this statement contradicts the given information. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo and a borogove will whiffle.**\n   - It is given that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo. Since not all borogoves will whiffle, it implies that some borogoves will whiffle. This statement can be true.\n\n4. **Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - It is given that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo, but it is also given that not all borogoves will whiffle, which means some borogoves will whiffle. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves will whiffle and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - Both parts of this statement are directly supported by the given information. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Rafin will whiffle unless every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Rafin will whiffle or not. Additionally, the condition \"every borogove chortled at Bungo\" is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5. Not all borogoves will whiffle and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**",

Only borogoves gimbled.\n6. No raths chortled at Rafin if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.\n7. Zindle gyred and only toves gimbled.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Bungo isn't a rath**: This means Bungo is either a tove or a borogove.\n- **No toves chortled at a tove**: This implies that toves do not interact with other toves through chortling.\n- **No toves chortled at Rafin**: This suggests that Rafin cannot be a tove because if he were, no toves would chortle at him, which contradicts the exclusivity of categories.\n- **Only borogoves gimbled**: This means that if something gimbled, it must be a borogove.\n- **No raths chortled at Rafin if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo**: This conditional statement links the actions of raths and borogoves.\n- **Zindle gyred and only toves gimbled**: This indicates that Zindle is a tove since only toves gimbled.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Rafin gyred**:\n   - There is no direct information about whether Rafin gyred or not. We can't conclude this from the given data.\n   \n2. **Zindle gyred and Bungo is a rath**:\n   - Zindle did gyre, but Bungo is not a rath. Therefore, this statement is false.\n   \n3. **Zindle didn't gyre**:\n   - It is explicitly stated that Zindle gyred. Thus, this statement is false.\n   \n4. **Zindle gyred but it is not the case that Bungo is a rath**:\n   - Zindle did gyre, and Bungo is not a rath. This statement is true.\n   \n5. **Zindle and Bungo gyred**:\n   - While Zindle did gyre, there is no information indicating that Bungo gyred. Hence, this statement is false.\n   \n6. **Zindle and Rafin gyred**:\n   - Zindle did gyre, but there is no information about Rafin gyring.

However, since \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo,\" we can infer that Bungo could be a borogove or a rath because toves don't chortle at themselves.

Since no toves chortled at Rafin, it follows that Rafin did chortle at Rafin.\n   - Conclusion: This statement is false.\n\n3. **Rafin is a tove.**\n   - We know no toves chortled at Rafin, so if Rafin were a tove, it would contradict the rule that no toves chortled at Rafin. Thus, Rafin cannot be a tove.\n   - Conclusion: This statement is false.\n\n4. **Bungo isn't a tove.**\n   - As analyzed earlier, since no toves galumphed over Bungo and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo, Bungo cannot be a tove.\n   - Conclusion: This statement is true.\n\n5. **Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - As analyzed earlier, since no toves chortled at Rafin, Rafin cannot be a tove.\n   - Conclusion: This statement is true.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 4 and 5 must be true in this situation.",

If Zindle won't burble, then not all toves chortled at Bungo only if a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A rath chortled at a rath.\n- This statement is likely true because if no raths chortled at any other rath, it would contradict the second condition (every rath chortled at every rath that chortled at it). Therefore, there must be at least one instance where a rath chortled at another rath.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is not a rath that every rath chortled at.\n- This statement is true based on the third condition which states \"No raths chortled at every rath.\" Thus, there cannot be a single rath that every other rath chortled at.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every rath chortled at a rath.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The second condition only implies that if a rath chortled at another rath, the latter will chortle back. It does not guarantee that every rath chortled at some other rath.\n\n#### Statement 4: A rath chortled at every rath.\n- This statement is false based on the third condition which explicitly states that no rath chortled at every rath.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every rath chortled at every rath.\n- This statement is false for the same reason as Statement 4. The third condition directly contradicts this possibility.\n\n#### Statement 6: No raths chortled at a rath.\n- This statement is false. As per the analysis of Statement 1, we concluded that at least one rath must have chortled at another rath.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given conditions are:\n- **Statement 1**: A rath chortled at a rath.\n- **Statement 2**: There is not a rath that every rath chortled at.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**Statements 1 and 2 must be true.**",

We only know that not all toves will whiffle, but we don't have specific information about Zindle and Bungo's whiffling status. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **Zindle won't whiffle.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, there is no direct information about Zindle's whiffling behavior. This cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - Again, there is no specific information about Zindle and Rafin's whiffling behavior. This cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Rafin chortled at Zindle and Rafin is uffish.**\n   - It is stated that Rafin chortled at Zindle, which is true. However, it is also stated that Rafin isn't uffish. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Rafin chortled at Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin is uffish.**\n   - Rafin chortled at Zindle, which is true. Additionally, it is stated that Rafin isn't uffish, which aligns with the given information. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - As with the other whiffling statements, there is no specific information about Zindle's whiffling behavior. This cannot be concluded as true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5. Rafin chortled at Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin is uffish.**",

Thus, this statement must be true.\n   \n4. **No raths gimbled.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given condition \"Every rath gimbled.\" Hence, this statement must be false.\n   \n5. **Bungo gimbled.**\n   - We do not have enough information about Bungo to determine whether Bungo gimbled or not.
