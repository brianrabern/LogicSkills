Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw a monkey.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given condition that every donkey saw a monkey. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **There is a donkey that every monkey saw.**\n   - The information provided does not give us enough details about whether every monkey saw a specific donkey. We only know that every donkey saw a monkey, not vice versa. Hence, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **A donkey saw a monkey.**\n   - This is directly supported by the condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\" Since there is at least one donkey, and every donkey saw a monkey, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **A donkey saw every monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, the condition only states that every donkey saw a monkey, not every single monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw every monkey.**\n   - As with statements 1 and 5, we do not have enough information to conclude that no donkey saw every monkey. The condition only specifies that every donkey saw at least one monkey, not limiting the number of monkeys seen by a donkey. Thus, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4.

This means that at least one monkey (and actually all monkeys) saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - As explained above, since Hazel saw every monkey, it implies that all monkeys saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This directly contradicts the fact that Hazel saw every monkey, which implies that all monkeys saw Hazel.\n   - Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a monkey.**\n   - The information explicitly states that Hazel saw every monkey, so she certainly saw at least one monkey.\n   - Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- 3.

Therefore, it is true that a human kicked a donkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey kicked a human.\n- The \"Donkey-Kicking Condition\" does not provide information about whether a donkey kicked a human. It only states that there is a donkey that every human kicked. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- The \"Donkey-Kicking Condition\" only specifies that there is a single donkey that every human kicked. It does not imply that every donkey kicked every human. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- Similar to Statement 3, the \"Donkey-Kicking Condition\" does not provide enough information to conclude that every donkey kicked a human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey kicked every human.\n- The \"Donkey-Kicking Condition\" states that there is a donkey that every human kicked, which implies that this particular donkey was kicked by every human. However, it does not imply that this donkey (or any other donkey) kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- Since the \"Donkey-Kicking Condition\" only tells us that there is a donkey that every human kicked, it does not provide information about whether any donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that can be concluded as necessarily true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 1: A human kicked a donkey.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

However, since only donkeys are asleep, and Alfred is not a human, this condition does not directly affect Alfred's status.\n- Since not all donkeys chased Alfred, Alfred cannot be a donkey (because if Alfred were a donkey, all other donkeys would have chased him, contradicting the given information).\n\nThus, Alfred must be a monkey.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Alfred isn't a human**: True, as Alfred is a monkey.\n2. **Alfred is asleep**: False, as only donkeys are asleep and Alfred is a monkey.\n3. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep**: False, as Alfred is not asleep.\n4. **Alfred is a human**: False, as Alfred is a monkey.\n5. **Lewis is asleep**: True, as Lewis is a donkey and only donkeys are asleep.\n6. **Alfred isn't asleep**: True, as Alfred is a monkey and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Alfred isn't a human.\n5. Lewis is asleep.\n6. Alfred isn't asleep.",

Lewis didn't chase Hazel.\n6. Not all humans kicked Alfred just in case no monkeys saw Alfred.\n7. If every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nLet's break down these conditions and analyze them:\n\n- From condition 2: Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n- From condition 3: Lewis saw Alfred.\n- From condition 4: Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n- From condition 5: Lewis didn't chase Hazel.\n- From condition 6: This implies that if no monkeys saw Alfred, then not all humans kicked Alfred. However, since Lewis saw Alfred (condition 3), this condition doesn't provide additional information about the current scenario.\n- From condition 7: If every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel. This means that if every monkey saw Lewis, then for Alfred not to have kicked Hazel, it must be the case that not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.**\n   - There is no direct information linking Alfred kicking Hazel with monkeys chasing Lewis. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true from the given conditions.\n\n2. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.**\n   - We know Hazel didn't chase Alfred (condition 2) and not all monkeys kicked Lewis (condition 4). Thus, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred and every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - While Hazel didn't chase Alfred (condition 2), we know not all monkeys kicked Lewis (condition 4). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then not all monkeys chased Lewis.**\n   - There is no direct link between Alfred kicking Hazel and monkeys chasing Lewis. Hence, this cannot be concluded as true from the given conditions.\n\n5. **If every monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - The given conditions do not provide enough information to conclude this relationship. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Lewis didn't chase Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - We know Lewis didn't chase Hazel (condition 5), but there is no information about whether a monkey kicked Alfred. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer:** Statement 2: Hazel didn't chase Alfred and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.",

Therefore, no human can fail to see another human.\n\n2. **Every monkey saw every donkey that saw it**: This implies that if a donkey \\(D\\) saw a monkey \\(M\\), then \\(M\\) saw \\(D\\).

If every human had chased Hazel, it would contradict the given condition.\n\n2. **Hazel chased a human.**\n   - The information does not provide any details about whether Hazel chased anyone. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every human chased Hazel.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given condition that there is not a donkey that every human chased. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n4. **A human chased Hazel.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine if at least one human chased Hazel. It could be possible, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Hazel chased every human.**\n   - Again, there is no information indicating that Hazel chased any humans, let alone every human. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **No humans chased Hazel.**\n   - This statement is also not necessarily true. While it is possible that no humans chased Hazel, the given information does not confirm this definitively.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**1.

If Alfred ate, then every monkey chased Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\n- This statement suggests that no monkey saw another monkey who also saw them back.\n- However, since every monkey saw every monkey, this means that if Monkey A saw Monkey B, Monkey B also saw Monkey A. Therefore, this statement cannot be true because it contradicts the given condition that every monkey saw every other monkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is not a monkey that every monkey saw.\n- Since every monkey saw every monkey, this means that every monkey was seen by every other monkey. Thus, this statement is false because it contradicts the given condition.\n\n#### Statement 3: No monkeys saw every monkey.\n- This statement directly contradicts the given condition that every monkey saw every monkey. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: No monkeys saw a monkey.\n- This statement is false because it contradicts the given condition that every monkey saw every monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred will run.\n- The problem does not provide enough information about whether Alfred will run or not. It only mentions a conditional statement involving Alfred eating and donkeys eating. Without additional context, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A monkey saw every monkey.\n- This statement aligns with the given condition that every monkey saw every monkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**Statement 6: A monkey saw every monkey.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

If Alfred is not a human, we have no information about his hunger status. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily hold true.\n\n3. **A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry.**\n   - We know no humans are hungry, so Hazel cannot be hungry. However, we do not have information about whether a human saw Alfred. This statement does not necessarily hold true as it depends on additional information not provided.\n\n4. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no humans are hungry.**\n   - We know Alfred doesn't see Hazel and no humans are hungry. The condition \"no humans are hungry\" is met, and the result \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" is also true. This statement holds true based on the given conditions.\n\n5. **If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.**\n   - We know no humans are hungry. However, we have no information about whether Alfred saw Alfred or whether every human saw Hazel. This statement does not necessarily hold true as it depends on additional information not provided.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel are hungry.**\n   - Since no humans are hungry, if either Alfred or Hazel is a human, they cannot be hungry. Therefore, this statement cannot be true if either is a human. If neither is a human, we have no information about their hunger status, but since the statement requires both to be hungry, it does not necessarily hold true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true given the conditions is:\n\n**Final Answer: 4. Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no humans are hungry.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. A human saw a human that saw a monkey.\n4. Hazel didn't chase Alfred and every human saw Alfred.\n5. A human chased Lewis only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n6. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey saw Lewis.\n7. A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Point 3**: A human saw a human that saw a monkey. This means there is a chain of observation: Human -> Human -> Monkey.\n- **Point 4**: Hazel didn't chase Alfred and every human saw Alfred. This implies Alfred was seen by all humans.\n- **Point 5**: A human chased Lewis only if every donkey saw Hazel. This suggests a conditional relationship between chasing and seeing.\n- **Point 6**: If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey saw Lewis. This is a complex conditional statement involving self-chasing and seeing.\n- **Point 7**: A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey. Thus, Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Alfred saw every human**:\n   - The information does not provide any direct evidence about what Alfred saw. It only states that every human saw Alfred. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement is true.\n\n2. **Alfred saw a human**:\n   - Again, no direct information about what Alfred saw. We can't confirm this statement based on the given information.\n\n3. **No humans saw Alfred**:\n   - Contradicts point 4 which states that every human saw Alfred. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred is a donkey**:\n   - There is no direct information indicating Alfred's species. However, since every human saw Alfred, and there is no restriction on who can see whom, Alfred could be a donkey, human, or monkey. We cannot definitively say Alfred is a donkey.\n\n5. **A human saw Alfred**:\n   - Point 4 states that every human saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Not all humans saw Alfred**:\n   - Directly contradicts point 4 which states that every human saw Alfred. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5. A human saw Alfred.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Thus, this statement is false.\n\n4. **A human will attack and no humans will attack.**\n   - This statement contains a contradiction: it cannot be true that both a human will attack and no humans will attack simultaneously. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Lewis ate and no humans will run.**\n   - We know that Lewis ate, which is true. Also, it is stated that no humans will run, which is true. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - Since Alfred is a human and no humans will run, Alfred cannot run. The status of Hazel running is not specified directly, but we can infer from the other information that this statement is false because Alfred cannot run.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer:** 5. Lewis ate and no humans will run.",

We know every donkey kicked another donkey, but it doesn't imply that there is a specific donkey that was kicked by every other donkey. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every donkey kicked every donkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, the information does not support this claim.

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n\nThis is because the given condition that \"every monkey chased every donkey\" directly supports this statement.",

For every donkey, there exists at least one human who chased that donkey, and that same donkey chased that human back.\n\n3. **A monkey kicked a donkey that kicked a donkey.**\n   - This suggests a chain of events involving at least two donkeys and one monkey. The first donkey was kicked by the monkey, and then that same donkey kicked another donkey.\n\n4. **Every monkey kicked Lewis only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.**\n   - This indicates a conditional relationship regarding Lewis. If every monkey kicked Lewis, then it cannot be the case that all monkeys chased Lewis. Conversely, if all monkeys chased Lewis, then not every monkey could have kicked him.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the above analysis:\n\n1. **No donkeys chased a human.**\n   - This contradicts the second piece of information, which states that every donkey chased a human that chased it.

It only says that for every donkey, there is at least one human who chased it and was chased back. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **There is a donkey that every human chased.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, the information does not imply that there is a specific donkey chased by every human. Each donkey has at least one human who chased it, but not necessarily every human. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A donkey chased a human.**\n   - This aligns with the second piece of information, which states that every donkey chased a human that chased it.

There is at least one of each type.\n3. Hazel and Alfred are happy.\n4. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n5. Every monkey chased every human that chased every donkey.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel isn't happy.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that Hazel is happy. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred isn't a donkey.\n- If Alfred were a donkey, then \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" would mean that some donkeys did not chase Alfred. However, this does not provide enough information to conclude definitively that Alfred is not a donkey. We need more specific information about Alfred's type.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n- The condition \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is already given as true. However, Hazel being happy is independent of this condition based on the provided information. Thus, this statement does not necessarily follow from the given conditions.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred is a donkey.\n- Similar to Statement 2, we do not have enough information to conclude that Alfred is a donkey. The fact that not all donkeys chased Alfred does not imply Alfred's identity.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred isn't happy.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that Alfred is happy. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\n- This statement implies a conditional relationship between Hazel's happiness and whether any donkeys chased Alfred. Since Hazel is happy and it is stated that not all donkeys chased Alfred, this does not necessarily mean no donkeys chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement does not logically follow from the given conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the statements must be true based on the given information. Each statement either contradicts the given facts or introduces a conditional relationship without sufficient supporting evidence.\n\n**Final Answer:** None of the statements must be true.",

The given condition states that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, but it does not specify that there is a single monkey chased by all others. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"A monkey chased a monkey.\"\n- This is directly supported by the condition that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"A monkey chased every monkey.\"\n- This would mean there is a single monkey that chased all other monkeys. The given information does not support this; it only states that every monkey chased another monkey that chased it back, without specifying a single chaser for all. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"No monkeys chased a monkey.\"\n- This contradicts the given condition that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Every monkey chased every monkey.\"\n- This would imply a complete mutual chasing relationship among all monkeys, which is not stated or implied by the given information. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"No monkeys chased every monkey.\"\n- This means no single monkey chased all other monkeys. While the given information does not explicitly state this, it also does not contradict this statement. However, since we know that every monkey chased another monkey, it doesn't necessarily mean that no monkey chased every other monkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be conclusively determined as true based solely on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 2: A monkey chased a monkey.**\n\nThis is directly supported by the condition that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.",

If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey saw Lewis.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- This statement is about donkeys not chasing all monkeys. The given information does not provide any direct evidence about whether donkeys chased monkeys or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: A monkey chased a donkey.\n- According to the given information, \"Every monkey chased a donkey.\" This directly confirms that at least one monkey chased a donkey. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- The given information does not mention anything about donkeys chasing monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- Similar to Statement 3, the given information does not provide any details about donkeys chasing monkeys. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- Again, the given information does not provide any details about donkeys chasing monkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- The given information does not provide any details about donkeys chasing monkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true according to the given information is:\n\n**Statement 2: A monkey chased a donkey.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n4.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. Only humans are hungry.\n4. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n5. Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n6. It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n7. Alfred isn't a human unless no humans are hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Lewis is a donkey**: From point 6, \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey,\" we can infer that Lewis is indeed a donkey.\n- **Hazel doesn't see Hazel**: This statement is somewhat redundant as it just states that Hazel cannot see herself, which is trivially true.\n- **Alfred's status**: According to point 7, \"Alfred isn't a human unless no humans are hungry.\" Since only humans are hungry (point 3), if there were any hungry humans, Alfred would not be a human. However, since there is at least one human (point 2) and only humans are hungry, Alfred cannot be a human because there are hungry humans. Therefore, Alfred must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n- **Monkeys and kicking Lewis**: Point 4 states that not all monkeys kicked Lewis. This does not provide direct information about Alfred or Hazel's hunger status.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Lewis is hungry**: Since Lewis is a donkey and only humans are hungry, Lewis cannot be hungry.\n2. **Alfred is hungry**: Since Alfred cannot be a human (as established above), Alfred cannot be hungry.\n3. **Alfred isn't hungry**: Since Alfred cannot be a human, Alfred cannot be hungry, making this statement true.\n4. **Alfred and Hazel are hungry**: Since Alfred cannot be a human, Alfred cannot be hungry. The status of Hazel's hunger depends on whether Hazel is a human, but even if Hazel is a human, Alfred still cannot be hungry. Thus, this statement is false.\n5. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry**: Since neither Alfred nor Lewis (a donkey) can be hungry, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3.

Every monkey will run or Lewis is a donkey.\n4.

However, there is no direct information about whether all monkeys saw Hazel or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - We know from the given information that \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel,\" but there is no information about Hazel seeing herself. Additionally, we know that not all monkeys kicked Lewis, so this statement is false because it claims every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - The first part of this statement (\"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\") is true according to the given information. However, the second part contradicts the given information that \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" Thus, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - Both parts of this statement align with the given information: \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" and \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.**\n   - While \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is true, there is no information about Hazel seeing herself. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Hazel saw Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.**\n   - Similar to the previous analysis, while \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is true, there is no information about Hazel seeing herself.

The fact that Lewis saw every human does not imply anything about whether humans saw Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis saw a human.\n- Since it is stated that \"Lewis saw every human,\" and there is at least one human, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A human saw Lewis.\n- Similar to Statement 1, this cannot be determined directly from the given information. Just because Lewis saw every human doesn't mean any human saw Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all humans saw Lewis.\n- Again, this cannot be determined directly from the given information. We know Lewis saw every human, but we do not have information on whether humans saw Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred is a donkey.\n- There is no direct information provided about what Alfred is. However, since the problem states that everything is either a donkey, human, or monkey, and there is no specific exclusion for Alfred, it could be any of these. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every human saw Lewis.\n- This statement cannot be determined directly from the given information. We only know that Lewis saw every human, which does not provide information about whether every human saw Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that can be definitively concluded as true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 2: Lewis saw a human.**\n\nThis is because it is explicitly stated that \"Lewis saw every human,\" and there is at least one human.",

Since Alfred and Lewis are asleep, and Lewis is a donkey, it means at least one donkey (Lewis) is asleep.\n2. The condition \"If Alfred is asleep, then a donkey kicked Hazel\" is satisfied because Alfred is indeed asleep. This implies that a donkey did kick Hazel, but it doesn't specify who Hazel is or what she is.\n3. No humans will run, which means if anyone runs, they cannot be human.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Only donkeys are asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred and Lewis are asleep, and Lewis is a donkey. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that Alfred is also a donkey. Therefore, this statement might not be true.\n\n2. **No donkeys are asleep.**\n   - This is false because Lewis, who is a donkey, is asleep.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys are asleep.**\n   - We only know that Lewis is asleep, but we do not have information about other donkeys. Thus, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n4. **A donkey is asleep.**\n   - This is true because Lewis, who is a donkey, is asleep.\n\n5. **Every donkey is asleep.**\n   - We do not have information about all donkeys, so we cannot conclude that every donkey is asleep. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred will run.**\n   - It is stated that no humans will run. If Alfred were a human, he would not run. However, we do not know Alfred's type for sure, but since no humans will run, if Alfred is a human, he won't run. If Alfred is not a human, we still cannot conclude he will run based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4.

These two parts cannot both be true simultaneously. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys saw every human.\n- This directly contradicts the given condition that \"Every donkey saw every human.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a donkey that every human saw.\n- The given information does not provide any details about whether humans saw donkeys or not.

Since \"no humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel,\" and \"not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel,\" it follows that if every monkey chased Hazel, then no humans are hungry. However, it does not necessarily mean that only donkeys drank. Thus, this statement could be true but is not necessarily true based on the given information alone.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys drank just in case no humans are hungry.**\n   - From the given statements, \"not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel\" and \"no humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\" Therefore, \"not all donkeys drank\" is equivalent to \"no humans are hungry.\" This statement must be true.\n\n5. **Not all humans are hungry and every donkey drank.**\n   - There is no information that guarantees that every donkey drank.

The given conditions do not provide enough information to conclude this statement as necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis chased every human.\n- Similar to Statement 2, there is no information provided about Lewis chasing humans. Thus, we cannot conclude this statement as necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all humans chased Lewis.\n- From Interaction 2, \"A human chased Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis.\"\n- This implies that if any human chased Lewis, then not all humans chased Lewis.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true if any human chased Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every human chased Lewis.\n- This directly contradicts Statement 4. Since Statement 4 must be true if any human chased Lewis, Statement 5 cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No humans chased Lewis.\n- If no humans chased Lewis, then the condition \"A human chased Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis\" would not apply.\n- However, this does not contradict any given information, but it also doesn't have to be true based on the given conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 4: Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n\nThis conclusion follows from the conditional logic provided in Interaction 2.",

It only mentions that a monkey is hungry, but it doesn't specify which monkey or Hazel's hunger status. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel is hungry.\n\n2. **Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - The condition \"If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if Lewis is hungry\" suggests that if Lewis is seen by monkeys, he must be hungry. However, there is no direct information about whether Lewis was chased or seen by monkeys. Thus, we cannot definitively say Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a monkey.**\n   - Since every monkey saw Hazel, and it is stated that \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel,\" Hazel cannot be a monkey because a monkey would have seen itself, contradicting the given information. Therefore, Hazel cannot be a monkey.\n\n4. **Hazel is a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts the analysis for statement 3. Since Hazel cannot see herself, she cannot be a monkey. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Lewis and Hazel are hungry.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine the hunger status of both Lewis and Hazel. While a monkey is hungry, we cannot infer the hunger status of Lewis and Hazel from the given information.\n\n6. **Lewis is hungry.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, we do not have sufficient information to determine Lewis's hunger status. The condition involving Lewis being hungry is contingent upon specific actions (being chased by a human and seen by monkeys) that are not confirmed in the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. Hazel isn't a monkey.**\n\nThis conclusion is derived from the fact that if Hazel were a monkey, she would have seen herself, which contradicts the given information.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A monkey ate.\n3. No monkeys saw a monkey.\n4. Every human chased every human that chased it.\n5. Every human saw every monkey that saw every donkey.\n6. No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"There is a monkey that every monkey saw.\"\n- This statement cannot be true because according to the condition \"No monkeys saw a monkey,\" no monkey can see another monkey. Therefore, there cannot be a monkey that every monkey saw.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"A monkey saw every monkey.\"\n- This statement also cannot be true for the same reason as above. Since no monkey sees another monkey, it is impossible for a single monkey to see all other monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"A monkey saw a monkey.\"\n- This statement cannot be true either. The condition \"No monkeys saw a monkey\" directly contradicts this statement.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Every monkey saw every monkey.\"\n- This statement cannot be true for the same reason as the previous ones. If no monkey sees another monkey, then it is impossible for every monkey to see every other monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"A monkey saw every monkey that saw it.\"\n- This statement cannot be true. Since no monkey sees another monkey, there cannot be a scenario where a monkey sees another monkey that saw it.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Every monkey saw a monkey.\"\n- This statement cannot be true. Similar to the previous statements, since no monkey sees another monkey, it is impossible for every monkey to see a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the statements (1 through 6) must be true based on the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer:** None of the statements must be true.",

A human will attack and only donkeys are asleep.\n\nLet's analyze each condition and its implications:\n\n- **Condition 3**: \"No donkeys chased Lewis.\" This means that if an entity chased Lewis, it cannot be a donkey.\n- **Condition 4**: \"No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis.\" This can be rephrased as: If all humans chased Lewis, then some humans are asleep.\n- **Condition 5**: \"A human will attack and only donkeys are asleep.\" This implies that no humans are asleep because only donkeys are asleep.\n\nFrom Condition 5, we know that no humans are asleep.

However, we do not have information about whether any monkey is happy. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Every monkey kicked Lewis and a monkey is happy.**\n   - Condition 2 states that not all monkeys kicked Lewis, so this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is happy.**\n   - From condition 2, we know not all monkeys kicked Lewis. From condition 8, we know Lewis is not happy. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - We do not have direct information about whether Alfred will attack or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis is happy.**\n   - From condition 2, we know not all monkeys kicked Lewis. However, from condition 8, we know Lewis is not happy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis will attack.**\n   - We do not have direct information about whether Alfred will attack. Additionally, we know Lewis is not happy, but this does not necessarily mean he will or will not attack. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**3.

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. It is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel (which means Hazel sees Hazel).\n5. If Hazel kicked Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n6. Not all humans will run.\n7. Every donkey will run.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel doesn't see Hazel and a human will run.\n- This is false because we know Hazel sees Hazel (from point 4).\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel will run.\n- We cannot determine this directly from the given information. Hazel could be a donkey, human, or monkey, and the running condition varies by type.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel saw Hazel and a human will run.\n- This is partially true because Hazel saw Hazel (point 4). However, \"a human will run\" contradicts point 6 which states \"not all humans will run.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Hazel saw Hazel and no humans will run.\n- This is partially true because Hazel saw Hazel (point 4). However, \"no humans will run\" contradicts point 6 which states \"not all humans will run,\" meaning some humans might run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Hazel saw Hazel and only humans will run.\n- This is false because \"only humans will run\" contradicts point 6 which states \"not all humans will run.\" Additionally, every donkey will run (point 7), so it's not just humans who will run.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run.\n- This is true because Hazel saw Hazel (point 4) and it aligns with point 6 which states \"not all humans will run.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run.**",

Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n6. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - Given: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n   - This means that it is impossible for any donkey to have kicked Hazel, which implies that not all donkeys kicked Hazel (since none did). Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Hazel kicked every donkey.**\n   - The information provided does not give us any details about Hazel kicking donkeys. It only tells us what donkeys did not do (kick Hazel) and what Lewis did not do (see Hazel). Thus, we cannot conclude whether Hazel kicked every donkey or not from the given information. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - Given: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n   - This directly contradicts the statement. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n4. **Hazel kicked a donkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, the information provided does not give us any details about Hazel kicking donkeys. We cannot conclude whether Hazel kicked a donkey or not from the given information. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - Given: \"Alfred is asleep only if every monkey saw Lewis.\"\n   - This conditional statement tells us that for Alfred to be asleep, every monkey must have seen Lewis. However, we do not have information about whether every monkey saw Lewis or not. Therefore, we cannot determine if Alfred is asleep or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - Given: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n   - This directly contradicts the statement.

Every human is asleep if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.\n5. Alfred isn't asleep.\n6. Hazel is not a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since Alfred isn't asleep, we know Alfred is awake.\n- Hazel is not a monkey, so Hazel can either be a human or a donkey.\n- Lewis doesn't see Hazel, which means Hazel could be a donkey (since donkeys aren't mentioned as seeing anyone) or a human who wasn't seen by Lewis.\n- Every monkey saw Alfred, so if Hazel were a monkey, she would have seen Alfred, contradicting the fact that Hazel is not a monkey.\n- For every human to be asleep, not all humans must have seen Hazel. Since Alfred is awake, he cannot be a human (because if he were, the condition for humans being asleep wouldn't hold).\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - True: Alfred isn't asleep (given). Lewis doesn't see Hazel (given).\n   \n2. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - False: Alfred isn't asleep (given).\n\n3. **Alfred isn't asleep but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - False: Alfred isn't asleep (given), but Lewis indeed doesn't see Hazel (given).\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n   - False: Alfred isn't asleep (given).\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n   - False: Alfred isn't asleep (given).\n\n6. **Lewis is asleep.**\n   - Cannot be determined from the given information.

Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, Hazel cannot attack.\n\n2. **Hazel will attack only if a donkey kicked Hazel**: This reinforces the previous point. Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, Hazel will not attack.\n\n3. **If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel**:\n   - This statement is conditional on Hazel being hungry.\n   - It states that if Hazel is hungry, then for it to be true that not all donkeys kicked Alfred, it must also be true that no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - However, since we already know Hazel will not attack (because no donkeys kicked her), whether Hazel is hungry or not does not affect the outcome of Hazel attacking.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the provided statements:\n\n1. **Alfred will attack**: The information given does not provide any direct conditions under which Alfred will attack. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will attack based on the given information.\n\n2. **Alfred won't attack**: Similar to the first statement, there is no information about Alfred's behavior regarding attacking. We cannot definitively say Alfred won't attack either.\n\n3. **Hazel won't attack**: This is true based on the given information. Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, she will not attack.\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel will attack**: This is false because Hazel will not attack, as established above.\n\n5. **Hazel will attack**: This is false because no donkeys kicked Hazel, so she will not attack.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3.

If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey chased Hazel only if not all donkeys will run.\n5. Not all humans will run.\n6.

However, this statement does imply that there is a conditional relationship between monkeys chasing Hazel and donkeys running.\n- **Not all humans will run**: This means there is at least one human who will not run.\n- **Hazel isn't asleep**: This doesn't directly affect the logical relationships but provides additional context.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Alfred chased a human**: False.

No humans ate just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n5. No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.\n6. Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy.\n\nLet's analyze each condition:\n\n- **Condition 2**: Not all humans chased Lewis. This means there exists at least one human who did not chase Lewis.\n- **Condition 3**: A human saw Alfred just in case every human chased Hazel. This implies that if any human saw Alfred, then every human must have chased Hazel. Conversely, if not every human chased Hazel, no human saw Alfred.\n- **Condition 4**: No humans ate just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred. This means if no humans ate, then not all donkeys chased Alfred. The contrapositive is: If all donkeys chased Alfred, then some humans ate.\n- **Condition 5**: No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if not all humans saw Hazel. This means:\n  - If no donkeys chased Alfred, then not all humans saw Hazel.\n  - If not all humans saw Hazel, then no donkeys chased Alfred.\n- **Condition 6**: Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy. This means:\n  - Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n  - Lewis is happy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **A human ate**:\n   - From Condition 4, if all donkeys chased Alfred, then some humans ate. However, from Condition 6, we know not all donkeys chased Alfred. Therefore, we cannot conclude that a human ate based on the given conditions alone.\n\n2. **No humans ate**:\n   - From Condition 4, if no humans ate, then not all donkeys chased Alfred. Since we know from Condition 6 that not all donkeys chased Alfred, it is possible that no humans ate. However, this does not necessarily mean it must be true.\n\n3. **Every human ate**:\n   - There is no direct information indicating that every human ate. We can only infer that some humans might have eaten under certain conditions, but not necessarily all.\n\n4. **Only humans ate**:\n   - There is no information about whether donkeys or monkeys ate. Thus, we cannot conclude that only humans ate.\n\n5. **Alfred ate**:\n   - There is no information provided about what Alfred did or did not eat.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis ate**:\n   - There is no information provided about what Alfred and Lewis did or did not eat.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the statements must be true given the provided conditions.

Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n3. **Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - This statement has two parts:\n     - \"Only donkeys drank\" implies that if something drank, it must be a donkey.\n     - \"or every donkey kicked Lewis\" implies that if not all donkeys drank, then every donkey must have kicked Lewis.\n   - Since we know from point 2 that Lewis is not a donkey, the second part (\"every donkey kicked Lewis\") must be false. Thus, the first part (\"only donkeys drank\") must be true. Therefore, if anything drank, it must be a donkey.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.**\n   - This is a conditional statement: If Lewis did not chase himself, then no donkeys chased Alfred.\n   - Since Lewis cannot chase himself (as he is not a donkey), the condition \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is always true. Therefore, no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the provided statements:\n\n1. **Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - True, as established from point 2.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred drank. However, since Lewis is not a donkey, he could not have drunk according to point 3. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - False, as established from point 2.\n\n4. **Alfred drank.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred drank.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all humans are hungry.\n3. Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n4. If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel is hungry.\n5. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n6. Alfred isn't hungry.\n7. Lewis isn't happy.\n8. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n9. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Not all humans are hungry**: This means there is at least one human who is not hungry.\n- **Alfred didn't chase Alfred**: This is a tautology and doesn't provide new information about Alfred's nature.\n- **If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel is hungry**:\n  - This implies that if some humans are awake, for a human to have chased Lewis, Hazel must be hungry.\n- **If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if no humans are hungry**:\n  - This implies that if Lewis didn't chase himself (which is always true), for a human to have chased Hazel, no humans can be hungry.\n- **Alfred isn't hungry**: This tells us Alfred is not among those who are hungry.\n- **Lewis isn't happy**: This doesn't directly affect the logical structure but might be useful in other contexts.\n- **Every monkey chased Alfred**: This suggests that if Alfred were a monkey, he would have chased himself, which contradicts the fact that Alfred didn't chase Alfred. Therefore, Alfred cannot be a monkey.\n- **Lewis doesn't see Hazel**: This doesn't directly impact the logical structure but might be relevant in other contexts.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis, we can conclude:\n- Alfred cannot be a monkey because every monkey chased Alfred, and Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- Alfred isn't hungry, but this alone doesn't determine his state of being asleep or awake.\n\nGiven these points, the statement that must be true is:\n- **Alfred isn't a monkey**.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n**3.

It is not possible for no humans to have seen Hazel if Hazel saw every human. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, we do not have enough information to conclude that not all humans saw Hazel. We only know that Hazel saw every human, which does not provide information about whether every human saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.**\n   - This statement involves a conditional relationship. However, without additional information about Hazel's identity or who specifically saw Hazel, we cannot definitively determine the truth of this statement. Therefore, it is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A human saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel saw every human, it implies that Hazel is not a human (because a human cannot see themselves). Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey. Given that there is at least one human, and Hazel saw every human, it follows that at least one human saw Hazel (since Hazel saw them). Thus, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a human.**\n   - This statement is directly supported by the given information that Hazel saw every human. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **5. A human saw Hazel.**\n- **6. Hazel saw a human.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 5 and 6 must be true.",

If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 2 and 3, since Hazel kicked a donkey and no humans kicked a donkey, Hazel cannot be a human. Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n- Point 4 involves conditional logic about Alfred attacking and donkeys kicking Hazel, which we need to consider carefully.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a contradiction because it states that Hazel being non-human implies she is human, which is logically impossible. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Hazel is a human.**\n   - We already determined that Hazel cannot be a human because she kicked a donkey, and no humans did so. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - The condition \"If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel\" does not provide enough information to definitively conclude whether Alfred will attack or not. It depends on additional conditions not specified here. Therefore, we cannot determine this with certainty.\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel will attack.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, we do not have sufficient information to conclude that both Alfred and Hazel will attack. Hazel's status as a potential attacker is not addressed directly, and Alfred's attacking behavior is uncertain.\n\n5. **Hazel isn't a human.**\n   - As previously deduced, Hazel cannot be a human because she kicked a donkey, and no humans did so. This statement is true.\n\n6. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is another contradictory statement similar to statement 1. It suggests that if Hazel is not a human, then she must be a human, which is logically impossible.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\n4. A monkey chased a monkey that chased a monkey.\n5. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that for every monkey, there exists at least one donkey that has kicked it.\n- The condition \"Every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it\" does not imply that every donkey kicks every monkey. It only implies that for each monkey, there is some donkey that was kicked by that monkey and subsequently kicked back.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that a donkey kicked every monkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every donkey kicked a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that each donkey has kicked at least one monkey.\n- The given conditions do not provide enough information to confirm that every donkey has indeed kicked a monkey. We only know about the interactions between monkeys and donkeys, but not necessarily that every donkey has participated in such an interaction.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that every donkey kicked a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that there is no single donkey that has kicked all the monkeys.\n- Since we do not have specific information about the number of donkeys or their interactions with all monkeys, we cannot definitively say whether any donkey has kicked all monkeys or not.\n- However, given the lack of evidence supporting the contrary, this statement seems plausible but not conclusively proven.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that each donkey has kicked every single monkey.\n- Similar to Statement 2, the given conditions do not provide enough information to support this claim.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that every donkey kicked every monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey kicked a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that at least one donkey has kicked at least one monkey.\n- From the condition \"Every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it,\" we can infer that there must be at least one instance where a donkey has been kicked by a monkey and subsequently kicked back.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that no donkey has ever kicked a monkey.\n- This directly contradicts the condition \"Every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it,\" which implies that there must be at least one instance of a donkey kicking a monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Therefore, we cannot conclude from the given information that not all donkeys chased Hazel. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Hazel chased a donkey.**\n   - The information clearly states that Hazel chased every donkey.

This statement must be true.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased Hazel.**\n   - The information does not provide any details about whether every donkey chased Hazel. It only mentions that Hazel chased every donkey. Thus, we cannot conclude that every donkey chased Hazel.

We can't conclude that at least one donkey chased Hazel.

This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Hazel is hungry.**\n   - According to the conditional statement: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is hungry.\" Since it is given that not all donkeys saw Hazel, for the condition to hold, if every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel must be hungry. However, the problem does not state that every monkey chased Hazel; it only provides a conditional relationship. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Hazel is hungry based solely on the given information.

So, for every donkey \\( D \\), \\( D \\) kicked \\( H_0 \\).\n\n3. **Every human chased every donkey that chased every donkey.**\n   - This implies that if a donkey \\( D_1 \\) chased another donkey \\( D_2 \\), then every human \\( H \\) chased \\( D_1 \\).\n\n4. **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - This tells us that no donkey saw Lewis, and Lewis saw Alfred. Since Lewis is not specified as a donkey, he could be a human or a monkey.\n\n5. **Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.**\n   - This means if any donkey saw Hazel, then Lewis must have chased himself. However, since it's impossible for someone to chase themselves, this condition is always false. Therefore, no donkey saw Hazel.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a monkey ate.**\n   - This means if no donkeys chased Alfred, then a monkey ate, and vice versa.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - We know that every donkey kicked \\( H_0 \\), but we do not have information about other humans being kicked by every donkey. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A donkey kicked every human.**\n   - We know that every donkey kicked \\( H_0 \\), but we do not have information about other humans being kicked by at least one donkey. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n   - Since every donkey kicked \\( H_0 \\), this statement is true.\n\n4. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it implies that all humans are asleep if and only if not all humans are asleep, which cannot be true simultaneously. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n5. **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n   - We know that every donkey kicked \\( H_0 \\), so this statement is false.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked a human.**\n   - We know that every donkey kicked \\( H_0 \\), so this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. Every donkey kicked a human.**\n\nFinal Answer: 3. Every donkey kicked a human.",

It depends on the specific number and interactions among the donkeys.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey saw a donkey.\n- This must be true. Since every donkey saw every donkey that saw it, and there is at least one donkey, each donkey must have seen at least one other donkey (including itself).\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey saw every donkey.\n- This cannot be determined directly from the given information.

Everything is exclusively a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Not all donkeys saw Alfred.\n4. Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\n5. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every donkey.\n- This means for every donkey \\(D\\), there exists another donkey \\(D'\\) such that \\(D'\\) kicked \\(D\\).\n- The condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it\" does not necessarily imply that every donkey was kicked by some other donkey. It only states that if a donkey \\(D\\) was kicked by another donkey \\(D'\\), then \\(D\\) also kicked \\(D'\\). Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys kicked a donkey.\n- This would mean no donkey ever kicked another donkey.\n- However, the condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it\" implies that if a donkey \\(D\\) was kicked by another donkey \\(D'\\), then \\(D\\) also kicked \\(D'\\). Thus, this statement contradicts the given condition and cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every donkey.\n- This means for every pair of donkeys \\(D\\) and \\(D'\\), \\(D\\) kicked \\(D'\\) and \\(D'\\) kicked \\(D\\).\n- The given condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it\" does not imply that every donkey kicked every other donkey. It only implies mutual kicking between pairs where one initially kicked the other. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.\n- This means there exists a specific donkey \\(D\\) such that every other donkey \\(D'\\) kicked \\(D\\).\n- The given condition does not provide enough information to conclude that there is such a donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey kicked a donkey.\n- This means there exists at least one pair of donkeys \\(D\\) and \\(D'\\) such that \\(D\\) kicked \\(D'\\).\n- The condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it\" implies that if a donkey \\(D\\) was kicked by another donkey \\(D'\\), then \\(D\\) also kicked \\(D'\\). Since there are donkeys, and the condition involves mutual kicking, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every donkey.\n- This means there is no donkey \\(D\\) such that \\(D\\) kicked every other donkey.\n- The given condition does not provide enough information to conclude that no donkey kicked every other donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey kicked a donkey.**\n\nThis is because the condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it\" implies that there must be at least one instance of a donkey kicking another donkey.",

Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - As established, Alfred did not drink. Additionally, we do not have any information about Hazel drinking. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - Again, Alfred did not drink. We also do not have specific information about Lewis drinking.

It only states that a monkey chased Alfred and every human chased Alfred. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred chased every human based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred chased a human.\n- There is no information indicating that Alfred chased anyone. The only information about Alfred is that he was chased by a monkey and every human. Thus, we cannot conclude that Alfred chased a human.\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans chased Alfred.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that every human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: A human chased Alfred.\n- This is consistent with the given information that every human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all humans chased Alfred.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that every human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred will run.\n- There is no information provided about whether Alfred will run or not.

Only donkeys can potentially attack, and the condition for no attacks is met when a human is asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A human is happy just in case a human is asleep.**\n   - This is true based on the given conditions. If a human is asleep, no donkeys will attack, making the human happy. Conversely, if a human is happy, it implies no donkeys are attacking, which means a human must be asleep.\n\n3. **A human is happy just in case every human is asleep.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The happiness of a human depends on whether no donkeys will attack, which is guaranteed if at least one human is asleep, not necessarily every human.\n\n4. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - This cannot be true for the same reason as statement 1. Alfred cannot attack if he is a human or a monkey.\n\n5. **Alfred won't attack.**\n   - This is true. Given the conditions, Alfred, being asleep, cannot be a donkey who attacks. Thus, Alfred won't attack.\n\n6. **A human is happy just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This is false. A human can be happy even if all humans are asleep, as long as no donkeys attack, which is guaranteed by at least one human being asleep.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 2: A human is happy just in case a human is asleep.\n- Statement 5: Alfred won't attack.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 2 and 5 must be true.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys saw a donkey.\n3. Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey kicked Hazel.\n4. If no humans chased Hazel, then not all humans chased Lewis.\n5. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if every human saw Hazel.\n6. Hazel saw Hazel and every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Hazel saw Hazel**: This means Hazel cannot be a donkey because no donkeys saw a donkey. Therefore, Hazel must be either a human or a monkey.\n- **Every monkey chased Alfred**: This implies that if Hazel is a monkey, she chased Alfred. However, if Hazel is a human, this does not affect her status directly.\n\n#### Considering Hazel:\n- Since Hazel saw herself, she cannot be a donkey. Thus, Hazel must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Considering Lewis:\n- \"Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey kicked Hazel\": If Hazel is a monkey and she kicked herself (or was kicked by another monkey), then Lewis would not be a donkey. Otherwise, Lewis is a donkey.\n- \"If no humans chased Hazel, then not all humans chased Lewis\": This statement provides conditional information about the chasing behavior of humans towards Hazel and Lewis.\n- \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if every human saw Hazel\": Since every monkey chased Alfred, we need to consider whether this affects Lewis being a donkey based on whether every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the constraints:\n- Hazel cannot be a donkey because she saw herself.\n- If Hazel is a monkey, she chased Alfred, and if she kicked herself, Lewis would not be a donkey.\n- If Hazel is a human, she did not kick herself, so Lewis would be a donkey.\n\nSince Hazel cannot be a donkey, the correct statement among the options provided is:\n\n**3.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n4. It is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n5. Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if Hazel is a human.\n6. A human saw Lewis.\n7. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if Hazel is a human.\n- This means if Alfred sees Alfred, then Hazel can be anything. However, if Alfred does not see Alfred, then Hazel must be a human.\n\n#### Statement 4: A human saw Lewis.\n- This implies that Lewis could be seen by a human, but it doesn't specify what Lewis is.\n\n#### Statement 7: Every monkey chased Alfred.\n- If Alfred were a monkey, no monkey would chase Alfred because Alfred would be included in \"every monkey.\" Therefore, Alfred cannot be a monkey.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n- **Alfred isn't a monkey** (Statement 1 is true).\n\nSince Alfred isn't a monkey, he must either be a human or a donkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- Since Alfred didn't chase Alfred, Alfred cannot be a monkey (already established) and also cannot be a donkey because donkeys do not chase themselves. Thus, Alfred must be a human.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n- **Alfred is a human** (Statement 6 is true).\n\nGiven that Alfred is a human:\n- The statement \"A human saw Lewis\" now tells us that Lewis could be anything, but since Alfred is a human who saw Lewis, Lewis could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n1. Alfred isn't a monkey.\n6. Alfred is a human.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n- Statements 1 and 6 must be true.",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey will run unless not all donkeys will attack.\n3. Not all donkeys will attack or no donkeys are happy.\n4. No donkeys are happy unless every donkey will attack.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Condition 2:** \"Every monkey will run unless not all donkeys will attack.\"\n  - This means that if all donkeys will attack, then every monkey will run. If not all donkeys will attack, then it doesn't specify what happens to the monkeys, but we can infer that they might not necessarily run.\n\n- **Condition 3:** \"Not all donkeys will attack or no donkeys are happy.\"\n  - This condition states that either not all donkeys will attack, or no donkeys are happy. It cannot be both that all donkeys will attack and some donkeys are happy.\n\n- **Condition 4:** \"No donkeys are happy unless every donkey will attack.\"\n  - This means that for any donkey to be happy, every donkey must attack. If even one donkey does not attack, no donkey can be happy.\n\n### Combining Conditions:\nFrom Condition 4, we know that if any donkey does not attack, no donkey can be happy. Therefore, for any donkey to be happy, every donkey must attack.\n\nHowever, from Condition 3, we know that if every donkey attacks, then no donkeys can be happy because it would contradict the condition that \"not all donkeys will attack or no donkeys are happy.\" Since \"every donkey will attack\" implies \"all donkeys will attack,\" which contradicts the first part of Condition 3, it follows that no donkeys can be happy.\n\nThus, combining these insights, we conclude:\n- No donkeys are happy.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**1. No donkeys are happy.**\n\nThis is the only statement among the options provided that logically follows from the given conditions.",

Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will run based solely on the given information.\n\n2. **No donkeys are happy.**\n   - We know that every donkey will run (from point 5). According to point 3, if every donkey will run, then it must be the case that every donkey is happy. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Every donkey is happy.**\n   - Since every donkey will run (point 5) and according to point 3, if every donkey will run, then every donkey must be happy. This statement is true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys are happy.**\n   - Contradicts the conclusion from statement 3. Since every donkey is happy, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys are happy and every donkey will run.**\n   - This statement is contradictory because we concluded that every donkey is happy (statement 3). Hence, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Only donkeys are happy.**\n   - We do not have information about the happiness of humans or monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude that only donkeys are happy.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. Every donkey is happy.**\n\nFinal Answer: **3.

For example, if Human A saw Human B, then Human B must have seen Human A, but it doesn't mean Human C necessarily saw both A and B. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A human saw a human.**\n   - Since there is at least one human and every human saw every human that saw it, it implies that at least one human saw another human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Every human saw a human.**\n   - Given that every human saw every human that saw it, it means that for any human, there exists at least one human they saw. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **A human saw every human.**\n   - The problem does not provide enough information to conclude that there is a single human who saw every other human. It only states that every human saw every human that saw it, which does not imply that one human saw all others. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No humans saw every human.**\n   - This statement contradicts the possibility that a human could see every other human. Since we cannot definitively rule out the existence of such a human based on the given information, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nIn conclusion, the statements that must be true are:\n1.

Not all humans are asleep.\n2. A human chased Lewis only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n\nThe second part implies that if a human chased Lewis, then Lewis did not chase himself. However, since Lewis cannot chase himself (as it would be logically impossible for someone to chase themselves), this condition is always true regardless of whether a human chased Lewis or not.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the given information:\n\n1. **Lewis and Alfred ate.**\n   - We know Lewis ate, but there is no information about whether Alfred ate.

However, we only know that not all donkeys kicked Alfred, which does not imply that none did.\n   - Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n2. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - We know that only humans are hungry, but we have no specific information about whether Alfred is a human or what his hunger status is.\n   - This statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Alfred isn't hungry.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, we do not have enough information to determine Alfred's hunger status.\n   - This statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked Alfred unless no humans are hungry.**\n   - We know that not all donkeys kicked Alfred, but we do not know if any did.\n   - We also know that only humans are hungry, meaning there are hungry humans.\n   - The condition \"unless no humans are hungry\" is false because there are hungry humans.\n   - Therefore, the statement \"no donkeys kicked Alfred\" must be true for the conditional to hold.\n   - However, since we only know that not all donkeys kicked Alfred, we cannot conclude that no donkeys kicked Alfred.\n   - Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n5. **Only humans are hungry and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.**\n   - We know that only humans are hungry.\n   - We also know that not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n   - Both parts of this statement are true based on the given information.\n   - Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - We know that only humans are hungry, but we do not have information about whether Alfred and Lewis are humans.\n   - This statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A human will run.\n3. A human is happy and Lewis didn't chase Hazel.\n4. A donkey kicked Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\n5. If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n6. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Lewis won't run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred won't run.\n- There is no direct information about whether Alfred runs or not. The information provided does not give us enough details to conclude that Alfred won't run. Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Hazel will run.\n- We know from point 2 that a human will run, but it doesn't specify which human(s) will run. There is no specific information about Hazel running. Thus, we cannot conclude that both Alfred and Hazel will run based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred will run.\n- Similar to Statement 1, there is no direct information about whether Alfred runs or not. Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- From point 2, we know that a human will run. However, it does not specify which human(s) will run. There is no specific information about Lewis running. Therefore, we cannot conclude that both Alfred and Lewis will run based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human is happy and a human will run.\n- This statement combines two pieces of information directly given in points 2 and 3. Point 2 states that a human will run, and point 3 states that a human is happy. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every human is happy and a human will run.\n- While we know from point 3 that a human is happy, it does not imply that every human is happy. Therefore, we cannot conclude that every human is happy. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: A human is happy and a human will run.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

A human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.\n4. Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(D\\) for \"donkey\"\n- \\(H\\) for \"human\"\n- \\(M\\) for \"monkey\"\n- \\(A(x)\\) for \"x is asleep\"\n- \\(C(x, y)\\) for \"x chased y\"\n\nFrom the given conditions:\n- \\(A(H) \\leftrightarrow \\forall H' C(H', Hazel)\\)\n- \\(\\forall M C(M, Hazel) \\leftrightarrow \\forall H C(H, Hazel)\\)\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This would mean \\(A(H) \\leftrightarrow \\forall M C(M, Hazel)\\).\n   - From the given conditions, we know \\(A(H) \\leftrightarrow \\forall H' C(H', Hazel)\\) and \\(\\forall M C(M, Hazel) \\leftrightarrow \\forall H C(H, Hazel)\\).

Thus, \\(\\neg \\forall H A(H)\\) means \\(\\exists H \\neg A(H)\\), which implies \\(\\exists H \\neg C(H, Hazel)\\). Therefore, \\(\\neg \\forall H A(H) \\rightarrow \\neg \\forall M C(M, Hazel)\\). The reverse implication does not necessarily hold without additional information.\n\n5. **Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This translates to: \\(\\forall H A(H) \\leftrightarrow \\forall M C(M, Hazel)\\).\n   - Given \\(\\forall H A(H) \\leftrightarrow \\forall H' C(H', Hazel)\\) and \\(\\forall M C(M, Hazel) \\leftrightarrow \\forall H C(H, Hazel)\\), this statement is true.\n\n6. **If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - This translates to: \\(\\forall H A(H) \\rightarrow (\\forall M C(M, Hazel) \\rightarrow \\neg C(Hazel, Hazel))\\).\n   - There is no direct information about Hazel chasing herself, so this cannot be concluded from the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer:** Statements 1 and 5 must be true in this situation.",

The conditional statement involves running only for donkeys, not humans or monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n- Since Alfred is a human (as he is not a donkey or monkey based on the classification rule), it makes sense that Alfred didn't chase himself (a human cannot chase themselves). Also, it is stated that a monkey kicked Alfred. This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred will run.\n- There is no information provided about whether Alfred will run. The conditional statement does not provide enough information to determine this.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred won't run.\n- Similar to Statement 3, there is no information provided about whether Alfred will run or not. Thus, we cannot conclude this either.\n\n#### Statement 5: A monkey chased Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n- It is stated that every monkey chased Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred. This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel will run.\n- Hazel is a monkey, and there is no information about whether monkeys will run. Similarly, as discussed earlier, there is no information about whether Alfred will run. Therefore, we cannot conclude this.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n\n- **Statement 2**: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n- **Statement 5**: A monkey chased Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\nThus, the final answer is that **Statements 2 and 5** must be true.",

However, since it's stated that Lewis isn't a donkey, it follows that some donkeys must have kicked Alfred.\n\n6. **A monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is a human.**\n   - This means if a monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel must be a human.\n\n7. **If a human chased Lewis, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This is a complex conditional statement.

It does not specify whether different humans chased different donkeys or the same human chased all donkeys.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - There is at least one donkey that did not see Hazel.\n   - Hazel did not chase Alfred. Since Alfred could be a donkey, human, or monkey, this statement doesn't provide much direct information about chasing behavior among these categories.\n\n4. **A human kicked Lewis or every human saw Hazel.**\n   - Either some human kicked Lewis, or every human saw Hazel. This statement does not directly impact the chasing behavior between donkeys and humans.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys will attack or a monkey will attack.**\n   - This statement is about attacking behavior, which is not directly related to chasing behavior.\n\n6. **A human saw Alfred if and only if not all donkeys ate.**\n   - This statement links seeing Alfred with eating behavior among donkeys, which again does not directly affect chasing behavior.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - The information does not support this. We know humans chased donkeys, but not necessarily vice versa.\n\n2. **A donkey chased a human.**\n   - The information does not support this either. We do not have any specific information indicating that any donkey chased a human.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased every human.**\n   - Again, the information does not support this. We lack evidence that donkeys chased humans at all.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - Similar to the previous points, we do not have information supporting or refuting this statement.\n\n5. **A human chased a donkey.**\n   - This is supported by the information \"A human chased every donkey.\" Therefore, it must be true that at least one human chased at least one donkey.\n\n6. **A donkey chased every human.**\n   - The information does not support this. We do not have any indication that donkeys chased humans.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**5. A human chased a donkey.**",

Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n6. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.\"\n- This statement involves a biconditional (\"if and only if\") relationship between two conditions: Hazel not being a human and a human seeing Hazel.\n- If Hazel is not a human, then a human must have seen Hazel. Conversely, if a human saw Hazel, then Hazel cannot be a human.\n- The condition \"Every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred\" suggests that either all humans saw Hazel or all donkeys chased Alfred. Since not all donkeys chased Alfred, it implies that every human saw Hazel.\n- Therefore, if Hazel were a human, every human would see Hazel, which contradicts the biconditional requirement. Thus, Hazel must not be a human for the statement to hold true.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Hazel saw a human.\"\n- There is no direct information about Hazel seeing a human. The given conditions do not provide enough information to confirm this.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Every human saw Hazel.\"\n- From the condition \"Every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred,\" and knowing that not all donkeys chased Alfred, it follows that every human must have seen Hazel.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"No humans saw Hazel.\"\n- This directly contradicts Statement 3, which we concluded must be true.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Hazel saw every human.\"\n- There is no information indicating that Hazel saw every human. The given conditions do not support this claim.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Not all humans saw Hazel.\"\n- This statement contradicts Statement 3, which we concluded must be true.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement cannot be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1. Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.\n3. Every human saw Hazel.",

Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5. **Not all monkeys drank.**\n   - This also contradicts statement 4, which says every monkey drank. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n6. **Only monkeys drank.**\n   - We know from statement 4 that every monkey drank. However, there is no information indicating that no other animals (humans or donkeys) drank. Thus, we cannot conclude that only monkeys drank.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3. A monkey drank.**",

It only states that every human chased Alfred, which doesn't imply Alfred chased a human. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No humans chased Alfred.\n- This directly contradicts the given condition \"Every human chased Alfred.\" Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all humans chased Alfred.\n- This also contradicts the given condition \"Every human chased Alfred.\" If every human chased Alfred, then it cannot be true that not all humans chased Alfred. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred chased every human.\n- There is no information provided that indicates Alfred chased every human. The given information only tells us that every human chased Alfred, not vice versa. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human chased Alfred.\n- This is consistent with the given condition \"Every human chased Alfred.\" Since every human chased Alfred, it must be true that at least one human chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred is a human.\n- The given information does not specify what type of being Alfred is. However, since every human chased Alfred, and Alfred is involved in actions (chasing, kicking), it is reasonable to infer that Alfred could be a human. But without explicit information, we cannot definitively conclude this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: A human chased Alfred.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Since seeing oneself doesn't provide additional information about the relationships between different types, we can move on to the other conditions.\n\nNext, consider \"A donkey saw every monkey.\" This means that for every monkey, there exists at least one donkey that saw it. However, this does not imply anything about the chasing behavior directly.\n\nThe key condition is \"Every donkey chased every human that chased it.\" This means that if a human chases a donkey, then that donkey will chase back that human.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A donkey chased a human.**\n   - This statement might be true if there was a human who chased a donkey, which would make the donkey chase that human back. However, without knowing if any human chased a donkey, we cannot definitively say this must be true.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased every human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the condition only states that a donkey will chase a human if that human chased it first. It does not imply that every donkey will chase every human regardless of whether they were chased.\n\n3. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - This statement is also not necessarily true. If a human chased a donkey, then that donkey would chase that human back. But it does not rule out the possibility that some donkeys might chase all humans if those humans chased them.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, this might be true if every human chased a donkey, but we do not have enough information to confirm this must happen.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true for the same reason as statement 2. The condition only applies if a human chased a donkey first.\n\n6. **A donkey chased every human that chased it.**\n   - This statement must be true according to the given condition: \"Every donkey chased every human that chased it.\"\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**Final Answer: 6.

Therefore, this statement also cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred and every donkey will run.**\n   - While it is true that \"not all donkeys chased Alfred,\" the part stating \"every donkey will run\" contradicts the given information that \"not all donkeys will run.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 2. Not all donkeys chased Alfred and not all donkeys will run.**",

However, the condition \"Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey\" does not imply that every human was chased by a donkey. It only implies that if a human chased a donkey, then every donkey chased that human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - This statement suggests that each donkey chased at least one human. The condition \"Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey\" does not guarantee that every donkey chased a human unless a human chased a donkey first. Since we do not have information about whether every donkey was chased by a human, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No humans chased every donkey.**\n   - This statement suggests that no single human chased all donkeys. Given the condition \"No donkeys chased a human that chased it,\" if a human chased a donkey, then that donkey did not chase that human back. This does not provide enough information to conclude that no human chased every donkey. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true from the given information.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased a human.**\n   - This statement suggests that no donkey chased any human. However, the condition \"Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey\" implies that if a human chased a donkey, then every donkey chased that human. Therefore, this statement contradicts the given conditions and cannot be true.\n\n5. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - This statement suggests that no donkey chased all humans. The condition \"Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey\" does not imply that every donkey chased every human. It only states that if a human chased a donkey, then every donkey chased that human. Therefore, this statement is consistent with the given conditions and can be true.\n\n6. **Every donkey chased every human.**\n   - This statement suggests that each donkey chased every human. The condition \"Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey\" does not imply that every donkey chased every human unless a human chased a donkey first. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5. No donkeys chased every human.**",

The condition \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it\" does not necessarily imply that there is a single monkey seen by all others. It could mean a circular pattern where each monkey sees another, but not necessarily the same one. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No monkeys saw every monkey.**\n   - This statement contradicts the idea that every monkey saw a monkey that saw it. If every monkey saw a monkey that saw it, it implies some form of mutual visibility among monkeys, which means at least some monkeys saw every other monkey. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Every monkey saw every monkey.**\n   - This statement is stronger than the given condition. The condition only states that every monkey saw a monkey that saw it, not necessarily every other monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A monkey saw every monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, this statement is not directly supported by the given condition. The condition does not specify that there is a single monkey who saw all others. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A monkey saw a monkey.**\n   - This statement is directly supported by the condition \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\" Since every monkey saw a monkey, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No monkeys saw a monkey.**\n   - This statement directly contradicts the given condition \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**5.

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given information that \"every monkey saw Alfred.\" Thus, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Alfred ate.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Alfred ate or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred ate.\n\n6. **Alfred saw a monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, the information does not provide any direct evidence that Alfred saw a monkey. It only states that every monkey saw Alfred. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred saw a monkey.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. A monkey saw Alfred.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 3 must be true.",

Thus, it is possible that no human chased every monkey, but we cannot conclude this as a necessity based on the given information alone.\n\n3. **A human chased every monkey.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, the information does not provide enough detail to confirm that at least one human chased every single monkey.

In other words, if Donkey A sees Donkey B, then Donkey B cannot see Donkey A.\n\n3. **A human is happy and Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - There is at least one happy human.\n   - Lewis saw Alfred.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys will run.**\n   - At least one donkey will not run.\n\n5. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - Lewis is identified as a donkey.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement based on the above information:\n\n1. **Lewis will run.**\n   - We know that not all donkeys will run, so it is possible that Lewis will run, but it is not necessarily true that he will run. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n2. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Alfred will run or not. Since Alfred could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there is no specific information about his running behavior, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n3. **Lewis doesn't see Lewis.**\n   - According to the rule \"no donkeys saw a donkey that saw it,\" if Lewis were to see himself, it would violate this rule. Thus, Lewis cannot see himself. This statement must be true.\n\n4. **Lewis saw Lewis.**\n   - As explained above, this would violate the rule \"no donkeys saw a donkey that saw it.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, there is no information provided about Alfred's running behavior. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - Again, there is no information provided about Alfred's running behavior, and we only know that not all donkeys will run, so this statement does not have to be true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement that must be true is:\n- **3. Lewis doesn't see Lewis.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. Every monkey chased every donkey.\n4. A donkey chased a human that chased it.\n5. A monkey kicked Hazel only if no humans are asleep.\n6. If no humans chased Hazel, then Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- The information does not provide any direct evidence that a donkey chased every monkey. It only states that a donkey chased a human that chased it, which doesn't imply chasing every monkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- This statement is also not supported by the given information. We know that every monkey chased every donkey, but we do not have information about whether any donkey chased any monkey. Thus, we cannot conclude this statement as true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- The information does not directly support this statement. We know that every monkey chased every donkey, but there is no explicit mention of a donkey chasing a monkey. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- Similar to the previous analysis, there is no information supporting that every donkey chased every monkey. The given information only tells us about monkeys chasing donkeys, not vice versa. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- Again, the information does not support this statement. We know that every monkey chased every donkey, but there is no indication that every donkey chased at least one monkey. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n- According to the given information, \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\" This means that for any donkey, every monkey chased it. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**",

Conversely, if Hazel is a human, then Lewis must be a donkey.\n\n3. **A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - This implies that Lewis cannot be a donkey because there exists at least one hungry monkey.\n\n4. **Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - This means Alfred is not hungry, and Lewis must be hungry.\n\nNow let's analyze each statement based on these points:\n\n1. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - False, because it is stated that Alfred isn't hungry.\n\n2. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a contradiction. It states that Hazel being not a human implies Hazel is a human, which is logically impossible.\n\n3. **Hazel is a human.**\n   - From point 2, if Hazel were not a human, then Lewis would not be a donkey. However, from point 3, Lewis cannot be a donkey. Therefore, Hazel must be a human for the conditions to hold.\n\n4. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a contradiction similar to statement 2. It suggests that if Hazel is not a human, then she must be a human, which is logically impossible.\n\n5. **Hazel isn't a human.**\n   - False, because Hazel must be a human for the conditions to hold (as explained in analyzing statement 3).\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - Alfred is not hungry (point 4). Lewis is hungry (point 4). Thus, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. Hazel is a human.**\n\nFinal Answer: The statement that must be true is \"Hazel is a human.\"",

We only know that Lewis kicked Alfred, but we do not know Alfred's species. Thus, this cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis kicked every human.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, we only know that Lewis kicked Alfred.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement based on the provided conditions.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is exclusively a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. There is not a donkey that every donkey chased.\n4. Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\n5. Not all monkeys will run, but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased a human.\n- From condition 4, \"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human,\" we can infer that if any donkey chased a human, then every donkey would chase that donkey. However, this does not directly confirm that a donkey actually chased a human.\n- Condition 5 states that Hazel chased Alfred, but we do not know their types. If Hazel is a donkey and Alfred is a human, then this statement would be true. However, without more specific information about Hazel and Alfred's types, we cannot definitively conclude this.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey chased every human.\n- This statement is stronger than Statement 1. It requires that there exists at least one donkey who chased all humans. The given conditions do not provide enough information to confirm this.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey chased a human.\n- This statement implies that each individual donkey chased at least one human. Again, the given conditions do not provide enough information to confirm this.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased every human.\n- This statement is even stronger than Statement 2. It requires that every donkey chased all humans. The given conditions do not provide enough information to confirm this.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys chased every human.\n- This statement is the negation of Statement 4. Since we cannot confirm that every donkey chased every human, this statement could potentially be true. However, we need to check if there is any contradiction with other conditions.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased a human.\n- This statement is the negation of Statement 1. If no donkey chased a human, then condition 4 (\"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human\") would not apply, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true given the conditions is:\n\n**Statement 1: A donkey chased a human.**\n\nThis is because if Hazel chased Alfred (as per condition 5) and Hazel is a donkey while Alfred is a human, then this statement holds true. While we cannot definitively confirm the types of Hazel and Alfred from the given information alone, the structure of the conditions suggests that at least one donkey must have chased a human for the conditions to hold logically.",

Everything is exclusively a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\n4. A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\n5. If every human is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No monkeys chased every monkey.\n- This means there is at least one monkey that was not chased by another monkey.\n- From the condition \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it,\" we know that for every monkey \\(M\\), there exists a monkey \\(M'\\) such that \\(M\\) chased \\(M'\\) and \\(M'\\) chased \\(M\\). However, this does not imply that every monkey was chased by every other monkey.\n- Therefore, it is possible that no monkey chased every monkey.\n- **This statement could be true.**\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a monkey that every monkey chased.\n- This means there is a specific monkey that was chased by all other monkeys.\n- The given condition does not provide enough information to conclude that there is a single monkey chased by all others.\n- **This statement might be false.**\n\n#### Statement 3: Every monkey chased every monkey.\n- This would mean that for every pair of monkeys \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\), \\(M_1\\) chased \\(M_2\\) and \\(M_2\\) chased \\(M_1\\).\n- The given condition only states that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, which does not necessarily mean every monkey chased every other monkey.\n- **This statement is likely false.**\n\n#### Statement 4: A monkey chased a monkey.\n- This is directly implied by the condition \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\"\n- Since every monkey chased a monkey, there must exist at least one instance where a monkey chased another monkey.\n- **This statement must be true.**\n\n#### Statement 5: No monkeys chased a monkey.\n- This contradicts the given condition \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\"\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A monkey chased every monkey.\n- This would mean that there is a single monkey that chased all other monkeys.\n- The given condition does not provide enough information to conclude this.\n- **This statement might be false.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey chased a monkey.**",

If \"every human is asleep\" then it cannot be the case that \"not all humans are asleep.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel is a human and every donkey chased every human, it follows that every donkey chased Hazel. This statement must be true.\n\n3. **Hazel chased a donkey.**\n   - The information provided does not indicate that Hazel (a human) chased any donkey. Humans chasing donkeys is not mentioned as a rule. Thus, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased Hazel.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given information that every donkey chased every human. Since Hazel is a human, no donkeys not chasing her would be false. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Hazel chased every donkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, there is no information suggesting that Hazel chased any donkey. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys chased Hazel.**\n   - This statement also contradicts the given information that every donkey chased every human. Since Hazel is a human, it must be that all donkeys chased her. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n**Final Answer:** The only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n- **2. Every donkey chased Hazel.**",

Every monkey ate and a monkey is hungry.\n4. Hazel isn't asleep.\n5.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel ate based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis ate.\n- We know Lewis isn't hungry, but we do not have explicit information about whether Lewis ate or not. Being not hungry does not necessarily imply eating.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every monkey ate and Hazel isn't asleep.\n- We know every monkey ate and Hazel isn't asleep. This statement combines two pieces of information that are both true according to the given data. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis didn't eat.\n- Similar to Statement 2, we do not have enough information to determine whether Lewis ate or did not eat. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lewis didn't eat.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every monkey ate but it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.\n- We know every monkey ate, but we also know Hazel isn't asleep. The \"but\" part contradicts the given information. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis and Hazel ate.\n- We do not have information confirming that both Lewis and Hazel ate. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 3: Every monkey ate and Hazel isn't asleep.**\n\nThis statement directly aligns with the provided facts without introducing any contradictions or assumptions beyond what is given.",

Therefore, this cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n2. **Lewis and Hazel will attack**:\n   - We know a human will attack, but we do not have information about Hazel attacking.

Everything is exclusively a donkey, a human, or a monkey, with at least one of each.\n2. If no humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Lewis.\n3. Not all donkeys will run, but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n4. Not all humans will run.\n5. Only donkeys are asleep.\n\nFrom point 5, we know that no humans or monkeys are asleep. This means that the condition \"If no humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Lewis\" is always true because no humans are asleep. However, this does not give us direct information about whether Hazel chased Lewis or not, just that the implication holds.\n\nPoint 3 tells us that Hazel did chase Hazel, which is an interesting self-referential statement but doesn't directly help us determine who runs.\n\nPoint 4 states that not all humans will run, meaning there is at least one human who won't run.\n\nPoint 2 states that not all donkeys will run, meaning there is at least one donkey who won't run.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Not all humans will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - We know from point 4 that not all humans will run, so the first part is true. However, point 2 tells us that not all donkeys will run, so the second part is false. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys will run and no humans will run.**\n   - Point 2 confirms that not all donkeys will run, so the first part is true. However, point 4 only says that not all humans will run, not that no humans will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Every donkey will run and no humans will run.**\n   - Point 2 tells us that not all donkeys will run, so the first part is false. The second part is also false as per point 4. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Lewis will run.**\n   - There is no information given about whether Lewis will run or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Only humans will run and not all donkeys will run.**\n   - Point 4 tells us that not all humans will run, so the first part is false. Point 2 confirms that not all donkeys will run, so the second part is true. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys will run and not all humans will run.**\n   - Point 2 confirms that not all donkeys will run, and point 4 confirms that not all humans will run. Both parts of this statement are true.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**Final Answer: 6. Not all donkeys will run and not all humans will run.**",

Therefore, Alfred is either a donkey or a monkey.\n- The statement \"A donkey kicked every donkey\" implies that donkeys interact with other donkeys, but it doesn't provide direct information about whether donkeys will attack or not.\n- \"Hazel saw Hazel\" suggests that Hazel is self-aware and can see herself, which is more likely to be a characteristic of a human. Thus, Hazel is most likely a human.\n- \"No humans will attack\" means that none of the humans in this scenario will engage in an attack.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Not all humans will attack.**\n   - This is true because we know that no humans will attack, so it's certainly true that not all humans will attack.\n\n2. **Only humans will attack.**\n   - This is false because no humans will attack, so it cannot be true that only humans will attack.\n\n3. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine if Alfred will attack.

The information about drinking is linked to kicking and eating, but it does not directly tell us about Lewis's drinking behavior.\n\n2. **No humans ate if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis.**\n   - This statement can be written as: \\( \\neg A(H) \\leftrightarrow \\neg K(H, L) \\).\n   - From the given information, we know \\( \\neg A(H) \\rightarrow \\neg Dr(D) \\) and \\( \\neg Dr(D) \\leftrightarrow \\neg K(H, L) \\). Combining these, we get \\( \\neg A(H) \\rightarrow \\neg K(H, L) \\).\n   - However, the reverse implication (\\( \\neg K(H, L) \\rightarrow \\neg A(H) \\)) is not necessarily true from the given information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis ate.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, we do not have direct information about whether Lewis ate or not. The information about eating is linked to drinking and kicking, but it does not directly tell us about Lewis's eating behavior.\n\n4. **Lewis didn't eat.**\n   - Again, similar to the previous statements, we do not have direct information about whether Lewis ate or not. The information about eating is linked to drinking and kicking, but it does not directly tell us about Lewis's eating behavior.\n\n5. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - We do not have any specific information that tells us what Lewis is. The information given does not specify Lewis's type.\n\n6. **Lewis didn't drink.**\n   - We do not have direct information about whether Lewis drank or not.

Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: A human chased Lewis.\n- It is explicitly stated that \"No humans chased Lewis.\" Thus, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis chased every human.\n- Similar to Statement 1, there is no information indicating that Lewis chased anyone, let alone every human. This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human chased Lewis.\n- Again, it is explicitly stated that \"No humans chased Lewis.\" Hence, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all humans chased Lewis.\n- Since it is explicitly stated that \"No humans chased Lewis,\" it follows that not all humans chased Lewis. This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred will attack.\n- The information states that \"A human will attack\" and \"Hazel is a monkey.\" However, there is no specific mention of Alfred attacking. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will attack based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

However, there is no contradiction here with the given information. We cannot definitively conclude that Lewis isn't a donkey based solely on the given information.\n\n2. **Hazel is a donkey.**\n   - Given that no donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel saw herself, Hazel cannot be a donkey because donkeys are not self-aware. Thus, Hazel must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a donkey.**\n   - As reasoned above, since Hazel saw herself and no donkeys saw Hazel, Hazel cannot be a donkey. This statement must be true.\n\n4. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - There is no direct information about Alfred's species. The fact that not all donkeys kicked Alfred does not specify Alfred's identity. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred is a donkey.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't a donkey.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, there is no direct information about Alfred's species. We cannot conclude that Alfred isn't a donkey based on the given information.\n\n6. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - While it is possible for Lewis to be a donkey, there is no definitive evidence from the given information to confirm this. Lewis could also be a human or a monkey.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. Hazel isn't a donkey.**",

Since every monkey ate, Lewis cannot be a monkey because if he were, he would have eaten.

Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n2. **A monkey is happy and every human chased Alfred.**\n   - The happiness of a monkey is not mentioned. Also, the condition about chasing does not provide enough information to conclude that every human chased Alfred. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - We do not have information about Alfred's species. If Alfred is a human, he would be happy because every human is happy. However, if Alfred is a monkey or a donkey, we cannot determine his happiness. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel are happy.**\n   - Similar to the previous analysis, we do not have information about Alfred's species. Hazel's happiness is also not directly stated. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't happy.**\n   - As with the previous statements, we lack sufficient information about Alfred's species to determine his happiness status.

Conversely, if every human is awake, then all humans must have kicked Lewis.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement based on these conditions:\n\n1. **No donkeys kicked a human.**\n   - This contradicts the given condition \"A donkey kicked every human.\" Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n   - The given condition only states that a donkey kicked every human, not necessarily that every donkey did so. Thus, this is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - The given condition does not specify that every donkey kicked every human; it only says that a donkey kicked every human. Hence, this is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A donkey kicked a human.**\n   - This is directly supported by the given condition \"A donkey kicked every human.\" Therefore, this must be true.\n\n5. **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n   - This contradicts the given condition \"A donkey kicked every human.\" Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n6. **There is a donkey that every human kicked.**\n   - The given conditions do not provide any information about humans kicking donkeys. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. A donkey kicked a human.**",

Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n6. **A human saw every monkey.**\n   - Again, the condition does not guarantee that any specific human saw all monkeys, only those that saw them. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 2: A human saw every monkey that saw it.\n- Statement 4: A human saw a monkey.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 2 and 4 must be true.",

However, this does not imply that every donkey chased every monkey. It only implies a reciprocal chasing relationship between some donkeys and monkeys.\n- Therefore, it is possible that no donkey chased every monkey, making this statement potentially true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys chased a monkey.\n- This would mean that no donkey ever chased any monkey.\n- The chasing behavior states that every monkey chased a donkey that chased it, which directly contradicts this statement.\n- Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- This would mean that each donkey chased all the monkeys.\n- The chasing behavior does not provide enough information to conclude that every donkey chased every monkey; it only indicates a reciprocal chasing relationship.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- This would mean that each donkey chased at least one monkey.\n- The chasing behavior does not specify that every donkey chased a monkey, only that every monkey chased a donkey that chased it.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- This would mean that there is at least one donkey that chased all the monkeys.\n- Similar to Statement 3, the chasing behavior does not provide enough information to conclude this.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- This would mean that there is at least one instance where a donkey chased a monkey.\n- The chasing behavior states that every monkey chased a donkey that chased it, implying that there must be at least one donkey that chased a monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**Statement 6: A donkey chased a monkey.**",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. A human saw a monkey that saw a monkey.\n4. Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n5. No donkeys saw Hazel.\n6. No donkeys kicked Alfred unless every donkey will attack.\n7. Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n8. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Hazel's Identity**: From point 7, if Hazel isn't a human, then every donkey saw Hazel. Since Hazel can't see herself (point 4), Hazel cannot be a human because if she were, the condition \"Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel\" would be irrelevant. Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n- **Donkeys and Hazel**: Point 5 states that no donkeys saw Hazel. This means Hazel cannot be a donkey (since a donkey wouldn't see another donkey). Thus, Hazel must be a monkey.\n- **Alfred's Condition**: Point 6 implies that if not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel. Since Hazel is a monkey, this condition involves Alfred seeing himself under specific circumstances related to kicking actions.\n- **Human Seeing Monkey**: Point 3 indicates a human saw a monkey that saw a monkey. This confirms the existence of humans and monkeys and their interactions.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Every donkey saw a human** - Not necessarily true. The information does not provide enough detail to confirm this.\n2. **No donkeys saw a human** - Also not necessarily true. We have no direct information about whether some donkeys saw a human.\n3. **No donkeys saw every human** - This could be true since we know no donkeys saw Hazel (who is a monkey), but it's not definitively proven from the given information.\n4. **A donkey saw a human** - Possible but not confirmed. The information does not directly support this.\n5. **Every donkey saw every human** - Not supported by the given information.\n6. **A donkey saw every human** - Not supported by the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the statements are definitively proven to be true based solely on the given information. However, the most plausible statement based on the analysis is:\n\n**Statement 3: No donkeys saw every human.**\n\nThis is because we know for sure that no donkeys saw Hazel (who is a monkey), and thus it's reasonable to infer that not all donkeys saw every human, though this is not conclusively proven from the given conditions alone.",

But logically, if every monkey saw a human, it suggests that there is at least one human who saw a monkey, because the act of seeing is reciprocal in this context.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**2.

However, we do not have enough information to determine whether Hazel chased Alfred or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\"\n- The second part of this statement (\"Alfred didn't chase Alfred\") is trivially true because no entity can chase itself. However, we need to check the first part. Since we know \"not all donkeys chased Alfred,\" it does not necessarily mean \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\"\n- This statement implies two parts: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" and \"Hazel chased Alfred.\" The first part could be true, but we lack information to confirm the second part. Hence, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n- The first part is true since \"not all donkeys chased Alfred.\" The second part is also true because Hazel doesn't see Hazel. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\"\n- The second part is trivially false because Alfred cannot chase himself. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n- We do not have enough information to conclude whether Hazel chased Alfred or not. Additionally, we cannot conclude that no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that can be definitively concluded as true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\"**\n\nThus, my final answer is:\n\n**Statement 4 must be true.**",

If Hazel were a donkey, she would have seen herself, which contradicts the rule that Hazel doesn't see Hazel. Therefore, Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n- **Conclusion**: This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred drank.\n- Since only humans drank and Alfred isn't specified as a human, we cannot conclude that Alfred drank based on the given information.\n- **Conclusion**: This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel isn't a donkey.\n- As analyzed above, Hazel cannot be a donkey because she wouldn't be able to see herself.\n- **Conclusion**: This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Hazel drank.\n- Only humans drank, and Hazel cannot be a donkey (as shown). However, without knowing Hazel's exact classification (human or monkey) and Alfred's classification, we cannot definitively say they both drank.\n- **Conclusion**: This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred didn't drink.\n- Since only humans drank and Alfred isn't specified as a human, it follows that Alfred didn't drink.\n- **Conclusion**: This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Lewis drank.\n- Lewis did not drink, so this statement is false regardless of whether Alfred drank or not.\n- **Conclusion**: This statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 3: Hazel isn't a donkey.**\n- **Statement 5: Alfred didn't drink.**",

Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A human kicked every monkey.\n- Condition 2 does not specify that every human kicks every monkey, only that every human kicks at least one monkey that kicked them. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans kicked a monkey.\n- This directly contradicts condition 2, which states that every human kicked a monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: No humans kicked every monkey.\n- Since condition 2 only requires that every human kicks at least one monkey, it doesn't preclude the possibility that some humans might kick every monkey. However, it also doesn't guarantee that no human kicks every monkey. The information provided is insufficient to conclude this definitively, so this statement cannot be determined as true based solely on the given conditions.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a human that every monkey kicked.\n- Condition 2 specifies that every human kicked a monkey that kicked it, but it does not provide information about whether every monkey kicked a specific human. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every human kicked every monkey.\n- Similar to statement 2, condition 2 does not imply that every human kicks every monkey. It only states that every human kicks at least one monkey that kicked them. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**Statement 1: A human kicked a monkey.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement based on the provided conditions.\n\nGiven:\n- Everything is exclusively a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n- There's at least one of each.\n- Every human kicked a donkey that kicked it.\n- A human is happy.\n- Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n- If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **A donkey kicked every human.**\n   - This statement suggests that for every human, there exists at least one donkey that has kicked them. The condition \"Every human kicked a donkey that kicked it\" implies that for every human, there is a donkey that has been kicked by that human and subsequently kicked back. However, this does not necessarily mean that every human was kicked by a donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - This statement is very strong and suggests that each donkey has kicked every single human. There is no information provided that supports this claim directly. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n   - This statement means that each donkey has kicked at least one human. Given the condition \"Every human kicked a donkey that kicked it,\" we can infer that for every human, there is a donkey that has been kicked by that human and subsequently kicked back. This implies that every donkey that was kicked by a human must have kicked that human back. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked a human.**\n   - This statement contradicts the condition \"Every human kicked a donkey that kicked it.\" Since every human kicked a donkey that kicked it back, it is impossible for no donkeys to have kicked a human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked a human.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, this statement means that at least one donkey has kicked at least one human. Based on the same reasoning as statement 3, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is at least one human who was not kicked by any donkey. While the given conditions do not provide enough information to definitively conclude this, the condition \"Every human kicked a donkey that kicked it\" does not rule out the possibility that some humans were not kicked by any donkey. However, since we know from statement 3 that every donkey kicked a human, it is not necessarily true that no donkeys kicked every human. Therefore, this statement cannot be conclusively determined as true based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- Statement 3: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- Statement 5: A donkey kicked a human.",

Since we only know that every human chased Alfred, and not whether donkeys chased Alfred, we cannot conclude that Alfred is happy.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - True, because \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\" This implies that none of the donkeys kicked Hazel, so certainly not all of them did.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - False, because \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\n6. **Hazel kicked a donkey.**\n   - We do not have enough information to confirm this. It could be true or false depending on Hazel's actions, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**",
