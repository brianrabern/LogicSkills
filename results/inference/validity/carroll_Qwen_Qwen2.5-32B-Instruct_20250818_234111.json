Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every tove chortled at a rath.\n4. A borogove chortled at a borogove that chortled at a tove.\n5. Bungo chortled at a borogove.\n6. Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle.\n7. It is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n8. Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo just in case every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n1. **No toves chortled at a rath.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given condition that \"Every tove chortled at a rath.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **There is a tove that every rath chortled at.**\n   - The given information does not provide any direct evidence about raths chortling at toves. Thus, we cannot conclude this statement as necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at every rath.**\n   - The given information only states that every tove chortled at a rath, but it doesn't specify whether they chortled at every rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n4. **A tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, the given information does not provide enough detail to confirm that a single tove chortled at every rath. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - Again, the given information only states that every tove chortled at a rath, not necessarily every rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at a rath.**\n   - This aligns with the given condition that \"Every tove chortled at a rath,\" which implies that at least one tove chortled at a rath. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**6. A tove chortled at a rath.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.\n4. If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n5. A borogove chortled at Rafin.\n6. Only toves are mimsy.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A tove galumphed over a borogove.\n- From point 3, we know there is a tove that every borogove galumphed over. This implies that at least one tove was galumphed over by at least one borogove. Therefore, it is true that a tove galumphed over a borogove.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every tove galumphed over a borogove.\n- The information provided does not specify that every tove galumphed over a borogove. It only states that there is a specific tove that every borogove galumphed over. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every tove galumphed over every borogove.\n- Similar to Statement 2, the information does not support that every tove galumphed over every borogove. It only mentions a specific tove being galumphed over by every borogove. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No toves galumphed over every borogove.\n- This statement contradicts the information given in point 3, which states that there is a tove that every borogove galumphed over. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A tove galumphed over every borogove.\n- This statement aligns with the information given in point 3, which states that there is a tove that every borogove galumphed over. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A borogove galumphed over a tove.\n- The information provided does not give any direct evidence that a borogove galumphed over a tove. It only specifies that every borogove galumphed over a specific tove. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- **Statement 1**: A tove galumphed over a borogove.\n- **Statement 5**: A tove galumphed over every borogove.\n\nThus, the final answer is that Statements 1 and 5 must be true.",

Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Statement 4** (\"If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove\") is a contradiction because it implies that Bungo must be a borogove regardless of the initial condition. Therefore, Bungo must be a borogove.\n- Since Bungo is a borogove, we can eliminate any contradictions involving Bungo not being a borogove.\n- From **statement 6**, \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo,\" we know Bungo did not chortle at itself.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **No borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - There is no direct information about whether borogoves chortled at Bungo or not. This cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n2. **Every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, there is no information indicating that every borogove chortled at Bungo. This cannot be concluded either.\n\n3. **Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Again, there is no specific information about the actions of all borogoves towards Bungo. This cannot be concluded definitively.\n\n4. **Bungo chortled at every borogove.**\n   - We know Bungo did not chortle at Bungo, but there is no information about Bungo chortling at other borogoves. This cannot be concluded.\n\n5. **Bungo chortled at a borogove.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that Bungo chortled at any borogove. This cannot be concluded.\n\n6. **A borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - There is no direct information about a borogove chortling at Bungo.

The conditional statement only mentions a rath galumphing over Bungo under certain conditions, not the reverse.\n\n2. **Every rath galumphed over Bungo**:\n   - This would imply that Bungo is a specific entity that every rath has galumphed over. However, the conditional statement only suggests that a rath galumphed over Bungo unless every tove snicker-snacked Zindle. Since not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, it does not necessarily mean every rath did so.\n\n3. **A rath galumphed over Bungo**:\n   - Given the conditional statement \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless every tove snicker-snacked Zindle,\" and knowing that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, it follows that a rath indeed galumphed over Bungo.\n\n4. **Not all raths galumphed over Bungo**:\n   - This statement cannot be definitively concluded from the given information. We know at least one rath galumphed over Bungo, but we do not have enough information to determine whether all raths did so.\n\n5. **Bungo galumphed over a rath**:\n   - There is no information suggesting that Bungo galumphed over any rath. The conditional statement only provides information about a rath galumphing over Bungo.\n\n6. **No raths galumphed over Bungo**:\n   - This directly contradicts the conditional statement and the fact that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, which implies that at least one rath galumphed over Bungo.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**3.

This is because if no toves are uffish, then the second part of the disjunction in statement 3 must be true, which means every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nThus, we conclude:\n- Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the provided statements based on our conclusion:\n\n1. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - We have no information about whether Zindle is uffish or not. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This is directly derived from our analysis. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts our conclusion that every tove snicker-snacked Zindle. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n4. **Zindle snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle's actions towards toves.

If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - This statement involves hypotheticals about raths snicker-snacking Bungo and galumphing over Rafin. There isn't enough information directly linking these actions to Zindle's behavior towards Bungo. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given conditions.\n\n2. **Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and every rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - We know that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle, but it is stated that not all raths galumphed over Rafin. Thus, this statement is false because it claims every rath galumphed over Rafin.\n\n3. **Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This statement suggests a conditional relationship between Zindle's action and raths' actions. The given conditions do not provide enough information to establish this specific relationship definitively.\n\n4. **Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and not all raths galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - We know both parts of this statement are true: Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle, and not all raths galumphed over Rafin. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **If Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo, then not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This statement suggests a conditional relationship similar to statement 3. Again, the given conditions do not provide enough information to establish this relationship definitively.\n\n6. **Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Bungo and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - We know Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Bungo, but there is no direct information about whether a rath galumphed over Zindle.

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **No borogoves chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This contradicts the given condition that every borogove chortled at every borogove. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **No borogoves chortled at a borogove that chortled at it.**\n   - Since every borogove chortled at every borogove, this includes chortling at themselves indirectly through the transitive property. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle is a tove.**\n   - The conditional chortling does not provide enough information about the classification of Zindle, Rafin, or Bungo. Therefore, we cannot determine if Zindle is a tove based on the given information.

We know from the problem that \"Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle,\" but we don't have direct information about whether Zindle chortled at Rafin. However, since we know a borogove chortled at Rafin, it doesn't necessarily mean that borogove is mimsy. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude this statement as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - False: The problem directly states \"Zindle isn't mimsy.\"\n\n4. **If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This is a complex conditional statement. Since \"Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle\" is given, the condition \"only if Zindle chortled at Zindle\" is false. Thus, the entire statement is vacuously true because the consequent of an implication is always true when the antecedent is false.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - False: The problem states \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" but also \"Zindle isn't mimsy.\" The second part of this statement contradicts the given information.\n\n6. **Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin unless a borogove is mimsy.**\n   - This can be interpreted as \"If a borogove is not mimsy, then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.\" We do not have enough information to determine if a borogove is mimsy or not, so we cannot conclusively say this statement is true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 1: A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 1 must be true.",

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n5. **A borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - While it is possible that some borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, the given information does not confirm this.

If Zindle gimbled, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if no toves gimbled.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No raths chortled at a rath that chortled at it.\n- This statement suggests that there is no mutual chortling between raths.\n- However, since every rath chortled at every rath, including itself (as indicated by \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\"), this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is not a rath that every rath chortled at.\n- Since every rath chortled at every rath, this means every rath was chortled at by every other rath.\n- Therefore, this statement is false because every rath is chortled at by every other rath.\n\n#### Statement 3: No raths chortled at a rath.\n- This directly contradicts the given condition that every rath chortled at every rath.\n- Thus, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: No raths chortled at every rath.\n- This statement claims that there is no rath that chortled at every other rath.\n- However, the given condition states that every rath chortled at every rath, so this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Zindle will whiffle.\n- The information about Zindle only involves a conditional statement about gimbled and snicker-snacked actions.\n- There is no direct information about whether Zindle will whiffle or not.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A rath chortled at every rath.\n- This statement aligns with the given condition that every rath chortled at every rath.\n- Hence, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**Statement 6: A rath chortled at every rath.**",

Everything is exclusively a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.\n4. No borogoves are beamish.\n5. If every tove chortled at Bungo, then every rath chortled at Rafin.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - This statement suggests a conditional relationship between Zindle not chortling at Bungo and no borogoves being beamish. However, the fact that no borogoves are beamish does not directly affect whether Zindle chortled at Bungo or not. The given information only states that Zindle did not chortle at Bungo, which is independent of the beamishness of borogoves. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - There is no information provided about the beamishness of Zindle or Rafin. Thus, we cannot conclude that they are beamish based on the given information.\n\n3. **Zindle and Bungo are beamish.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, there is no information about the beamishness of Zindle or Bungo. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **If no borogoves are beamish, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - The first part of the statement \"if no borogoves are beamish\" is true according to the given information. However, the second part \"then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo\" introduces a new condition that is not supported by the given information. We know Zindle did not chortle at Bungo, but there is no information about Zindle chortling at Zindle or about borogoves chortling at Bungo. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Zindle just in case Bungo isn't beamish.**\n   - There is no information linking the chortling behavior of borogoves towards Zindle with the beamishness of Bungo. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - There is no information provided about the beamishness of Zindle. Thus, we cannot conclude that Zindle is beamish based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the statements can be conclusively determined to be true based solely on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer: None of the statements must be true in this situation.**",

Therefore, not all raths can snicker-snack Rafin, meaning some raths did not snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n5. **If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. It says that if a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then for every rath to snicker-snack Bungo, Bungo must not have snicker-snacked himself.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Every tove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - False, because we know no toves chortled at Bungo, who is a borogove.\n\n2. **Every tove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - False, for the same reason as above; no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at a borogove.**\n   - True, since no toves chortled at Bungo, and Bungo is a borogove.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at every borogove.**\n   - True, because no toves chortled at Bungo, who is a borogove.\n\n5. **A tove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - False, because no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - False, because no toves chortled at Bungo, who is a borogove.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statements that must be true are:\n- 3.

This statement must be true.\n\n2. **Every tove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This directly contradicts the condition \"No toves chortled at a borogove.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n3. **Every tove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - Again, this contradicts the condition \"No toves chortled at a borogove.\" Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n4. **A tove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - The condition \"No toves chortled at a borogove\" means that no tove chortled at any borogove. Hence, this statement must be false.\n\n5. **A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.**\n   - This statement is contradictory because it asserts both that a borogove will burble and that no borogoves will burble. It cannot be true under any circumstances.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - Similar to the previous statements, this contradicts the condition \"No toves chortled at a borogove.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 1.

Therefore, all borogoves are mimsy.\n\n3. **A borogove chortled at every tove that chortled at it.**\n   - This indicates a reciprocal relationship between toves and borogoves regarding chortling. If a tove chortles at a borogove, the borogove will also chortle back at that tove.\n\n4. **If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This conditional statement can be broken down as follows:\n     - If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n     - This suggests a complex condition involving Bungo's actions and reactions from borogoves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the provided information:\n\n1. **No borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - This contradicts the given fact that every borogove is mimsy. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Bungo is mimsy.**\n   - We do not have enough information about Bungo's category to conclude this definitively. Bungo could be a tove, borogove, or rath.\n\n3. **Not all borogoves are mimsy if and only if a borogove is mimsy.**\n   - This statement is logically contradictory because if every borogove is mimsy, it cannot be true that not all borogoves are mimsy. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Only borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - Given that every borogove is mimsy, this statement would imply no other category (toves or raths) can be mimsy. However, we don't have information excluding the possibility of toves or raths being mimsy. Therefore, this statement cannot be conclusively true.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given fact that every borogove is mimsy. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **A borogove is mimsy.**\n   - Since every borogove is mimsy, this statement must be true.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement that must be true is \"A borogove is mimsy.\"",

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked it.\n4. A rath galumphed over a tove that galumphed over a tove.\n5. Every rath galumphed over Rafin only if not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.\n- This means that for every tove, there exists at least one borogove that the tove did not snicker-snack.\n- From the given condition, every tove snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked it. However, this does not imply that every tove snicker-snacked every borogove. Therefore, this statement could be true, but we need more specific information to confirm.\n\n#### Statement 2: No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\n- This means no tove has ever snicker-snacked any borogove.\n- The given condition states that every tove snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked it, which directly contradicts this statement. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.\n- This means there exists at least one tove such that every borogove has snicker-snacked it.\n- The given condition does not provide enough information to determine whether this is true or false. It only tells us about the relationship between a tove and a specific borogove that snicker-snacked it, not about every borogove.\n\n#### Statement 4: A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\n- This means there exists at least one tove that snicker-snacked every borogove.\n- The given condition does not provide enough information to determine whether this is true or false. It only tells us about the relationship between a tove and a specific borogove that snicker-snacked it, not about every borogove.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\n- This means every tove has snicker-snacked every borogove.\n- The given condition does not provide enough information to determine whether this is true or false. It only tells us about the relationship between a tove and a specific borogove that snicker-snacked it, not about every borogove.\n\n#### Statement 6: A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\n- This means there exists at least one tove that snicker-snacked at least one borogove.\n- The given condition states that every tove snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked it, which implies that at least one tove snicker-snacked a borogove.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. No toves are mimsy.\n4. If every borogove is mimsy, then Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\n5. Rafin is a tove.\n6. Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since Rafin is a tove, and no toves are mimsy, Rafin cannot be mimsy.\n- Bungo being a rath does not provide direct information about whether Bungo is mimsy or not.\n- The statement \"If every borogove is mimsy, then Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" can be broken down as follows:\n  - Let \\( P \\) represent \"every borogove is mimsy.\"\n  - Let \\( Q \\) represent \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin.\"\n  - Let \\( R \\) represent \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\"\n  - The statement can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow (Q \\rightarrow R) \\).\n\nSince Rafin is a tove and no toves are mimsy, we know that Rafin did not snicker-snack Rafin (because the action of snicker-snacking implies some form of interaction which would contradict the exclusivity of categories). Therefore, \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nGiven \\( Q \\) is true, the implication \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) simplifies to \\( R \\) (since a true antecedent makes the implication true regardless of the consequent). Thus, \\( R \\) must be true, meaning not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\n\nHowever, this does not directly tell us anything about whether Zindle is mimsy or not. We need more information to determine Zindle's status regarding mimsiness.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n- **6. Rafin isn't mimsy.**\n\nThis is because Rafin is a tove, and no toves are mimsy. The other statements cannot be definitively concluded from the given information.",

If Rath A snicker-snacked Rath B, then Rath B also snicker-snacked Rath A.\n\n3. **A rath snicker-snacked Zindle and every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - Zindle is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath. Since a rath snicker-snacked Zindle, Zindle cannot be a rath (because it would contradict the exclusivity). Therefore, Zindle is either a tove or a borogove. Also, every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n4. **A rath is uffish but it is not the case that Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This means Rafin did snicker-snack Bungo. Rafin could be a rath, a borogove, or a tove. Bungo could be any of these as well.\n\n5. **Every tove chortled at Bungo only if not all toves are beamish.**\n   - This condition does not directly affect the snicker-snacking relationships but provides additional context about the behavior of toves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - True. Given the mutual snicker-snacking relationship among raths, if there is at least one rath, it must snicker-snack another rath.\n\n2. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Not necessarily true. The mutual snicker-snacking relationship does not imply that one rath snicker-snacks all other raths.\n\n3. **Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Not necessarily true. While every rath snicker-snacks a rath that snicker-snacked it, this does not mean every rath snicker-snacks every other rath.\n\n4. **No raths snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - False. We know from the mutual snicker-snacking relationship that some raths do snicker-snack other raths.\n\n5. **No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Not necessarily true. It is possible for a rath to snicker-snack every other rath, but it is not required by the given conditions.\n\n6. **There is a rath that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n   - Not necessarily true. The mutual snicker-snacking relationship does not guarantee that there is a single rath that every other rath snicker-snacks.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement that must be true is:\n1.

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the provided information.\n\n2. **Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that every tove snicker-snacked every rath. The information only indicates that every rath snicker-snacked a tove, which does not imply the reverse action for all toves and raths. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - Similar to the previous analysis, there is no information indicating that every tove snicker-snacked a rath. The given information only tells us about the actions of raths towards toves, not vice versa. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that there exists at least one tove that snicker-snacked every rath. However, the provided information does not support this claim. We only know that every rath snicker-snacked a tove, which does not imply that a single tove snicker-snacked all raths. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Since we do not have any information that supports the idea that any tove snicker-snacked every rath, it is reasonable to infer that no toves did so. However, this is more of an absence of evidence rather than a definitive conclusion from the given information. Thus, while plausible, it is not definitively supported.\n\n6. **A rath snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - According to the given information, \"every rath snicker-snacked a tove.\" This directly implies that at least one rath snicker-snacked a tove, making this statement true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 6. A rath snicker-snacked a tove.**",

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Either Bungo or Rafin is beamish.\n4. If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n5. Only borogoves are beamish.\n6. It is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy (which means Bungo is mimsy).\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 5, we know that only borogoves can be beamish. This implies that if Bungo or Rafin is beamish, they must be borogoves.\n- Since Bungo is mimsy (point 6), and from point 4, if not all borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo galumphing over Zindle depends on every borogove chortling at Bungo. However, since Bungo is mimsy, the condition \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" does not apply directly to Bungo's mimsiness.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **A borogove is beamish.**\n   - True, because only borogoves are beamish, and either Bungo or Rafin is beamish, so at least one borogove is beamish.\n\n2. **No borogoves are beamish.**\n   - False, because we established that at least one borogove is beamish.\n\n3. **Not all borogoves are beamish.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude this from the given information. The problem states that only borogoves are beamish, but it doesn't specify whether all borogoves are beamish or not.\n\n4. **Every borogove is beamish.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude this from the given information. The problem states that only borogoves are beamish, but it doesn't specify whether all borogoves are beamish or not.\n\n5. **Only borogoves are beamish and not all borogoves are beamish.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude this from the given information. While it is true that only borogoves are beamish, we do not have enough information to determine if not all borogoves are beamish.\n\n6. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude this from the given information.

Since no borogoves chortled at Zindle, the condition \"A borogove chortled at Zindle just in case Bungo isn't beamish\" implies that Bungo must be beamish.

However, the given information does not provide enough details to confirm this universally for all raths. It only states that every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it, but not necessarily that every rath was chortled at by a borogove.\n\n2. **No borogoves chortled at every rath.**\n   - This statement implies that there is no borogove that chortled at all raths. The given information does not provide enough detail to confirm or deny this statement definitively.\n\n3. **Every borogove chortled at every rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that each borogove chortled at all raths. Again, the given information does not support this claim as it only mentions interactions between specific raths and borogoves without specifying universality.\n\n4. **Every borogove chortled at a rath.**\n   - This statement means that each borogove chortled at at least one rath. Given that every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it, it implies some form of interaction between borogoves and raths. However, the information does not specify that every borogove must have chortled at a rath.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at a rath.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is at least one instance where a borogove chortled at a rath. Since every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it, it logically follows that there must be at least one borogove that chortled at a rath. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No borogoves chortled at a rath.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given information that every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**5.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Only borogoves are beamish.\n4. Not all raths galumphed over Rafin.\n5. Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n6. It is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove (which means Rafin is a tove).\n7. Zindle isn't a borogove unless no borogoves are beamish.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since Rafin is a tove, and only borogoves are beamish, Rafin cannot be beamish. Therefore, statement 1 (\"Rafin is beamish\") is false.\n- From point 7, \"Zindle isn't a borogove unless no borogoves are beamish,\" we can infer that if there is at least one beamish borogove, then Zindle cannot be a borogove. Since it is stated that only borogoves are beamish, and there is at least one borogove (as per the initial condition), Zindle cannot be a borogove. Thus, Zindle must be either a tove or a rath.\n- Since Zindle is not a borogove, Zindle cannot be beamish (because only borogoves are beamish). This makes statement 4 (\"Zindle isn't beamish\") true.\n- Statements 2 (\"Zindle and Bungo are beamish\") and 3 (\"Zindle and Rafin are beamish\") are both false because Zindle cannot be beamish.\n- Statement 5 (\"Zindle is beamish\") is false for the same reason as above.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**4.

This implies a chain of chortling between these three types.\n3. **Rafin's Chortling**: Rafin chortled at every borogove. This means Rafin, who must be either a tove, borogove, or rath, chortled at all borogoves.\n4. **Snicker-Snacking**: No toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo. This suggests a conditional relationship between toves' actions and raths' actions.\n5. **Galumphing**:\n   - If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n   - If Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo, then every rath galumphed over Rafin only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. **A borogove chortled at Rafin**: The information does not provide direct evidence for this statement. Rafin chortled at every borogove, but it doesn't imply that a borogove chortled at Rafin.\n   \n2. **Not all borogoves chortled at Rafin**: Since Rafin chortled at every borogove, this statement contradicts the given information. Therefore, this cannot be true.\n\n3. **No borogoves chortled at Rafin**: Similar to option 2, this also contradicts the given information since Rafin chortled at every borogove.\n\n4. **Rafin chortled at a borogove**: This is directly stated in the problem: \"Rafin chortled at every borogove.\" Thus, this must be true.\n\n5. **Every borogove chortled at Rafin**: There is no information suggesting that every borogove chortled at Rafin. The information only states that Rafin chortled at every borogove.\n\n6. **Zindle is a tove**: The information about Zindle is limited to its interactions with other entities through snicker-snacking and galumphing. There is no explicit information stating what type Zindle is.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. Rafin chortled at a borogove.**\n\nThis is the only statement that is directly supported by the given information without contradiction.",

Since Zindle and Rafin are both mimsy, and Rafin is specifically identified as a tove, it means at least one tove (Rafin) is mimsy.\n2. The condition \"If Zindle is mimsy, then a tove galumphed over Bungo\" is satisfied because Zindle is indeed mimsy.\n3. No borogoves will whiffle, which doesn't directly affect the mimsiness of toves or raths.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Every tove is mimsy.**\n   - We only know that Rafin, who is a tove, is mimsy. There is no information suggesting every tove is mimsy. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **No toves are mimsy.**\n   - This is false because Rafin, who is a tove, is mimsy.\n\n3. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - There is no information about whether Zindle will whiffle or not. The only information provided is that Zindle is mimsy, which does not imply anything about whiffling.\n\n4. **Not all toves are mimsy.**\n   - While we know at least one tove (Rafin) is mimsy, we do not have enough information to conclude that not all toves are mimsy. However, since we don't have evidence that all toves are mimsy, this statement could be true, but it's not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n5. **A tove is mimsy.**\n   - This is true because Rafin, who is a tove, is mimsy.\n\n6. **Only toves are mimsy.**\n   - We know Zindle and Rafin are mimsy, and Rafin is a tove. However, we do not have information about Zindle's type, so we cannot conclude that only toves are mimsy.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5.

However, the condition \"no borogoves are beamish just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\" does not directly link to whether only toves gyred. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle gyred.**\n   - The information about Zindle's actions (snicker-snacking and galumphing) does not provide any direct evidence about whether Zindle gyred. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n3. **Not all toves gyred just in case no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - According to the given information, \"not all toves gyred if and only if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\" Additionally, \"no borogoves are beamish just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\" These two conditions are equivalent, meaning that \"not all toves gyred\" is equivalent to \"no borogoves are beamish.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **No borogoves are beamish or only toves gyred.**\n   - This statement is a disjunction. Given that \"not all toves gyred\" is equivalent to \"no borogoves are beamish,\" it implies that either \"no borogoves are beamish\" or \"only toves gyred\" must be true. Since these conditions are linked, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves are beamish and every tove gyred.**\n   - The information does not provide a direct link between the beamishness of borogoves and the gyring of toves. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n6. **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Zindle and Rafin specifically gyred.

A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Zindle and Rafin are mimsy.\n- The information does not provide direct evidence about whether Zindle and Rafin are mimsy. We know that every rath is mimsy, but we do not have enough information to conclude that Zindle and Rafin are raths or mimsy.\n\n#### Statement 2: Only raths are mimsy.\n- This statement would imply that no toves or borogoves can be mimsy. However, the information provided does not exclude the possibility that toves or borogoves could also be mimsy. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: No raths are mimsy.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that every rath is mimsy. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: A rath is mimsy.\n- This is consistent with the given information that every rath is mimsy. Since there is at least one rath, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Zindle is mimsy.\n- Similar to Statement 1, there is no direct evidence provided that Zindle is a rath or mimsy. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all raths are mimsy.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that every rath is mimsy.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement based on that information.\n\nGiven:\n- Everything is exclusively a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n- There is at least one of each type.\n- Either Bungo or Rafin is uffish.\n- Bungo is beamish.\n- No toves will burble just in case Bungo isn't beamish.\n\nFrom the last point, we can infer that since Bungo is beamish, it does not imply that no toves will burble. Therefore, the condition \"no toves will burble\" only applies when Bungo is not beamish, which is not the case here. This means that the statement about toves not burbling is irrelevant because Bungo is beamish.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A tove will burble.**\n   - The information provided does not give us enough details to definitively say that at least one tove will burble. It only tells us that if Bungo were not beamish, then no toves would burble. Since Bungo is beamish, this condition doesn't apply, but it doesn't confirm that any tove will burble.\n\n2. **Every tove will burble.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, there is no information that confirms every tove will burble. We cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n3. **Not all toves will burble.**\n   - Again, there is no information that allows us to conclude that not all toves will burble. The given conditions do not provide enough detail to make this determination.\n\n4. **Only toves will burble.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that only toves will burble. Other entities like borogoves or raths could also potentially burble, but we have no specific information about them.\n\n5. **Rafin will burble.**\n   - There is no information about whether Rafin will burble or not. The only thing we know about Rafin is that either Bungo or Rafin is uffish, but this does not relate to burbling.\n\n6. **No toves will burble.**\n   - As previously discussed, since Bungo is beamish, the condition that no toves will burble does not apply. Thus, we cannot conclude that no toves will burble.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the statements can be definitively concluded as true from the given information.\n\n**Final Answer: None of the statements must be true in this situation.**",

It could be a tove, borogove, or rath. Thus, we cannot conclude this definitively.\n\n4. **Rafin and Bungo are beamish.**\n   - Similar to the previous points, we do not have enough information to determine the beamish status of both Rafin and Bungo.\n\n5. **Rafin is beamish.**\n   - As with Rafin's beamish status, it depends on the condition involving a borogove snicker-snacking Rafin and raths chortling at Rafin.

This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, we lack specific information about Zindle's behavior regarding whiffling. This statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n3. **Zindle won't whiffle.**\n   - Again, we don't have sufficient information to determine that Zindle definitely won't whiffle. This statement also cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n4. **Not all toves will whiffle and Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - We know that not all toves will whiffle, but we also know that Zindle is mimsy. Therefore, this statement is false because it claims Zindle isn't mimsy.\n\n5. **Not all toves will whiffle but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - This statement correctly asserts that not all toves will whiffle and acknowledges that Zindle is indeed mimsy. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - We don't have enough information to confirm that both Zindle and Rafin will whiffle. Additionally, since Rafin is not a tove, we cannot assume anything about his whiffling behavior based on the given information. This statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5.

Only toves gimbled.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"Zindle and Rafin gimbled.\"\n- From the information, we know that only toves gimbled. However, we do not have specific information about whether Zindle and Rafin are toves. Therefore, we cannot conclude that both Zindle and Rafin gimbled based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"A borogove is uffish just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n- We know that a borogove is uffish regardless of whether toves snicker-snacked Zindle or not. The condition \"just in case\" implies a necessary and sufficient condition, which is not supported by the given information. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"A borogove is uffish just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n- We know that a borogove is uffish. The condition \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is given as true. However, the \"just in case\" part suggests a bidirectional implication, which is not supported by the given information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Zindle and Bungo gimbled.\"\n- Similar to Statement 1, we know only toves gimbled, but we do not have specific information about whether Zindle and Bungo are toves. Therefore, we cannot conclude that both Zindle and Bungo gimbled based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Zindle didn't gimble.\"\n- Since only toves gimbled, and we do not have specific information about whether Zindle is a tove, we cannot definitively say that Zindle did not gimble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Zindle gimbled.\"\n- Again, since only toves gimbled, and we do not have specific information about whether Zindle is a tove, we cannot definitively say that Zindle did gimble.

No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n5. A borogove will burble and only toves are mimsy.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This statement could be true or false based on the given information. The condition \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" suggests that if some borogoves did snicker-snack Rafin, it doesn't necessarily mean they are mimsy. However, it does not definitively confirm that at least one borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n2. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given condition \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" If no borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then the condition would imply that no borogoves are mimsy, which is consistent with the fact that only toves are mimsy. However, since we know there are borogoves, and the condition is about \"not all,\" this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n3. **Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - The problem does not provide any information about Rafin snicker-snacking anything. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - Given the condition \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin,\" this statement aligns with the condition. Since only toves are mimsy, and the condition implies that for borogoves to not be mimsy, not all of them can have snicker-snacked Rafin, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, there is no information provided about Rafin snicker-snacking anything, so this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n6. **Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This statement directly contradicts the condition \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" If every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, it would imply that all borogoves are mimsy, which is impossible because only toves are mimsy. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**",

However, we have no direct information about whether Zindle chortled at Bungo or whether raths chortled at Rafin. Therefore, this cannot be determined as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin unless not all raths chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This statement implies that if Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then not all raths chortled at Bungo. We know no raths chortled at Zindle, but we don't have information about raths chortling at Bungo or Rafin. Thus, this cannot be determined as necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every rath chortled at Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - The first part contradicts the given information that no raths chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin or not all raths chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is a disjunction. Since we know no raths chortled at Zindle, it doesn't provide information about raths chortling at Bungo. However, since we don't have information about Zindle chortling at Rafin, this statement could be true because it only requires one part of the disjunction to be true. Given the lack of specific information, this statement can be considered potentially true.\n\n5. **No raths chortled at Zindle just in case Rafin chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know no raths chortled at Zindle, and we also know Rafin chortled at Bungo.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No borogoves are beamish if and only if Rafin chortled at Bungo.\n3. If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then every rath chortled at Rafin only if every rath is beamish.\n4. A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4, we know that Rafin did chortle at Bungo because \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\"\n- Since Rafin chortled at Bungo, from point 2, no borogoves are beamish.\n- From point 3, since Rafin was chortled at by a borogove, we need to consider the condition involving Zindle. However, the exact status of Zindle chortling at Rafin isn't directly provided, so we'll focus on what we can deduce about the beamishness of borogoves and raths.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **No borogoves are beamish.**\n   - This is directly supported by the analysis above. Since Rafin chortled at Bungo, no borogoves are beamish.\n   \n2. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - There is no direct information about Zindle's beamishness. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as true based on the given information.\n   \n3. **Only borogoves are beamish.**\n   - We have established that no borogoves are beamish, so this statement is false.\n   \n4. **A borogove is beamish.**\n   - Since no borogoves are beamish, this statement is false.\n   \n5. **Only borogoves are beamish and not all borogoves are beamish.**\n   - This statement is false for the same reason as statement 3; no borogoves are beamish.\n   \n6. **Every borogove is beamish.**\n   - This statement is false because no borogoves are beamish.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**1.

It tells us that if Zindle has the property of being mimsy, then Bungo will burble. However, we don't have information about whether Zindle is actually mimsy.\n\n4. **Rafin isn't beamish and Bungo is a rath.**\n   - Rafin does not have the property of being beamish, and Bungo is categorized as a rath.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - There is no direct information stating that Zindle will burble. The only condition for Bungo to burble is if Zindle is mimsy, but we do not know if Zindle is mimsy. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **Zindle and Bungo will burble.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, we lack sufficient information to conclude that both Zindle and Bungo will burble. We only know that Bungo will burble if Zindle is mimsy, but we don't know if Zindle is mimsy.\n\n3. **Bungo didn't galumph over Bungo.**\n   - Since Bungo is a rath and Bungo galumphed over every rath, it logically follows that Bungo cannot galumph over itself. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n   - Again, we lack information to conclude that either Zindle or Rafin will burble. There is no direct link between Rafin's properties and the act of burbling.\n\n5. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - We do not have enough information to definitively say that Zindle won't burble. The condition for Bungo to burble depends on Zindle being mimsy, but we don't know if Zindle is mimsy.\n\n6. **Bungo galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - As previously discussed, since Bungo is a rath and Bungo galumphed over every rath, Bungo cannot galumph over itself. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. Bungo didn't galumph over Bungo.**",

Every borogove is uffish.\n6. Every borogove gyred just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Zindle is uffish**: This means Zindle could be either a borogove or a tove since both can be uffish.\n- **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo**: This doesn't provide direct information about Bungo's type or actions.\n- **No toves chortled at Rafin**: This implies that if Rafin is a tove, then no other toves chortled at him.\n- **Every borogove is uffish**: This means all borogoves are uffish, but not all uffish entities are necessarily borogoves.\n- **Every borogove gyred just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo**: This conditional statement means that if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then every borogove gyred.

However, since we don't have information about whether Zindle will burble or not, this condition does not provide direct information about chortling at Zindle.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the given information:\n\n1. **A borogove chortled at Zindle.**\n   - False, because \"No borogoves chortled at Zindle.\"\n\n2. **Not all borogoves chortled at Zindle.**\n   - True, because no borogoves chortled at Zindle, so it is certainly true that not all did.\n\n3. **Zindle chortled at every borogove.**\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle chortling at borogoves, so we cannot conclude this.\n\n4. **Every borogove chortled at Zindle.**\n   - False, because \"No borogoves chortled at Zindle.\"\n\n5. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - There is no information provided about whether Zindle will burble or not, so we cannot conclude this.\n\n6. **Zindle chortled at a borogove.**\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle chortling at borogoves, so we cannot conclude this.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**2.

However, we have no direct information about Zindle chortling at Bungo or the condition under which he does so. Therefore, this cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **A rath chortled at Zindle only if Bungo gimbled.**\n   - We know that every rath gimbled, but there is no information linking a rath chortling at Zindle with Bungo gimbled. Thus, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n3. **Every rath gimbled but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We know that every rath gimbled, but it is stated that Bungo chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false because it contradicts the given information.\n\n4. **Not all raths gimbled just in case Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - Since every rath gimbled, the first part of this statement is false. The second part (Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo) is also not supported by the given information. Hence, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n5. **Every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We know that every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **If a rath chortled at Zindle, then Bungo gimbled.**\n   - We know that every rath gimbled, but there is no information about whether a rath chortled at Zindle or what happens if they do.

It involves conditions about mimsiness and self-snicker-snacking, which aren't directly relevant to our analysis of toves and borogoves.\n\n4. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Rafin is a tove.**\n   - This tells us that Rafin is a tove and some borogove chortled at him.

However, we do not have enough information to determine whether Rafin is a tove or not. Since Rafin is uffish and a borogove is uffish, Rafin could be a borogove, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of being a tove.

It only states that a tove snicker-snacked every rath. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - We know that \"a tove snicker-snacked every rath.\" This directly contradicts the statement that no toves snicker-snacked every rath. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - The information only specifies that \"a tove snicker-snacked every rath,\" which means at least one tove snicker-snacked every rath. It does not imply that every tove did so. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Similar to the previous analysis, the information only confirms that at least one tove snicker-snacked every rath. It does not imply that every tove did so. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - Since \"a tove snicker-snacked every rath,\" it logically follows that a tove snicker-snacked at least one rath. This statement is true.\n\n6. **No toves snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This directly contradicts the fact that \"a tove snicker-snacked every rath.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5.

Since Rafin isn't a tove, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n2. If Rafin were a rath, then according to the condition \"Rafin is a tove unless a rath is beamish,\" it would imply that no rath can be beamish because Rafin cannot be both a rath and a tove simultaneously.

However, the given condition only states that if a rath snicker-snacks another rath, then the second rath will snicker-snack the first. It does not imply mutual snicker-snacking for all pairs of raths. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - Since there is at least one rath, and the condition allows for a rath to snicker-snack another rath, this statement must be true. At least one instance of a rath snicker-snacking another rath can occur.\n\n3. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This would mean that there exists a single rath that snicker-snacked all other raths. The given information does not provide enough detail to confirm this universally for all raths. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.**\n   - This aligns with the given condition: \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This statement contradicts the possibility that a rath could snicker-snack every other rath. Given the lack of specific constraints against this, we cannot definitively say this is true based solely on the provided information. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Every rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This means that for every rath, there is at least one other rath that it snicker-snacked.

We cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, we do not have sufficient information to determine if Zindle is mimsy or not.\n\n3. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - Again, we lack specific information regarding Zindle's mimsiness.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.**\n   - No direct information is provided about the mimsiness of Zindle and Bungo.\n\n5. **Rafin is a rath.**\n   - Given that \"not all raths galumphed over Rafin,\" it suggests that Rafin could be a rath because if Rafin were a tove or a borogove, the statement would not make sense in the context of raths galumphing over other raths. However, this is an assumption based on the structure of the statement rather than explicit confirmation.\n\n6. **Rafin isn't a rath.**\n   - This contradicts the analysis for statement 5. Since Rafin is involved in a condition related to raths, it is more likely that Rafin is a rath.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logically consistent statement that can be derived from the given information is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5. Rafin is a rath.**",

Everything is exclusively a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. No raths galumphed over a rath.\n4. Every rath galumphed over Rafin.\n5. Rafin isn't a tove.\n6. If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Bungo isn't a tove.\n- The condition \"If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo\" does not directly provide information about whether Bungo is a tove or not. However, it suggests that Bungo could be involved in actions that are not exclusive to toves. Since we have no direct contradiction or confirmation regarding Bungo being a tove, we cannot definitively conclude this statement as true based solely on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Rafin is a tove.\n- It is explicitly stated that \"Rafin isn't a tove.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.\n- This statement is contradictory because it asserts both that a borogove will burble and that no borogoves will burble. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Rafin is a rath.\n- We know Rafin isn't a tove, so Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath. However, since every rath galumphed over Rafin, Rafin cannot be a rath (because no raths galumphed over a rath). Therefore, Rafin must be a borogove, making this statement false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Bungo is a tove.\n- Similar to Statement 1, the given information does not directly confirm or deny whether Bungo is a tove. The conditional statement involving Bungo does not provide enough information to determine Bungo's type conclusively.\n\n#### Statement 6: Rafin isn't a rath.\n- As analyzed in Statement 4, Rafin cannot be a rath because every rath galumphed over Rafin, which would contradict the rule that no raths galumphed over a rath. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: Rafin isn't a rath.**",

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every borogove snicker-snacked every tove.\n4. Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all toves chortled at Rafin.\n5. Not all toves gyred just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.\n- From condition 3, we know that every borogove snicker-snacked every tove. Therefore, it is true that there is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\n- The information does not provide any details about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. It only states that borogoves snicker-snacked toves. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.\n- Similar to Statement 2, there is no information about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. Hence, this statement also cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\n- Again, there is no information about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\n- As with the previous statements, there is no information about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\n- There is no information about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that can be concluded as true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 1: There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.**\n\nThis is because the given condition explicitly states that every borogove snicker-snacked every tove, which directly supports Statement 1.",

This means that if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then the condition \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\" implies \"not all toves will whiffle.\"\n- Point 7 tells us that not all borogoves will whiffle.\n- Point 8 tells us that Bungo isn't mimsy, which doesn't directly affect our logic about snicker-snacking or whiffling.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - There is no direct information about whether Zindle will whiffle or not based on the given conditions. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts point 5, which states that every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.

Therefore, we cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n2. **No borogoves gimbled.**\n   - From point 4, if not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then no borogove gimbled. Since it is stated that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, it follows that no borogove gimbled.\n\n3. **A borogove gimbled.**\n   - Contradicts option 2, so this cannot be true.\n\n4. **Only borogoves gimbled.**\n   - Contradicts option 2, so this cannot be true.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin gimbled.**\n   - The information does not provide any direct statement about whether Zindle or Rafin gimbled. Therefore, we cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n6. **Every borogove gimbled.**\n   - Contradicts option 2, so this cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 2.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No toves galumphed over every borogove.\n3. Rafin galumphed over every borogove.\n4. Only toves gyred or every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n5. No toves snicker-snacked Zindle only if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Rafin galumphed over every borogove**: This means Rafin cannot be a borogove because a borogove cannot galumph over itself. Therefore, Rafin must be either a tove or a rath.\n- **No toves galumphed over every borogove**: Since Rafin galumphed over every borogove, Rafin cannot be a tove. Thus, Rafin must be a rath.\n- **Only toves gyred or every tove galumphed over Rafin**: If Rafin is a rath, then the condition \"every tove galumphed over Rafin\" must hold true for the second part of the disjunction to be false. However, since Rafin is a rath, it doesn't affect whether toves gyred or not directly.\n- **No toves snicker-snacked Zindle only if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin**: This implies that if Rafin did snicker-snack Rafin, then some toves could have snicker-snacked Zindle. But if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, no toves snicker-snacked Zindle. This doesn't provide direct information about gyring or the type of Zindle.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Zindle gyred**: There is no direct information about Zindle gyring from the given conditions.\n2. **Rafin isn't a tove**: True, as we deduced that Rafin must be a rath.\n3. **Rafin is a tove**: False, as Rafin is a rath.\n4. **Zindle didn't gyre**: There is no direct information about Zindle gyring from the given conditions.\n5. **Rafin gyred**: There is no direct information about Rafin gyring from the given conditions.\n6. **Zindle and Rafin gyred**: There is no direct information about Zindle or Rafin gyring from the given conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all borogoves are beamish.\n3. Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.\n4. If not all borogoves are mimsy, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo is beamish.\n5. If Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.\n6. Zindle isn't beamish.\n7. Rafin isn't uffish.\n8. Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n9. Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Zindle:** Since Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle, Zindle cannot be a rath because every rath snicker-snacks Zindle. Therefore, Zindle must be either a tove or a borogove.\n- **Rafin:** We don't have direct information about what Rafin is, but we know that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n- **Bungo:** No specific information about Bungo's type or characteristics is provided directly, except for the conditional statements involving Bungo.\n\n### Conditional Statements:\n- **If not all borogoves are mimsy, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo is beamish.**\n  - This means if some borogoves are not mimsy, then for a borogove to snicker-snack Rafin, Bungo must be beamish.\n- **If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.**\n  - This means if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then for a borogove to snicker-snack Bungo, no borogoves can be beamish.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that Zindle is not a rath and Zindle isn't beamish, we need to determine which statement must be true based on the provided conditions.\n\n1. **Zindle is a rath.** - False, as Zindle cannot be a rath.\n2. **Zindle is mimsy.** - Cannot be determined directly from the given information.\n3. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.** - Cannot be determined directly from the given information.\n4. **Zindle isn't mimsy.** - Cannot be determined directly from the given information.\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are mimsy.** - Cannot be determined directly from the given information.\n6. **Zindle isn't a rath.** - True, as Zindle cannot be a rath.\n\nThus, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 6.

We know Bungo, a rath, is not mimsy, but there might be other raths that are mimsy.

However, since Zindle was snicker-snacked by a borogove, and there is no direct link between being snicker-snacked and being mimsy, we cannot conclude that Zindle is mimsy.\n\n4. **No raths are mimsy.**\n   - This cannot be concluded as true because while Bungo is not mimsy, there is no information stating that all raths are not mimsy.\n\n5. **Only raths are mimsy.**\n   - This cannot be true because we know that Bungo, a rath, is not mimsy, and there is no information suggesting that only raths can be mimsy.\n\n6. **Not all raths are mimsy.**\n   - This must be true because Bungo, who is a rath, is not mimsy.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. No borogoves galumphed over a tove.\n4. Bungo galumphed over a tove.\n5. If Zindle won't burble, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since Bungo galumphed over a tove, Bungo cannot be a borogove (because no borogoves galumphed over a tove). Therefore, Bungo must be either a tove or a rath.\n- The fifth point is a conditional statement: \"If Zindle won't burble, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\" This can be broken down into two parts:\n  - If Zindle won't burble, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n  - If every rath chortled at Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Bungo isn't a borogove.**\n   - True, because Bungo galumphed over a tove, and no borogoves did so.\n\n2. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine whether Zindle will burble or not based on the given conditions alone.\n\n3. **Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - False, as explained above, Bungo cannot be a borogove.\n\n4. **If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This is a contradiction. It states that if Bungo isn't a borogove, it must be a borogove, which is logically impossible.\n\n5. **Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This is also a contradiction. It suggests that for Bungo not being a borogove, Bungo must be a borogove, which is logically impossible.\n\n6. **Zindle and Bungo will burble.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine whether both Zindle and Bungo will burble.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**1.

Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **Every tove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - Again, the information only tells us that every rath was galumphed over by some tove, not that every tove galumphed over every rath.

However, this does not provide direct information about whether Bungo is beamish or not; it only sets up a conditional relationship.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No toves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This cannot be true because Bungo snicker-snacked every tove, which means every tove was the object of Bungo's snicker-snacking, not the subject.\n\n2. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This is irrelevant since the information given does not discuss toves snicker-snacking Bungo, only Bungo snicker-snacking toves.\n\n3. **Bungo snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - This must be true because Bungo snicker-snacked every tove, so he certainly snicker-snacked at least one tove.\n\n4. **Every tove snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This is not supported by the information given. The information states that Bungo snicker-snacked every tove, not the other way around.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - Similar to statement 4, this is not supported by the information given. There is no indication that any tove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n6. **Bungo is beamish.**\n   - This cannot be definitively concluded from the given information. While the conditional statement involving raths and Bungo being beamish is present, it does not confirm Bungo's beamishness directly.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement that must be true is:\n3. Bungo snicker-snacked a tove.",

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked every rath.\n4. Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle.\n5. Rafin isn't a tove.\n6. A rath is uffish.\n7. Rafin isn't a tove (repeated).\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and Rafin isn't a tove, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n- A rath is uffish, so if Rafin is a rath, then Rafin is uffish.\n- Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle, which means Zindle cannot be a tove because toves snicker-snack other entities according to the rules provided. Therefore, Zindle must be either a borogove or a rath.\n- If Zindle is a rath, then Zindle is uffish since all raths are uffish.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Zindle isn't uffish.**\n   - This can't be determined directly from the information given. Zindle could be a rath and thus uffish, or Zindle could be a borogove and not necessarily uffish. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A rath snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath is uffish.**\n   - We know a rath is uffish, but we don't have enough information to conclude that a rath snicker-snacked Zindle. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - If Zindle is a rath, then Zindle is uffish. However, Zindle could also be a borogove, in which case Zindle might not be uffish. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle and a rath is uffish.**\n   - We know Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle and that a rath is uffish. This statement combines two facts that are both true based on the given information. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are uffish.**\n   - Rafin could be a borogove and not necessarily uffish. Zindle could be a borogove as well and not necessarily uffish. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Zindle is uffish and a rath snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know Zindle could be a rath and thus uffish, but we don't have enough information to conclude that a rath snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4.

Every borogove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked every tove.\n5. No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n6. Every tove chortled at Bungo only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n7. No toves snicker-snacked Zindle if and only if a rath gimbled.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No toves galumphed over a borogove.\n- This contradicts the given condition that \"there is a borogove that every tove galumphed over.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A tove galumphed over every borogove.\n- The given condition states that \"there is a borogove that every tove galumphed over,\" but it does not specify that every tove galumphed over every borogove. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every tove galumphed over every borogove.\n- Similar to Statement 2, the given condition does not support this claim. It only mentions that every tove galumphed over a specific borogove, not every borogove. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every tove galumphed over a borogove.\n- This aligns with the given condition that \"there is a borogove that every tove galumphed over.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all toves will whiffle and every tove will whiffle.\n- There is no information provided about \"whiffling\" in the given conditions. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of this statement based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: No toves galumphed over every borogove.\n- This statement is not necessarily true because the given condition does not exclude the possibility that some toves might have galumphed over every borogove.

However, since Rafin chortled at a tove, we need to consider the implications based on Rafin's identity.\n\n4. **If Rafin is a tove, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This conditional statement tells us about the behavior of raths and borogoves regarding Bungo, contingent on Rafin being a tove.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A tove chortled at every tove that chortled at it.**\n   - This is directly stated in the problem, so it must be true.\n\n2. **Every tove chortled at every tove.**\n   - The problem does not provide enough information to conclude that every tove chortled at every other tove. It only states that if a tove chortles at another tove, the second tove will chortle back. There is no guarantee that all toves chortle at all others.\n\n3. **Every tove chortled at a tove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true because the problem does not specify that every tove must chortle at some other tove; it only specifies the reciprocal nature of chortling between toves.\n\n4. **A tove chortled at a tove.**\n   - Since Rafin chortled at a tove, and Rafin could be a tove, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **A tove chortled at every tove.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, the problem does not provide enough information to conclude that any single tove chortled at every other tove.\n\n6. **No toves chortled at every tove.**\n   - This cannot be concluded from the given information. We do not have enough details to assert that no tove chortled at every other tove.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 1: A tove chortled at every tove that chortled at it.\n- Statement 4: A tove chortled at a tove.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**Statements 1 and 4 must be true.**",

If Rafin is a tove, then every rath galumphed over Rafin only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: There is a tove that every tove galumphed over.\n- From condition 4, we know that every tove galumphed over another tove that galumphed over it. This implies a chain of galumphing among toves. However, it does not necessarily mean that there is a single tove that every other tove galumphed over. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every tove galumphed over every tove.\n- Condition 4 states that every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it, but it doesn't imply that every tove galumphed over every other tove. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No toves galumphed over every tove.\n- This statement contradicts condition 4, which implies that there is a chain of galumphing among toves. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A tove galumphed over a tove.\n- According to condition 4, every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it, meaning there is at least one instance where a tove galumphed over another tove. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A tove galumphed over every tove.\n- Similar to statement 2, condition 4 does not imply that a single tove galumphed over every other tove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No toves galumphed over a tove.\n- This statement directly contradicts condition 4, which states that every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**Statement 4: A tove galumphed over a tove.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Therefore, we cannot conclude that both Zindle and Rafin gyred.\n\n2. **Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, we lack sufficient information about the types of Zindle and Bungo to determine if they gyred.\n\n3. **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n   - Since we know a rath galumphed over Zindle, and raths are not necessarily toves, it's possible that Zindle could be a rath or a borogove. If Zindle is a rath or a borogove, it doesn't gyre because only toves gyre. Thus, this statement might be true, but we need more specific information about Zindle's type.\n\n4. **Zindle gyred.**\n   - This would imply Zindle is a tove. However, since a rath galumphed over Zindle, Zindle could also be a rath or a borogove, which do not gyre. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - We know a rath galumphed over Zindle, but we don't know if Zindle itself is a rath. Being uffish is a characteristic of raths, but we can't conclude Zindle is a rath just from this information.\n\n6. **A rath is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - This statement is true because it combines two facts: all raths are uffish, and a rath did indeed galumph over Zindle.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer:** 6.

It only mentions that every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n4. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - There is no information about Zindle's actions regarding whiffling. Thus, we cannot determine if this statement is true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n6. **No borogoves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This also contradicts the given information that every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2.

Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - We know Zindle is mimsy, which implies no toves will burble. Since Zindle is not specified as a tove, we cannot conclude whether Zindle will burble or not. Thus, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n3. **A borogove is uffish just in case every borogove is mimsy.**\n   - The condition for a borogove being uffish is that no toves will burble, which is equivalent to a borogove being mimsy. However, it does not require every borogove to be mimsy. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - Since Zindle is mimsy, no toves will burble. If Zindle is not a tove, then Zindle won't burble. Given that Zindle is mimsy, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n   - Both Zindle and Rafin are mimsy, implying no toves will burble. If neither Zindle nor Rafin is a tove, they won't burble. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **A borogove is uffish just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - The condition for a borogove being uffish is that no toves will burble, which is equivalent to a borogove being mimsy. It does not depend on whether all borogoves are mimsy or not. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1.

A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 4 must be true.",

Therefore, this statement is false because every tove is chortled at by every other tove.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at every tove.**\n   - This statement is also false because it is explicitly stated that every tove chortled at every tove.\n\n5. **A tove chortled at every tove.**\n   - This statement is true because it aligns with the given information that every tove chortled at every tove.\n\n6. **No toves chortled at a tove that chortled at it.**\n   - This statement is false because if every tove chortled at every tove, then every tove would have chortled at a tove that chortled at it.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5.

Since we don't know what Zindle is, we can't conclude that both Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.

Since there is at least one borogove and one tove, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **A tove galumphed over every borogove that galumphed over it.**\n   - This is directly stated in the problem, so it must be true.\n\n3. **No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - This contradicts the given condition that every tove galumphed over every borogove that galumphed over it. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - The problem does not specify that every tove galumphed over every borogove without the condition that the borogove galumphed over the tove first. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - Similar to statement 4, this is not necessarily true because the condition only applies when a borogove galumphed over a tove first.\n\n6. **A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - This is similar to statement 4 and is not necessarily true for the same reason.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 1: A tove galumphed over a borogove.\n- Statement 2: A tove galumphed over every borogove that galumphed over it.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 1 and 2 must be true.",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No toves chortled at a tove.\n3. Rafin is a tove unless a rath galumphed over Bungo.\n4. If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n5. If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin is a tove only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n6. Bungo chortled at Bungo and every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Bungo chortled at Bungo**: This means Bungo cannot be a tove because no toves chortle at a tove. Therefore, Bungo must be either a borogove or a rath.\n- **Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle**: This does not directly tell us what Zindle is, but it tells us that if Zindle were a rath, it would contradict the exclusivity since everything is exclusively a tove, borogove, or rath. Thus, Zindle cannot be a rath.\n- **Rafin is a tove unless a rath galumphed over Bungo**: Since we don't have information about whether a rath galumphed over Bungo, we need to consider both possibilities for Rafin.\n- **If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin**: This statement doesn't give us direct information about Rafin's status but suggests a conditional relationship between borogoves' actions towards Bungo and Rafin.\n- **If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin is a tove only if every borogove chortled at Bungo**: Since every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, we can infer that raths are active in their actions. However, this does not directly inform us about Bungo being snicker-snacked by raths.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis:\n- **Bungo cannot be a tove** because Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n- **Zindle cannot be a rath** because every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n- The status of Rafin as a tove depends on whether a rath galumphed over Bungo, which is not specified.\n\nThus, the statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- **Bungo isn't a tove**.\n- **Zindle isn't a tove**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n- 2.

Therefore, for Zindle to be beamish, Zindle must be a borogove. However, there is no direct information confirming Zindle's type. Thus, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **Only borogoves are beamish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This statement combines two pieces of information: \"only borogoves are beamish\" (which is true) and \"no toves galumphed over Bungo\" (also true). Since both parts are confirmed by the given information, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - Given that only borogoves are beamish, Bungo being beamish implies Bungo is a borogove. However, the condition \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish\" does not logically follow from the given information. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **If Bungo galumphed over Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - The premise \"Bungo galumphed over Bungo\" contradicts the given information that Bungo did not galumph over Rafin (and thus not over Bungo). Therefore, this conditional statement is irrelevant and cannot be evaluated as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - As previously discussed, only borogoves are beamish. There is no information confirming that Zindle and Rafin are borogoves. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Not all borogoves are beamish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - The first part, \"not all borogoves are beamish,\" contradicts the given information that only borogoves are beamish. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Option 2: Only borogoves are beamish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n\nFinal Answer: Option 2.",

If even one tove does not burble, then the borogove is mimsy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No toves chortled at Rafin and every tove gyred.**\n   - This statement combines two pieces of information given directly: \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" and \"Every tove gyred.\" Since both parts are directly stated, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - There is no direct information about whether Zindle will burble or not. The information only states what borogoves do (chortle at Zindle) and their condition for being mimsy. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle will burble.\n\n3. **Rafin will burble.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, there is no information provided about Rafin's actions or conditions related to burbling. Thus, we cannot conclude that Rafin will burble.\n\n4. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - As with the previous points, there is no information about Zindle's actions regarding burbling. We cannot conclude that Zindle won't burble.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n   - Again, there is no information about either Zindle or Rafin burbling. We cannot conclude that both will burble.\n\n6. **Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all toves gyred.**\n   - This statement suggests a conditional relationship between Rafin chortling at Rafin and the gyring of toves. However, since it is given that every tove gyred, the condition \"not all toves gyred\" is false. Therefore, the statement is not necessarily true because it hinges on a condition that is not met.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**1.

Since every rath chortled at Zindle, it follows that every rath also chortled at Rafin (as per the condition: \"If a rath chortled at Zindle, then every rath chortled at Rafin\").\n2.

Everything is a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. There is a borogove that every borogove snicker-snacked.\n4. Every tove is uffish or not all toves will whiffle.\n5. If Bungo is a borogove, then Zindle isn't a borogove.\n6. Rafin gimbled and every tove will whiffle.\n7. Zindle isn't mimsy and Bungo isn't mimsy.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.\"\n- This statement is contradictory because it asserts both that some borogoves will burble and none will burble. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"No toves are uffish.\"\n- From the given information, we know that every tove is uffish or not all toves will whiffle. Since every tove will whiffle (from point 6), it implies that every tove must be uffish. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Only toves are uffish.\"\n- We have established that every tove is uffish. However, the information does not exclude the possibility that other types (borogoves or raths) could also be uffish. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Not all toves are uffish.\"\n- As previously analyzed, since every tove will whiffle, every tove must be uffish. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Zindle will whiffle.\"\n- The information states that every tove will whiffle. However, it does not specify what Zindle is. If Zindle is a tove, then Zindle will whiffle. But if Zindle is a borogove or a rath, we do not have enough information to conclude that Zindle will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Every tove is uffish.\"\n- As analyzed earlier, since every tove will whiffle, and the condition states that every tove is uffish or not all toves will whiffle, it follows that every tove must be uffish. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: Every tove is uffish.**",

However, the given condition only states that if a borogove chortled at another, the second borogove chortled back. It does not imply that every borogove chortled at every other borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No borogoves chortled at every borogove.**\n   - This statement is the negation of the first statement. Since we cannot conclude from the given information that every borogove chortled at every other borogove, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true either because it is possible that some borogoves did chortle at every other borogove.\n\n3. **A borogove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - Given that every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it, if there is at least one pair of borogoves where one chortled at the other, then this statement must be true. Since there is at least one borogove, and the condition implies mutual chortling, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Every borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, this statement is too strong. The given condition does not support that every borogove chortled at every other borogove, only that if a borogove chortled at another, the second borogove chortled back. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.**\n   - This statement aligns directly with the given condition: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Every borogove chortled at a borogove.**\n   - This statement suggests that each borogove chortled at at least one other borogove. While the given condition supports mutual chortling, it does not guarantee that every borogove chortled at at least one other. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 3: A borogove chortled at a borogove.\n- Statement 5: A borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 3 and 5 must be true.",

It only tells us what toves did to Zindle, not vice versa. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as necessarily true.\n\n2. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know that every tove snicker-snacked Zindle. This means that all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, there is no information indicating that Zindle snicker-snacked any toves. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as necessarily true.\n\n4. **Zindle gyred.**\n   - According to the information, \"Zindle gyred unless Zindle isn't a borogove.\" If Zindle is a borogove, then Zindle gyred. Since it is stated that there is at least one of each type (toves, borogoves, and raths), Zindle could indeed be a borogove. Therefore, Zindle gyred. This statement must be true.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know that every tove snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **A tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - Since every tove snicker-snacked Zindle, it follows that at least one tove snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 4 and 6 must be true.",

Therefore, if an entity is a rath, it must also be uffish.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This tells us something about the interactions between entities, but it doesn't directly affect the categorization or the uffishness of entities.\n\n4. **A rath galumphed over Zindle and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - Again, this provides interaction details but does not directly impact the categorization or uffishness.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No raths are uffish.**\n   - This contradicts the given condition that every rath is uffish.

Thus, we cannot conclude this with certainty.\n\n4. **A rath is uffish.**\n   - Given that every rath is uffish, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are uffish.**\n   - There is no direct information linking Zindle and Rafin to being raths or uffish. Thus, we cannot conclude this with certainty.\n\n6. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, there is no direct information linking Zindle to being a rath or uffish.

If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Rafin won't whiffle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Statement 2**: \"A borogove will whiffle\" and \"A borogove is uffish\" are directly stated as facts.\n- **Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Bungo** is also a fact.\n- The other conditions involve conditional relationships that need careful examination.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n   - There is no direct information about whether Zindle and Bungo are borogoves or what they do. This cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, there is no direct information about Zindle and Rafin being borogoves or their actions.\n\n3. **A borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.**\n   - This is directly stated in the given information. It must be true.\n\n4. **Zindle won't whiffle.**\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle's actions or type, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - Again, there is no information provided about Zindle's actions or type, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n6. **Every borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.**\n   - The given information states that a borogove is uffish and will whiffle, but it does not specify that every borogove is uffish. Therefore, this statement cannot be conclusively determined as true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3.

We do not have information about all toves.\n\n4. **Bungo chortled at every tove.**\n   - This is false based on the information \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\" Since Bungo is a tove, Bungo did not chortle at itself, which contradicts this statement.\n\n5. **No toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is false because Rafin, a tove, chortled at Bungo.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is true because Rafin, who is a tove, chortled at Bungo.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

Therefore, we can only confirm the first part of the statement as true, but not the second part.\n\n6. **Not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n   - Given that \"no toves chortled at Rafin,\" it logically follows that not all toves chortled at Rafin. This statement must be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 6. Not all toves chortled at Rafin.**",

This implies that Rafin is not a rath (since every rath galumphed over Zindle).\n- **Conditional Whiffle Statement**: The conditional statement about whiffling is complex, but it suggests a dependency on whether Zindle galumphed over Bungo and whether every rath galumphed over Rafin.\n- **Bungo as a Rath**: Since Bungo is a rath, and every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, Bungo also snicker-snacked Zindle.\n- **Rafin Not Galumphing Over Zindle**: Since Rafin did not galumph over Zindle, and every rath galumphed over Zindle, Rafin cannot be a rath.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Zindle will whiffle**: There is no direct information about Zindle whiffing, so this cannot be concluded.\n2. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle**: Similarly, there is no information about Rafin whiffing.\n3. **Zindle won't whiffle**: There is no direct information indicating Zindle won't whiffle.\n4. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle**: Again, no direct information about Rafin whiffing.\n5. **A rath snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle**: True, because every rath snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n6. **Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle**: There is no information about Zindle snicker-snacking Zindle, but we do know a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5.

However, we have no information about whether Zindle can chortle at itself or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **No raths chortled at Zindle just in case no borogoves are beamish.**\n   - We know that every rath chortled at Zindle. Thus, the condition \"no raths chortled at Zindle\" is false. The statement suggests a biconditional relationship, which would imply that if no borogoves are beamish, then no raths chortled at Zindle. Since the latter part is false, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Not all borogoves are beamish and every rath chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We know from the given information that not all borogoves are beamish and every rath chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't beamish.**\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle's beamishness. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle's or Rafin's beamishness. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n6. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle's beamishness. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n3.

Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No raths gyred.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given condition that \"every rath gyred.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **A rath gyred.**\n   - Since every rath gyred, it follows that at least one rath (and indeed all raths) gyrated. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Rafin and Bungo gyred.**\n   - We do not have enough information about whether Rafin and Bungo are raths or not. Rafin being beamish implies he is a borogove, but we don't know if borogoves gyred. Similarly, we don't know what Bungo is. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n6. **Rafin gyred.**\n   - Rafin is a borogove (since only borogoves are beamish). However, we do not have information indicating that borogoves gyred. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4. A rath gyred.**",

Thus, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Since no toves chortled at Bungo, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Bungo chortled at a tove.**\n   - The information does not specify whether Bungo chortled at a tove or not, so we cannot determine the truth of this statement from the given information.\n\n4. **Bungo chortled at every tove.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, the information does not specify whether Bungo chortled at every tove or not, so we cannot determine the truth of this statement from the given information.\n\n5. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Since no toves chortled at Bungo, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Every tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Since no toves chortled at Bungo, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5. Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**",

The given condition only states that every tove snicker-snacks every borogove that snicker-snacked it, not necessarily all borogoves. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n2. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This statement implies that each tove has snicker-snacked at least one borogove. However, the given condition only specifies that a tove will snicker-snack a borogove if that borogove snicker-snacked it first. Without additional information about whether any borogove has snicker-snacked a tove, we cannot conclude that every tove has snicker-snacked a borogove. Thus, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, this statement requires that every tove has snicker-snacked all borogoves.

Hence, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n4. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.**\n   - This statement aligns with the given condition: \"Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This statement suggests that there exists at least one instance where a tove has snicker-snacked a borogove. Given the condition that a tove will snicker-snack a borogove if that borogove snicker-snacked it, and knowing there is at least one borogove, if any borogove snicker-snacked a tove, then this statement would be true. However, without knowing if any borogove has snicker-snacked a tove, we cannot definitively say this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This statement negates the idea that any tove has snicker-snacked all borogoves. Since the given condition does not provide enough information to confirm that no tove has snicker-snacked all borogoves, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. If every rath is beamish, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\n3. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n4. Bungo is a rath.\n5. Not all toves will whiffle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Bungo is a rath**: This is directly stated.\n- **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle**: This means there exists at least one tove that did not snicker-snack Zindle.\n- **Not all toves will whiffle**: This means there exists at least one tove that will not whiffle.\n\nThe conditional statement \"If every rath is beamish, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle\" can be broken down as follows:\n- Let \\( P \\) be \"every rath is beamish\".\n- Let \\( Q \\) be \"every rath chortled at Bungo\".\n- Let \\( R \\) be \"Zindle chortled at Zindle\".\n\nThe statement can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow (Q \\rightarrow R) \\).\n\nSince we don't have specific information about whether every rath is beamish or not, we cannot definitively conclude anything from this conditional statement alone.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Zindle won't whiffle**:\n   - There is no direct information about Zindle's behavior regarding whiffling. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle**:\n   - We know Bungo is a rath, but there is no information about whether Bungo will whiffle. Also, there is no information about Zindle's whiffling behavior. Thus, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and every tove will whiffle**:\n   - The first part is true (\"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\").\n   - However, the second part contradicts the given information (\"not all toves will whiffle\"). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle will whiffle**:\n   - There is no direct information about Zindle's behavior regarding whiffling. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and not all toves will whiffle**:\n   - Both parts of this statement are supported by the given information. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Bungo will whiffle**:\n   - There is no direct information about Bungo's behavior regarding whiffling. Therefore, this cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5.

This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - Again, there is no information provided about Zindle's actions towards Bungo, so we cannot conclude this statement as true.\n\n5. **Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle.**\n   - Since Bungo is a rath and every rath chortled at Zindle, it follows that Bungo did chortle at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - Given that Bungo is a rath and every rath chortled at Zindle, this statement must be true.\n\nFinal Answer: The statement that must be true in this situation is 6.

However, the condition \"Every rath chortled at a rath that chortled at it\" does not directly imply that every rath chortled at every other rath. It only implies mutual chortling between pairs. Therefore, this statement could be true, but we cannot definitively conclude it from the given information alone.\n\n2. **There is a rath that every rath chortled at**:\n   - The given condition does not provide enough information to determine if there is a specific rath that every other rath chortled at. It only states mutual chortling, not universal chortling towards a single rath.\n\n3. **A rath chortled at a rath**:\n   - This is directly supported by the condition \"Every rath chortled at a rath that chortled at it.\" Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **No raths chortled at a rath**:\n   - This contradicts the given condition \"Every rath chortled at a rath that chortled at it.\" Hence, this statement must be false.\n\n5. **A rath chortled at every rath**:\n   - The given condition does not support this statement. It only indicates mutual chortling, not that a single rath chortled at every other rath.\n\n6. **Every rath chortled at every rath**:\n   - Similar to the previous statement, the given condition does not support this.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement based on the provided conditions.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is exclusively a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. A borogove chortled at Rafin.\n4. Every borogove chortled at every rath that chortled at every tove.\n5. Zindle is uffish (this detail seems irrelevant to the chortling logic).\n6. It is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo, meaning Bungo did chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\nLet's evaluate each statement against the given conditions:\n\n1. **Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This statement suggests a conditional relationship between Rafin chortling at Rafin and a borogove chortling at Bungo. However, we have no direct information about whether Rafin chortled at Rafin or whether a borogove chortled at Bungo. Therefore, this cannot be determined as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n2. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know a borogove chortled at Rafin, but we don't have information about whether Rafin chortled at Bungo. Thus, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n3. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know a borogove chortled at Rafin and Bungo chortled at Bungo. Both parts of this statement are supported by the given information, making this statement true.\n\n4. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - This means a borogove chortled at Rafin and Rafin did chortle at Bungo. While we know a borogove chortled at Rafin, we do not have information confirming that Rafin chortled at Bungo. Hence, this cannot be determined as true.\n\n5. **Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This statement involves a conditional relationship similar to the first one. We lack information about Rafin chortling at Rafin and the behavior of all borogoves towards Bungo. Therefore, this cannot be determined as true.\n\n6. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know a borogove chortled at Rafin, but we also know Bungo did chortle at Bungo. The second part of this statement contradicts the given information, making this statement false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3. A borogove chortled at Rafin and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n\nThis statement aligns with the provided facts without introducing any unsupported assumptions.",

Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **A rath chortled at Rafin.**\n   - The information does not provide any direct evidence that a rath chortled at Rafin. It only states that a tove chortled at a rath that chortled at it, which doesn't necessarily involve Rafin.\n\n3. **Rafin chortled at every rath.**\n   - We only know that Rafin chortled at Bungo, but we don't have information about Rafin chortling at other raths. Thus, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **No raths chortled at Rafin.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, there is no information indicating whether any rath chortled at Rafin. Hence, this cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **Every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n   - Again, there is no information supporting this claim. We only know about Bungo and Rafin's interaction.\n\n6. **Not all raths chortled at Rafin.**\n   - Since we only know about Bungo and Rafin's interaction, and there is no information about other raths chortling at Rafin, this statement cannot be conclusively determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement that must be true is:\n1.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every borogove is uffish.\n4. No toves galumphed over Bungo.\n5. Zindle is not uffish.\n6. If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since no toves galumphed over Bungo, we know that Bungo cannot be a tove (otherwise, the statement would contradict itself). Therefore, Bungo must be either a borogove or a rath.\n- Zindle is not uffish, which means Zindle cannot be a borogove (since every borogove is uffish). Thus, Zindle must be either a tove or a rath.\n- The conditional statement about Zindle and Rafin can be broken down as follows: \"If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" This statement is complex, but it implies a relationship between Zindle, Rafin, and the actions of toves and borogoves.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Rafin is uffish.**\n   - There is no direct information about Rafin being uffish or not. Rafin could be a borogove (and thus uffish) or a tove/rath (not necessarily uffish). This statement does not have to be true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin are uffish.**\n   - We already established that Zindle is not uffish. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Zindle and Bungo are uffish.**\n   - Zindle is not uffish, so this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Zindle is a borogove.**\n   - Zindle cannot be a borogove because every borogove is uffish, and Zindle is not uffish. This statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Zindle isn't a borogove.**\n   - As explained above, since Zindle is not uffish, Zindle cannot be a borogove. This statement must be true.\n\n6. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - Directly contradicts the given information that Zindle is not uffish.

Therefore, the statement simplifies to \"A rath galumphed over Bungo,\" which we don't have direct evidence for or against from the given information.

This statement cannot be definitively determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n4. **A rath galumphed over Bungo or every tove galumphed over Rafin.**\n   - Since no toves galumphed over Bungo, the second part of the disjunction (\"every tove galumphed over Rafin\") cannot be true. However, we don't have information about whether a rath galumphed over Bungo. This statement cannot be definitively determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n5. **Rafin is a tove or a rath galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - Similar to the previous analysis, we don't have information about whether Rafin is a tove or whether a rath galumphed over Bungo.

If Zindle is a tove, then Zindle will whiffle. However, if Zindle is not a tove, we cannot conclude from the given information whether Zindle will whiffle or not. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n- **Statement 2: Zindle will whiffle.**\n  - Similar to Statement 1, this depends on whether Zindle is a tove. If Zindle is a tove, then Zindle will whiffle. But if Zindle is not a tove, we cannot conclude that Zindle will whiffle. Thus, this statement also does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n- **Statement 3: Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n  - For this to be true, both Zindle and Rafin must be toves. However, we do not have enough information to determine the classification of Zindle and Rafin definitively. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n- **Statement 4: Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n  - We know that every tove will whiffle. If Bungo is a tove, then Bungo will whiffle. However, we do not have enough information to determine if Zindle is a tove. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n- **Statement 5: Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n  - According to the condition \"Every tove chortled at Bungo only if Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin,\" since every tove chortled at Bungo, it implies that Rafin did not chortle at Rafin. This statement must be true.\n\n- **Statement 6: Rafin chortled at Rafin.**\n  - This contradicts Statement 5. Since Statement 5 must be true, Statement 6 cannot be true.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement that must be true in this situation is:\n5. Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin.",

Additionally, it mentions that a borogove will whiffle, but this detail does not directly impact the snicker-snacking relationship.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't beamish and Rafin isn't beamish.**\n   - These details about Zindle and Rafin being non-beamish do not affect the snicker-snacking relationships either.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A borogove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This is directly stated in the problem: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked a rath.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **There is a borogove that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n   - The problem does not provide information about raths snicker-snacking borogoves, only that borogoves snicker-snacked raths. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true from the given information.\n\n3. **No borogoves snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This contradicts the given condition that every borogove snicker-snacked a rath. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n4. **No borogoves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - The problem states that every borogove snicker-snacked a rath, but it doesn't specify whether they snicker-snacked every single rath. Therefore, this statement could be true or false depending on additional context not provided.\n\n5. **A borogove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, while every borogove snicker-snacked at least one rath, it is not specified that a single borogove snicker-snacked all raths. So, this statement could be true or false.\n\n6. **Every borogove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Again, the problem only specifies that every borogove snicker-snacked at least one rath, not necessarily every rath.

The only information provided is that Zindle will burble, which doesn't give us enough information to conclude anything about whiffling.\n   \n2. **Zindle will whiffle**: Similar to the previous statement, there is no direct information about whether Zindle will whiffle or not.

This statement must be true.\n\n4. **Rafin will whiffle**: This contradicts the given information that Rafin won't whiffle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Rafin isn't a tove**: This also contradicts the deduction that Rafin must be a tove. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle**: Since Rafin won't whiffle, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**3.

Therefore, Rafin must be either a tove or a rath.\n   - Since Rafin chortled at Zindle, and no toves can chortle at a tove that chortled at it, if Rafin were a tove, Zindle could not be a tove. Thus, Zindle must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n4. **Not all toves will whiffle and Rafin is a tove.**\n   - Given that Rafin is a tove, and since not all toves will whiffle, it means some toves will whiffle and some will not.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - There is no direct information about whether Zindle will whiffle or not. We only know Zindle is not a tove (since Rafin is a tove and chortled at Zindle). So, this statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle won't whiffle.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, there is no direct information about Zindle's behavior regarding whiffling.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Rafin is a tove unless Bungo isn't a borogove.\n4. A rath is beamish, but it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.\n5. Zindle isn't beamish, but it is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4, we know Rafin is not a tove.\n- Since Rafin is not a tove, according to point 3, Bungo must be a borogove (because if Bungo were not a borogove, Rafin would have to be a tove, which contradicts point 4).\n- Since Rafin is not a tove, and everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n- From point 5, Rafin is beamish because it states \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish.\"\n- Since Rafin is beamish and a rath is beamish, Rafin could be a rath.\n- Zindle isn't beamish (point 5).\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true since Bungo being a borogove and not being a borogove simultaneously is impossible.\n   \n2. **Bungo isn't a borogove.**\n   - We determined that Bungo must be a borogove for Rafin to not be a tove. Therefore, this statement is false.\n   \n3. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - Point 5 directly states that Zindle isn't beamish. Thus, this statement is false.\n   \n4. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - Rafin is beamish, but Zindle isn't beamish. Therefore, this statement is false.\n   \n5. **Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This is a tautology and always true because it essentially says \"if Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove,\" which is logically equivalent to saying \"Bungo is a borogove.\"\n   \n6. **Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - As deduced from the analysis, Bungo must be a borogove for Rafin to not be a tove. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. Bungo is a borogove.**",

If tove A snicker-snacks tove B, then tove B also snicker-snacks tove A.\n\n4. **Only borogoves are beamish and every borogove is uffish.**\n   - This tells us about the properties of borogoves but doesn't directly affect the snicker-snacking behavior.\n\n5. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. It suggests that if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. However, if some toves did snicker-snack Zindle, this condition does not apply.\n\n6. **If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is a complex conditional statement involving multiple entities and actions. It doesn't directly help in determining the snicker-snacking behavior among toves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A tove snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - Given the mutual relationship among toves, if any tove snicker-snacks another tove, the other tove will also snicker-snack back. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **A tove snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - The given information does not support this. We only know that if a tove snicker-snacks another tove, the other tove will snicker-snack back, but not necessarily every tove.\n\n3. **No toves snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - This cannot be concluded from the given information. There is no evidence to suggest that no tove snicker-snacked every tove.\n\n4. **Every tove snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - Similar to statement 2, the given information does not support this. We only know about mutual snicker-snacking, not that every tove snicker-snacks another tove.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.**\n   - This aligns with the given information that every tove snicker-snacks every tove that snicker-snacked it. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Every tove snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - The given information does not support this. We only know about mutual snicker-snacking, not that every tove snicker-snacks every other tove.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- Statement 1: A tove snicker-snacked a tove.\n- Statement 5: A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.",

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - The first part \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true. The second part \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" implies that Rafin did chortle at Bungo. There is no information to confirm or deny this, so we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - The first part \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true. The second part \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is plausible but not necessarily true based on the given information.

However, we have no direct information about whether Zindle chortled at Rafin or not, so we cannot definitively conclude this statement as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Rafin is a tove or Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n   - This is a disjunction. Since we know \"No toves chortled at Rafin,\" if Rafin were a tove, he would not have chortled at himself, which aligns with the given information. Therefore, this statement can be true because either Rafin is a tove (which doesn't contradict the given information) or Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin (we don't have information to refute this).\n\n3. **No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n   - We know from the given information that \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" and \"Rafin chortled at Zindle.\" Thus, this statement is true based on the given facts.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that \"Rafin chortled at Zindle.\" Hence, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Rafin is a tove or it is not the case that Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n   - This is another disjunction. Similar to statement 2, if Rafin is a tove, it doesn't contradict the given information. The second part of the disjunction (\"it is not the case that Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin\") means Zindle did chortle at Rafin, which we don't have information to confirm or deny. Therefore, this statement can be true.\n\n6. **If Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle, then a tove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. We know \"No toves chortled at Rafin,\" so the consequent of this conditional is false. For a conditional to be false, the antecedent must be true and the consequent false. Since the consequent is false, the entire conditional is false regardless of whether Zindle chortled at Zindle or not.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 3: No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n- Statement 2: Rafin is a tove or Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.\n- Statement 5: Rafin is a tove or it is not the case that Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for which statement must be true, and considering the strictest interpretation, the most definitive statement based on the given information is:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 3 must be true.**",

Every tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked every borogove.\n5. Not all raths will whiffle, but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nLet's analyze each statement based on these premises:\n\n1. **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This cannot be concluded directly from the given information. The second premise states that every tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked every borogove, but it does not imply that no tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\n\n2. **No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This is also not supported by the given information. The second premise suggests that some toves might have snicker-snacked every borogove, which would mean they snicker-snacked at least one borogove.\n\n3. **A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information. The second premise only tells us about the relationship between toves who snicker-snacked every borogove and other toves, but it doesn't guarantee that any tove actually snicker-snacked a borogove.\n\n4. **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This is possible according to the second premise, but it is not necessarily true for all situations described. It only indicates that if a tove did snicker-snack every borogove, then every tove would snicker-snack that tove.\n\n5. **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The second premise only implies that if a tove snicker-snacked every borogove, then every tove would snicker-snack that tove, but it does not state that every tove must snicker-snack every borogove.\n\n6. **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   - This is not necessarily true either. The second premise does not provide enough information to conclude that every tove must snicker-snack at least one borogove.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the provided statements can be definitively concluded as true from the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the statements must be true in this situation.**",

The condition involving Zindle gimbled is conditional on other events, but it does not provide a definitive answer about Zindle's action.\n\n2. **Bungo galumphed over every rath.**\n   - There is no information suggesting that Bungo galumphed over any rath, let alone every rath. This statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **No raths galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - From point 4, \"A rath galumphed over Bungo only if every tove chortled at Bungo.\" Since it is stated that not all toves chortled at Bungo, it follows that no rath could have galumphed over Bungo. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Every rath galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This directly contradicts the conclusion from analyzing statement 3. Since no rath galumphed over Bungo, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **A rath galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - As analyzed for statement 3, since not all toves chortled at Bungo, no rath could have galumphed over Bungo.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and determine which of the provided statements must be true based on those conditions.\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information:\n- Everything is exclusively a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n- There is at least one of each type.\n- Rafin chortled at Rafin if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin.\n- Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n\nFrom these, we can derive:\n1. Rafin chortled at Rafin if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin.\n2. Rafin chortled at Rafin if and only if not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n\nThese two conditions imply that:\n- If Rafin chortled at Rafin, then both \"no raths chortled at Rafin\" and \"not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" must hold.\n- Conversely, if either \"some raths chortled at Rafin\" or \"all borogoves chortled at Bungo,\" then Rafin did not chortle at Rafin.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Bungo is a borogove only if every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This statement suggests that if Bungo is a borogove, then every rath must have chortled at Rafin.\n   - However, from our derived condition, if all borogoves chortled at Bungo, Rafin would not chortle at Rafin, implying some raths could have chortled at Rafin. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n2. **Bungo isn't a borogove just in case no raths chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This means if no raths chortled at Rafin, then Bungo cannot be a borogove.\n   - From our derived condition, if no raths chortled at Rafin, Rafin chortled at Rafin, which implies not all borogoves chortled at Bungo. Thus, Bungo cannot be a borogove. This statement holds.\n\n3. **No raths chortled at Rafin just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This means no raths chortled at Rafin if and only if not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n   - This directly follows from the given conditions. Hence, this statement is true.\n\n4. **If Bungo is a borogove, then every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This suggests that if Bungo is a borogove, then every rath must have chortled at Rafin.\n   - As discussed earlier, if Bungo is a borogove, it does not necessarily mean every rath chortled at Rafin. Therefore, this statement does not hold.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Bungo is a rath.**\n   - This statement combines two independent conditions without clear logical support from the given information.\n   - There is no direct evidence to support this combination. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily hold.\n\n6. **No raths chortled at Rafin if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This means no raths chortled at Rafin if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.\n   - The given conditions do not provide a direct link between raths chortling at Rafin and borogoves chortling at Bungo. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily hold.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 2: Bungo isn't a borogove just in case no raths chortled at Rafin.\n- Statement 3: No raths chortled at Rafin just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 2 and 3 must be true.",

Since we know from the information that no borogoves will whiffle, the first part of this statement cannot be true. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Every borogove will whiffle.**\n   - We know that no borogoves will whiffle, so this statement is false.\n\n3. **A borogove will whiffle.**\n   - Given that no borogoves will whiffle, this statement is also false.\n\n4. **Not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - Since no borogoves will whiffle, it is true that not all borogoves will whiffle. This statement is true.\n\n5. **Only borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This statement is false because no borogoves will whiffle, meaning no entities will whiffle.\n\n6. **Only borogoves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - The first part of this statement (\"only borogoves will whiffle\") is false, and the second part (\"not all borogoves will whiffle\") is true.

Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **No toves snicker-snacked Zindle if and only if every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This translates to: \\( \\neg T \\leftrightarrow \\text{every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo} \\).\n   - There is no direct information linking \\( \\neg T \\) to the behavior of all borogoves towards Bungo. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true from the given information.\n\n3. **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.**\n   - We have \\( \\neg G \\rightarrow M \\), but there is no information about whether Zindle galumphed over Bungo (\\( G \\)) or not.

Rafin could be a borogove or a rath, but we cannot definitively say he isn't a tove.\n\n2. **Rafin chortled at a tove.**\n   - We have no information about whether Rafin chortled at anyone, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n3. **Every tove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that no toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n4. **Not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n   - Since no toves chortled at Rafin, it is true that not all toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n5. **A tove chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given information that no toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n6. **Rafin chortled at every tove.**\n   - We have no information about whether Rafin chortled at anyone, so this cannot be concluded.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. Not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n\nThis is the only statement that aligns with the given information without making unsupported assumptions.",

This means Zindle could be a tove or a rath.\n- Point 6 indicates that a rath galumphed over Zindle, which doesn't directly tell us what Zindle is but suggests Zindle could be a tove or a borogove.\n- Since Rafin is not a tove, and only toves are beamish, Rafin cannot be beamish.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n   - False, because Rafin is not a tove and thus cannot be beamish.\n   \n2. **Rafin isn't beamish.**\n   - True, because Rafin is not a tove and only toves are beamish.\n   \n3. **Zindle is beamish.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Zindle is a tove or not, so we can't conclude this.\n   \n4. **Rafin is beamish.**\n   - False, because Rafin is not a tove and thus cannot be beamish.\n   \n5. **Zindle and Bungo are beamish.**\n   - We don't have enough information about Bungo being a tove or not, so we can't conclude this.\n   \n6. **Zindle isn't beamish.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Zindle is a tove or not, so we can't conclude this.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Rafin is a borogove.\n3. Only borogoves are beamish.\n4. It is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n5. Every tove is uffish unless every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n6. If Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves are beamish.\n7. A borogove will burble.\n8. Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Rafin is a borogove** and only borogoves are beamish, so Rafin is beamish.\n- Since \"a borogove will burble,\" Rafin will burble.\n- The statement \"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo\" doesn't provide direct information about Bungo's type or behavior beyond this specific action.\n- The condition \"Every tove is uffish unless every borogove chortled at Bungo\" suggests that if any borogove did not chortle at Bungo, then every tove is uffish. However, we don't have enough information to determine whether every borogove chortled at Bungo or not.\n- The statement \"If Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves are beamish\" is conditional and does not give us direct information about the beamishness of toves without knowing if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Only borogoves are beamish and no borogoves will burble.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that \"a borogove will burble.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Rafin won't burble.**\n   - This directly contradicts the fact that \"a borogove will burble\" and Rafin is a borogove. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Rafin will burble.**\n   - Since Rafin is a borogove and \"a borogove will burble,\" this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Only borogoves are beamish and a borogove will burble.**\n   - This aligns with the given information. Both parts of the statement are true based on the provided facts.\n\n5. **Bungo will burble.**\n   - We do not have sufficient information to determine if Bungo will burble. Bungo could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and the information about burbling applies specifically to borogoves. Without knowing Bungo's type, we cannot conclude this statement is necessarily true.\n\n6. **Rafin and Bungo will burble.**\n   - While Rafin will burble as a borogove, we lack information to confirm Bungo will burble. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3.

The given condition does not provide enough information to confirm this universally; it only states what happens when a rath is snicker-snacked by another rath.\n\n2. **A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This implies that there is at least one rath that snicker-snacked all other raths.

The given condition does not support this as it only specifies mutual snicker-snacking between raths that have already snicker-snacked each other.\n\n5. **No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - This contradicts the possibility that a rath could snicker-snack every other rath.

Therefore, this statement cannot be true because it contradicts the given information.\n\n6. **Not all borogoves will burble.**\n   - Given that \"no borogoves will burble,\" it logically follows that not all borogoves will burble.

This does not necessarily mean Zindle isn't a tove; it could still be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle isn't a tove based on the given information alone.\n\n2. **Zindle is a tove.**\n   - Similar to the previous analysis, the information provided does not definitively establish that Zindle is a tove. It only tells us about the actions involving Zindle but does not specify its type.\n\n3. **Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - Since every rath galumphed over Rafin, and there are no restrictions on what Rafin can be, Rafin could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. However, if Rafin were a tove, then the statement \"every rath galumphed over Rafin\" would imply that raths galumphed over a tove, which is possible. Thus, we cannot conclude that Rafin isn't a tove.\n\n4. **Bungo is a tove.**\n   - Bungo chortled at Bungo, and no toves chortled at Bungo. If Bungo were a tove, this would create a contradiction because a tove cannot chortle at Bungo. Therefore, Bungo cannot be a tove.\n\n5. **Rafin is a tove.**\n   - As discussed earlier, Rafin could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. The information does not provide enough evidence to conclude that Rafin specifically is a tove.\n\n6. **Bungo isn't a tove.**\n   - Given that no toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo chortled at Bungo, Bungo cannot be a tove. This statement must be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 6. Bungo isn't a tove.**",

It only states that Bungo chortled at Zindle, but it doesn't specify what Zindle is. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Bungo chortled at every tove.**\n   - There is no information indicating that Bungo chortled at every tove. We only know that Bungo chortled at Zindle, which could be anything. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **No toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is supported by the fact that Rafin, who is a tove, did not chortle at Bungo. However, we don't have information about other toves, so we can't definitively say this for all toves. But since Rafin is a tove and didn't chortle at Bungo, and there's no information suggesting otherwise, this statement seems likely to be true.\n\n4. **A tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Since we know Rafin, a tove, did not chortle at Bungo, and there's no information about other toves chortling at Bungo, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - Given that Rafin, a tove, did not chortle at Bungo, this statement must be true. At least one tove (Rafin) did not chortle at Bungo.\n\n6. **Every tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is directly contradicted by the fact that Rafin, a tove, did not chortle at Bungo. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**5. Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**",

This does not provide enough information to conclude whether all toves did or did not galumph over Bungo. Therefore, we cannot definitively say this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Bungo galumphed over every tove.**\n   - The information given does not indicate anything about Bungo's actions towards other toves. It only states that Rafin (a tove) galumphed over Bungo. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Every tove galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - Similar to the previous analysis, we only have information about Rafin, a specific tove, galumphing over Bungo. This does not imply that every tove did so. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **No toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - Since Rafin, who is a tove, galumphed over Bungo, this statement directly contradicts the given information. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5. **A tove galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - Given that Rafin, who is a tove, galumphed over Bungo, this statement is true based on the provided information.\n\n6. **Bungo galumphed over a tove.**\n   - The information given does not provide any details about Bungo's actions towards toves. It only tells us that Rafin (a tove) galumphed over Bungo. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**5. A tove galumphed over Bungo.**",

Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Bungo chortled at Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - Both parts of this statement are directly supported by the given information. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **A rath galumphed over Bungo only if a rath chortled at Zindle.**\n   - Similar to the first statement, we lack information about whether a rath galumphed over Bungo or chortled at Zindle. Hence, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n4. **Bungo chortled at Bungo and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - The second part is true (a rath galumphed over Zindle), but we have no information about Bungo chortling at Bungo. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n5. **If Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - This is a complex conditional statement. We do not have information about Zindle galumphing over Bungo or raths chortling or galumphing over Bungo. Thus, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n6. **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - The second part is true (a rath galumphed over Zindle), but we have no information about Bungo chortling at Bungo. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n2.

If Zindle were a rath, then Zindle would have gimbled because every rath gimbled. However, if Zindle is not a rath, we cannot conclude anything about whether Zindle gimbled or not based on the given information. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively determined as true.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin gimbled.**\n   - We know that every rath gimbled, but we do not have enough information to determine if Zindle and Rafin are raths. Thus, we cannot conclude that both Zindle and Rafin gimbled.\n\n3. **Zindle and Bungo gimbled.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, we do not have sufficient information to determine if Zindle is a rath. Additionally, there is no information indicating that Bungo is a rath. Hence, we cannot conclude that both Zindle and Bungo gimbled.\n\n4. **Every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This statement combines two pieces of information: \"every rath gimbled\" and \"Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" Both parts are explicitly stated in the given information. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Every rath gimbled but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given information that \"Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Zindle gimbled.**\n   - As previously discussed, we do not have enough information to determine if Zindle is a rath. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle gimbled.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. Every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 4 must be true.",

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every borogove is mimsy just in case no toves will burble.\n4. A borogove will burble but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.\n5. Every rath gyred.\n6. Not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Statement 3**: \"Every borogove is mimsy just in case no toves will burble.\"\n  - This means if no toves will burble, then every borogove is mimsy. Conversely, if some toves will burble, then not every borogove is mimsy.\n  \n- **Statement 4**: \"A borogove will burble but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.\"\n  - This implies that a borogove will burble and Zindle is mimsy.\n  \n- **Statement 5**: \"Every rath gyred.\"\n  - This directly states that all raths have gyrated.\n  \n- **Statement 6**: \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\"\n  - This indicates that there is at least one tove that did not galumph over Zindle.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Zindle gyred.**\n   - The information does not specify whether Zindle is a rath, tove, or borogove. Since only raths are stated to have gyrated, we cannot conclude that Zindle gyred unless Zindle is a rath. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - There is no direct information about Zindle burbling. We know a borogove will burble, but we do not know if Zindle is a borogove. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, there is no direct information about Zindle burbling. We cannot definitively say Zindle won't burble without knowing its type. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every rath gyred and no borogoves will burble.**\n   - We know every rath has gyrated. However, we also know that a borogove will burble. Therefore, this statement is false because it contradicts the given information.\n\n5. **A borogove will burble and every rath gyred.**\n   - We know from the information that a borogove will burble and every rath has gyrated. This statement aligns with the given facts and is therefore true.\n\n6. **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n   - As mentioned earlier, we do not have enough information to determine if Zindle is a rath, tove, or borogove. Without knowing Zindle's type, we cannot conclude that Zindle didn't gyre. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**5. A borogove will burble and every rath gyred.**\n\nThis statement is consistent with the provided conditions and can be logically deduced from the given information.",

Given that every borogove chortled at Zindle (a rath), this statement could be true, but we cannot conclude it must be true without more specific information about all raths.\n\n2. **A borogove chortled at every rath that chortled at it.**\n   - This is directly stated in the problem: \"Every borogove chortled at every rath that chortled at it.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Every borogove chortled at every rath.**\n   - The problem states that every borogove chortled at Zindle (a rath), but it does not specify that every borogove chortled at every single rath. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A borogove chortled at a rath.**\n   - Since every borogove chortled at Zindle (a rath), this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Every borogove chortled at a rath.**\n   - Again, since every borogove chortled at Zindle (a rath), this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No borogoves chortled at every rath.**\n   - This contradicts the fact that every borogove chortled at Zindle (a rath). Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 2: A borogove chortled at every rath that chortled at it.\n- Statement 4: A borogove chortled at a rath.\n- Statement 5: Every borogove chortled at a rath.\n\nFinal Answer: Statements 2, 4, and 5 must be true.",

Everything is a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each type.\n3. Rafin didn't chortle at Zindle.\n4. Every rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked it.\n5. A borogove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over a rath.\n6. Every tove chortled at Bungo only if not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No toves snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This statement suggests that no interaction of snicker-snacking occurred between toves and raths.\n- However, we know from condition 4 that every rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked it. This implies that some toves must have snicker-snacked raths for the raths to respond in kind.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This statement suggests that at least one tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n- From condition 4, since every rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked it, it logically follows that at least one tove must have snicker-snacked a rath.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n- This statement suggests that each tove snicker-snacked every single rath.\n- The given conditions do not provide enough information to conclude that every tove snicker-snacked every rath. It only states that raths snicker-snack toves that snicker-snack them, which does not imply universality across all toves and raths.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No toves snicker-snacked every rath.\n- This statement suggests that no tove snicker-snacked all raths.\n- Since we don't have information indicating that any tove snicker-snacked all raths, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given conditions alone.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be conclusively determined as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This statement suggests that each tove snicker-snacked at least one rath.\n- The given conditions do not provide enough information to conclude that every tove snicker-snacked a rath. We only know that some interactions occurred, but not necessarily involving every tove.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n- This statement suggests that at least one tove snicker-snacked all raths.\n- Similar to Statement 3, the given conditions do not provide enough information to conclude that any single tove snicker-snacked all raths.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**Statement 2: A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**",

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Every tove is uffish.**\n   - If every tove were uffish, then according to the condition \"Every rath will whiffle unless every tove is uffish,\" no raths would whiffle. However, the condition states \"Not all raths will whiffle,\" which means some raths do whiffle. Thus, not every tove can be uffish. This statement is false.\n\n3. **No toves are uffish.**\n   - If no toves were uffish, then according to the condition \"Zindle isn't a borogove unless no toves are uffish,\" Zindle would not be a borogove. However, this does not provide enough information to conclude that no toves are uffish definitively. We need more context to confirm this.\n\n4. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - The condition about Zindle being a borogove or not depends on whether toves are uffish. Without knowing the exact status of toves being uffish or not, we cannot determine if Zindle will whiffle. This statement cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n5. **Not all toves are uffish.**\n   - Given the condition \"Every rath will whiffle unless every tove is uffish\" and the fact that \"Not all raths will whiffle,\" it implies that not all toves can be uffish. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Only toves are uffish.**\n   - This statement suggests that no other types (borogoves or raths) are uffish. However, the given conditions do not provide enough information to confirm this. It is possible for other types to be uffish as well.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5. Not all toves are uffish.**",

No toves galumphed over Zindle unless not all toves will burble.\n5. If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if every rath is beamish.\n6.

Rafin is a tove.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A tove galumphed over a rath.\n- From point 3, we know there is a rath that every tove galumphed over. This implies that at least one tove (actually every tove) galumphed over a rath.\n- Therefore, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a tove that every rath galumphed over.\n- The given information does not provide any direct evidence about whether every rath galumphed over a specific tove. It only states that every tove galumphed over a specific rath.\n- Therefore, **Statement 2 cannot be concluded as true based on the given information**.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every tove galumphed over every rath.\n- Point 3 only states that there is a rath that every tove galumphed over, not that every tove galumphed over every rath.\n- Therefore, **Statement 3 is false**.\n\n#### Statement 4: No toves galumphed over every rath.\n- Since we know from point 3 that every tove galumphed over a specific rath, it contradicts this statement.\n- Therefore, **Statement 4 is false**.\n\n#### Statement 5: No toves galumphed over a rath.\n- This directly contradicts point 3, which states that every tove galumphed over a specific rath.\n- Therefore, **Statement 5 is false**.\n\n#### Statement 6: A tove galumphed over every rath.\n- The given information does not provide enough details to conclude that a single tove galumphed over every rath.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. A borogove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.\n4. No raths snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked it.\n5. Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n6. Rafin is a tove.\n7. If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Rafin is beamish only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\n8. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n9. Zindle isn't beamish.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know from condition 8 that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, but we don't have enough information about whether Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - Again, we know not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, but we don't have information about whether Zindle snicker-snacked itself. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This implies Bungo did snicker-snack Zindle, but we don't have enough information to confirm this. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know from condition 5 that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo, and from condition 8 that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. This statement aligns with both pieces of information, so it must be true.\n\n5. **Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We don't have information about whether Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle or whether no toves chortled at Bungo. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This implies Zindle did snicker-snack itself, but we don't have enough information to confirm this. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 4. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every tove chortled at Bungo.\n3. Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n4. Only borogoves gyred.\n5. Not all toves chortled at Rafin only if not all toves are beamish.\n6. If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin is beamish.\n7. Zindle isn't beamish.\n8. It is not the case that Rafin gyred.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4, we know that only borogoves gyred. Therefore, if something gyred, it must be a borogove.\n- From point 8, since Rafin did not gyre, Rafin cannot be a borogove.\n- Since everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and Rafin is not a borogove, Rafin must be either a tove or a rath.\n- From point 7, Zindle isn't beamish. This doesn't directly tell us what Zindle is, but it does give us information about its property.\n- From point 3, Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo, which means Bungo can't be a tove because every tove chortled at Bungo (point 2). Thus, Bungo must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n   - Zindle isn't beamish, but this doesn't tell us if Zindle is a borogove. We don't have enough information to conclude Zindle gyred.\n   - Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo, so Bungo is not a tove. However, we don't know if Bungo is a borogove or a rath. If Bungo were a borogove, it could have gyrated, but we can't confirm this.\n   - Conclusion: Cannot be determined as true.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n   - Zindle isn't beamish, but this doesn't tell us if Zindle is a borogove.\n   - Rafin did not gyre (point 8).\n   - Conclusion: False.\n\n3. **Bungo isn't a tove.**\n   - Correct, as established from point 3 and point 2.\n   - Conclusion: True.\n\n4. **Bungo is a tove.**\n   - Incorrect, as established from point 3 and point 2.\n   - Conclusion: False.\n\n5. **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n   - Zindle isn't beamish, but this doesn't tell us if Zindle is a borogove. We don't have enough information to conclude Zindle didn't gyre.\n   - Conclusion: Cannot be determined as true.\n\n6. **Zindle gyred.**\n   - Zindle isn't beamish, but this doesn't tell us if Zindle is a borogove. We don't have enough information to conclude Zindle gyred.\n   - Conclusion: Cannot be determined as true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3.

However, since we know every tove snicker-snacked every rath, it doesn't contradict this statement, but it also doesn't confirm it. We can't definitively say this is true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Every rath snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - The problem does not state that every rath snicker-snacked every tove; it only mentions that a rath snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked a tove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No toves snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given information that every tove snicker-snacked every rath. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**2. Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 2 must be true.",

However, we have no direct information about whether Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin or not, nor do we know if any toves snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true based on the given information.\n\n2. **No toves snicker-snacked Zindle only if Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - This statement is the contrapositive of the first statement. It suggests that if Rafin did snicker-snack Rafin, then some toves must have snicker-snacked Zindle. Again, we lack sufficient information to confirm this.\n\n3. **Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - We know Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle, which is true. However, we also know that Rafin is not a tove, so \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove\" is false. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - Both parts of this conjunction are true: Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle, and Rafin isn't a tove. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.**\n   - The second part of this conjunction is true because Rafin is not a tove.

Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin is a tove.**\n   - The second part of this conjunction is false because Rafin is not a tove.

Therefore, Zindle cannot be a tove. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - Given that a rath chortled at Zindle only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, and we know that a rath did indeed chortle at Zindle, it follows that Rafin must have snicker-snacked Rafin. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n3. **Rafin is a tove.**\n   - We don't have direct information about Rafin's category from the given conditions. However, since Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin (as deduced above), and there's no restriction on toves regarding snicker-snacking themselves, this statement could be true but isn't necessarily required by the conditions.\n\n4. **Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n   - As deduced from the analysis of statement 2, this must be true because a rath chortled at Zindle, which requires Rafin to have snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n5. **Zindle is a tove.**\n   - Contradicts the analysis for statement 1. This statement must be false.\n\n6. **Rafin isn't a tove.**\n   - Similar to statement 3, we don't have direct information about Rafin's category. While Rafin could be a tove, this statement isn't necessarily true based on the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- Zindle isn't a tove (Statement 1).\n- Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin (Statement 4).",

Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Zindle gyred. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Rafin gyred.**\n   - The information does not specify whether Rafin gyrated or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred.**\n   - We know a borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred. Both parts of this statement are true based on the given information. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Zindle gyred.**\n   - While a borogove chortled at Rafin, Zindle did gyre. This makes the second part of the statement false. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n   - We know Zindle gyred, but we do not have information confirming that Rafin gyrated. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A rath chortled at every borogove.\n3. Bungo snicker-snacked every tove.\n4. Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.\n5. Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case a borogove chortled at Bungo.\n6. A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove**: This statement is contradictory because it implies that Bungo cannot be a borogove under any circumstances. Therefore, Bungo must be either a tove or a rath.\n- **A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo**: This means Bungo did snicker-snack Bungo. Since Bungo snicker-snacks every tove, if Bungo were a tove, Bungo would have snicker-snacked itself. However, if Bungo were a rath, it wouldn't necessarily follow from the given information that Bungo snicker-snacks itself. Thus, Bungo must be a tove.\n- **Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case a borogove chortled at Bungo**: This statement doesn't provide direct information about Bungo but suggests a conditional relationship between Zindle and borogoves.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **A rath chortled at Bungo**:\n   - Since Bungo is a tove, and raths chortle at borogoves, we don't have information indicating raths chortle at toves. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No raths chortled at Bungo**:\n   - Similar to the previous point, since Bungo is a tove, and raths chortle at borogoves, no raths chortling at Bungo is consistent with the given information. This statement could be true.\n\n3. **Bungo chortled at every rath**:\n   - There is no information suggesting Bungo chortles at anything. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Bungo chortled at a rath**:\n   - Again, there is no information suggesting Bungo chortles at anything. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Not all raths chortled at Bungo**:\n   - Since Bungo is a tove, and raths chortle at borogoves, this statement is consistent with the given information. It could be true.\n\n6. **Every rath chortled at Bungo**:\n   - Since Bungo is a tove, and raths chortle at borogoves, this statement contradicts the given information. It is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- **No raths chortled at Bungo** (Statement 2)\n- **Not all raths chortled at Bungo** (Statement 5)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n- Statements 2 and 5 must be true.",

Thus, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - Given that every borogove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it, it logically follows that at least one tove galumphed over a borogove.

However, if other entities (borogoves or raths) gyred, Zindle did not chortle at Rafin.\n\n4. **If every rath galumphed over Rafin, then every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This indicates a conditional relationship: if all raths galumphed over Rafin, then all raths also chortled at Rafin.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This tells us that at least one borogove chortled at Rafin, and not all toves performed the action of snicker-snacking Zindle.\n\n6. **Every rath gyred and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - This means all raths performed the action of gyring, and at least one rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - True. According to the second condition, every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it, which implies that there is at least one instance of a tove galumphing over a borogove.\n\n2. **No toves galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - False. Contradicts the second condition.\n\n3. **A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - Not necessarily true. The second condition does not specify that every tove galumphed over every borogove, only that each tove galumphed over some borogove.\n\n4. **There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.**\n   - Not necessarily true. The second condition specifies a mutual relationship but does not imply that every borogove galumphed over the same tove.\n\n5. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - Not necessarily true. The second condition does not specify that every tove galumphed over every borogove, only that each tove galumphed over some borogove.\n\n6. **No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - Not necessarily true. While the second condition does not specify that every tove galumphed over every borogove, it does not rule out the possibility either.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement that must be true is:\n1. A tove galumphed over a borogove.",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A rath chortled at Bungo.\n3. A borogove is uffish and only borogoves gyred.\n4.

Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo and Rafin isn't uffish.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Raths**: At least one exists, and they chortle at others.\n- **Borogoves**: At least one exists, are uffish, and only they gyre.\n- **Toves**: At least one exists, and their uffishness depends on whether Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n- **Chortling**: A rath chortled at Bungo, Rafin chortled at Zindle, and every rath chortled at Zindle.\n- **Uffishness**: Borogoves are uffish, Rafin isn't uffish, and toves are uffish unless Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle.\n- **Gyres**: Only borogoves gyre.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **No raths chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that \"every rath chortled at Zindle.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **A rath chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This aligns with the given information that \"every rath chortled at Zindle.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Zindle chortled at a rath.**\n   - There is no information indicating that Zindle chortled at anyone, so we cannot conclude this statement as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Not all raths chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that \"every rath chortled at Zindle.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Zindle gyred.**\n   - Gyres are performed exclusively by borogoves. Since there is no indication that Zindle is a borogove, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Zindle chortled at every rath.**\n   - There is no information indicating that Zindle chortled at anyone, so we cannot conclude this statement as true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2.
