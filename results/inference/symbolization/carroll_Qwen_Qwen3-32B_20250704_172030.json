            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, the abbreviations are O for \"[1] is a rath\", P for \"[1] chortled at [2]\", and c is Bungo. So the sentence is saying that it's not true that every rath chortled at Bungo.\n\nIn predicate logic, \"all raths chortled at Bungo\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Because for every x, if x is a rath (Ox), then x chortled at c (Bungo). \n\nBut the original sentence is \"Not all...\", which is the negation of that universal statement. So the negation of \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) would be \u2203x \u00ac(Ox \u2192 Pxc). Wait, but how does that work? The negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential quantifier with the negated inner part. So \u00ac\u2200x (A) is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acA. \n\nSo applying that here, \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo\" becomes \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc), which is equivalent to \u2203x \u00ac(Ox \u2192 Pxc). But maybe it's more straightforward to write it as the negation of the universal statement. However, sometimes people prefer to push the negation inside. Let me recall: \u00ac(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to A \u2227 \u00acB. Because A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B, so the negation would be A \u2227 \u00acB. \n\nSo if I have \u2203x \u00ac(Ox \u2192 Pxc), that's equivalent to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc). Because the negation of the implication is the antecedent being true and the consequent false. So there exists some x that is a rath and did not chortle at Bungo. \n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. So which form is acceptable? The original sentence is a negation of a universal, so both forms are correct. However, the example given in the problem uses the universal form. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the original sentence is \"Not all...\", then the correct formalization would be the negation of that universal. \n\nSo the direct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). But sometimes in predicate logic, it's preferable to avoid starting with a negation, so converting it to \u2203x... might be better. However, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both forms are valid. But maybe the expected answer is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc). Let me think again. \n\nThe original statement is \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" Another way to phrase this is \"There exists at least one rath who did not chortle at Bungo.\" Which would directly translate to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc). \n\nBut the negation of the universal is equivalent. So both forms are logically equivalent. However, depending on the required form. The example uses the universal quantifier with implication. So perhaps the problem expects the negation of that structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in the form that starts with the existential. Let me check the example again. The example for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). If the sentence were \"Not every linguist admires Charlie,\" that would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). But which form is expected here? The problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are correct, but perhaps the answer expects the existential form. \n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations don't specify any particular structure, so both forms are acceptable. However, in the example, they used the universal. So maybe the answer here is \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). But maybe the problem expects the equivalent existential. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" The standard way to formalize \"Not all A are B\" is \u2203x (A(x) \u2227 \u00acB(x)). So in this case, \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc). Therefore, that's likely the expected answer. \n\nBut let me confirm. Let's take an example. If the sentence is \"Not all dogs are mammals,\" which is a false statement, but the formalization would be \u2203x (Dog(x) \u2227 \u00acMammal(x)). So in this case, the correct formalization is the existential. Therefore, for the given problem, the answer should be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc). \n\nBut then again, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The original sentence is a negation of a universal statement. So maybe both forms are acceptable. However, the example uses the universal form. But the example is a universal affirmative, whereas here we have a negation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the negation of the universal. For example, if the example was \"Not every linguist admires Charlie,\" the formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). But in that case, the answer could be written as such. However, in the example given, the correct formalization for the original sentence is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the problem wants the direct negation, then \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxc). But maybe the problem expects the equivalent existential. \n\nBut since the problem says to return a well-formed formula, both are correct. However, in standard practice, when translating \"Not all...\", the existential is preferred. Therefore, I think the answer is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc). \n\nLet me check again. The original sentence: Not all raths chortled at Bungo. So \"all raths chortled at Bungo\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). The negation is \u2203x \u00ac(Ox \u2192 Pxc). But as mentioned, \u00ac(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to A \u2227 \u00acB. So \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc). So that's the correct translation. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc).\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo and only borogoves gyred.\" And I need to translate it into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence into parts. The first part is \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\" The abbreviations given are P for \"[1] chortled at [2]\", with b being Rafin and c being Bungo. So, the first part should be the negation of P applied to b and c. That would be \u00acPbc. Got that.\n\nNow the second part: \"only borogoves gyred.\" The key here is \"only\" which usually translates to a universal quantifier. The structure here is that if something gyred, then it must be a borogove. The abbreviations are N for \"[1] is a borogove\" and H for \"[1] gyred\". So, for all x, if Hx (x gyred), then Nx (x is a borogove). So that would be \u2200x(Hx \u2192 Nx). \n\nPutting the two parts together with a conjunction. The original sentence uses \"and\", so we need to combine the two statements with \u2227. So the entire formula should be \u00acPbc \u2227 \u2200x(Hx \u2192 Nx). \n\nWait, let me check if I got the order right. The first part is about Rafin not chortling at Bungo, which is straightforward. For the second part, \"only borogoves gyred\" means that being a borogove is a necessary condition for gyred. So indeed, if something gyred, it must be a borogove. So the implication is Hx \u2192 Nx. That's correct. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any quantifiers elsewhere. The first part is a specific statement about two individuals, so no quantifier needed there. The second part is a universal statement. So combining them with \u2227 is correct. \n\nSo the final formula should be \u00acPbc \u2227 \u2200x(Hx \u2192 Nx). Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they use arrow for implication, and the universal quantifier. So my structure here is similar for the second part. \n\nYes, I think that's right. No other abbreviations are needed here. The sentence has two separate clauses connected by \"and\", so they are separate formulas connected by \u2227. \n\nI don't see any other elements in the sentence. \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is straightforward negation. \"Only borogoves gyred\" is the universal statement. So the translation should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00acPbc \u2227 \u2200x(Hx\u2192Nx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate \"No borogoves galumphed over Bungo\" into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. The abbreviations are N for \"[1] is a borogove\", Q for \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", and c is \"Bungo\".\n\nFirst, the sentence says that there are no borogoves that galumphed over Bungo. So, in other words, for all things, if they are a borogove, then they did not galumph over Bungo. Or maybe it's saying that there doesn't exist a borogove that galumphed over Bungo.\n\nLet me think. The original sentence is a universal negative. In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" is usually translated as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx). But here, it's \"No A do C over c\". So maybe it's \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)). Because for every x, if x is a borogove (Nx), then it is not the case that x galumphed over Bungo (\u00acQxc).\n\nAlternatively, another way to express \"No A are B\" is \u00ac\u2203x(Ax \u2227 Bx). So here, it would be \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Q(x, c)). Both formulations are equivalent because the universal statement and the negated existential are logically equivalent.\n\nWhich one should I use? The example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So following that pattern, maybe the answer here should use a universal quantifier. So \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)).\n\nBut let me double-check. The sentence is \"No borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\" So \"No N Q over c\". So for all x, if x is a borogove, then x did not Q over c. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe using the negation of an existential. But since the example uses universal for \"every\", maybe here for \"no\", which is a universal negative, using the universal quantifier with implication and negation is appropriate.\n\nSo the correct formalization would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxc). Alternatively, \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Qxc). But which is preferred here? The example uses the universal approach. Let me check: \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So \"No linguist admires Charlie\" would be \u2200x(Lx\u2192\u00acRxc), right? Which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x(Lx \u2227 Rxc). So both are correct, but depending on the structure of the original sentence.\n\nIn the given problem, the original sentence is \"No borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\" So it's stating that there are none of a certain kind doing something. The structure is similar to \"No A do B\", which can be expressed as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx). So in this case, \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxc). Since the example uses the universal quantifier, I think that's the way to go here. So the answer should be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxc).\n\nWait, but Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2]\". So Q takes two arguments. The first is the subject, the second is the object. So Q(x, c) would be \"x galumphed over c\". So the correct formula is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)). In the example, R is \"[1] admires [2]\", so Rxc is \"x admires c\". Similarly here, Qxc is \"x galumphed over c\". So yes, the formula would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxc). Alternatively written with parentheses as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQ(x,c)).\n\nSo the final answer should be \u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acQxc). Using the abbreviations given. Let me check again: N is [1] is a borogove. So Nx is \"x is a borogove\". Q is [1] galumphed over [2], so Qxc is \"x galumphed over c (Bungo)\". So the translation of \"No borogoves galumphed over Bungo\" is \"For all x, if x is a borogove, then it is not the case that x galumphed over Bungo.\" Which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxc). That seems correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acQxc)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless Zindle isn't a borogove.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"[1] is a rath\", Q for \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", c for Bungo, N for \"[1] is a borogove\", and a for Zindle.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main structure here is \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless Zindle isn't a borogove.\" The word \"unless\" usually translates to a logical disjunction or implication. In logic, \"P unless Q\" can be translated as \"P \u2228 Q\" or \"\u00acQ \u2192 P\". But I need to be careful here. Let me think: if the sentence is \"P unless Q\", then it's equivalent to \"if not Q, then P\", which would be \u00acQ \u2192 P. Alternatively, it could also be P \u2228 Q. However, in formal logic, these are equivalent because material implication (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2228 B). So, depending on how the sentence is structured, I can choose either form.\n\nThe sentence here is \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless Zindle isn't a borogove.\" Let's break it down. Let me assign parts. Let me denote:\n\nP: A rath galumphed over Bungo.\n\nQ: Zindle isn't a borogove. Which is \u00acN(a), since N is \"[1] is a borogove\" and a is Zindle. So Q would be \u00acN(a).\n\nSo the sentence is P unless Q. So, according to the \"unless\" structure, this would be P \u2228 Q. Alternatively, \u00acQ \u2192 P.\n\nBut let's think about the meaning. If Zindle is a borogove (i.e., if \u00acQ is true, since Q is \"Zindle isn't a borogove\"), then P must hold. So if N(a) is true (Zindle is a borogove), then P must be true. So that would be N(a) \u2192 P. Alternatively, since Q is \u00acN(a), then \u00acQ is N(a), so \u00acQ \u2192 P is equivalent to N(a) \u2192 P.\n\nBut the original sentence says \"unless Zindle isn't a borogove\", which is Q. So \"P unless Q\" is equivalent to \"if not Q then P\". So that would be \u00acQ \u2192 P. Which is N(a) \u2192 P.\n\nNow, what is P? \"A rath galumphed over Bungo.\" So there exists some rath (since \"a rath\") that galumphed over Bungo. So P can be translated as \u2203x (O(x) \u2227 Q(x, c)). Because O is \"[1] is a rath\", and Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", and c is Bungo.\n\nPutting it all together: The entire sentence is \u00acQ \u2192 P, where Q here is \u00acN(a) and P is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)). Wait, no. Let me correct that. The original Q is the part after \"unless\". Let me re-express:\n\nOriginal sentence: P unless Q, where P is \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\" and Q is \"Zindle isn't a borogove\".\n\nSo translating \"P unless Q\" as \"\u00acQ \u2192 P\". Therefore, the formula would be:\n\n\u00ac(Zindle isn't a borogove) \u2192 (A rath galumphed over Bungo)\n\nWhich is N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)).\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)).\n\nAlternatively, if I use the other approach of P \u2228 Q, that would be [\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c))] \u2228 [\u00acN(a)]. But both forms are logically equivalent. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Let me check if that's acceptable.\n\nThe abbreviations are O, Q, c, N, a. So yes, the translation uses those. Now, the question is whether the correct translation uses implication or disjunction. Since \"unless\" is often translated as implication, but both are equivalent, but perhaps the expected answer is one or the other. Let me think again. In the example given, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the example uses implication for a universal quantifier. But here, the structure is different. Let me see.\n\nIn the example, the sentence is a universal statement. Here, the main connective is the \"unless\", which is a binary connective. The example uses implication for the universal quantifier. But here, the main connective is either implication or disjunction. Let me check the exact meaning. The sentence says that if Zindle is a borogove (i.e., if \u00acQ is true), then a rath galumphed over Bungo. So the implication is the right way. Alternatively, if Zindle isn't a borogove, then maybe the galumphing didn't happen? No, the \"unless\" structure says that the galumphing happens unless Zindle isn't a borogove. Wait, the original sentence is \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless Zindle isn't a borogove.\" So, if Zindle isn't a borogove (Q), then maybe the galumphing didn't happen? Or is it that the galumphing happens unless Q is true. Let me think again. The phrase \"P unless Q\" is equivalent to \"if not Q then P\" and also \"P or Q\". So in this case, if Zindle is a borogove (i.e., \u00acQ is true, since Q is \"Zindle isn't a borogove\"), then P (a rath galumphed over Bungo) must be true. So the correct translation is N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)). Alternatively, \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)) \u2228 \u00acN(a). But since the problem says to use the standard logical symbols, both are correct. However, perhaps the expected answer is the implication form. Let me check the example again. The example uses implication in the universal quantifier. But here, since the main connective is \"unless\", which is a binary connective, the answer could be either. However, perhaps the more natural translation is the implication. Let me go with that.\n\nTherefore, the formalization is N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)).\n\nWait, but the sentence is \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless Zindle isn't a borogove.\" So the \"unless\" is between the two parts. Let me re-express the sentence as \"P unless Q\", which is equivalent to \"If not Q, then P\". Here, Q is \"Zindle isn't a borogove\", so not Q is \"Zindle is a borogove\", which is N(a). Therefore, the implication is N(a) \u2192 P. And P is \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\", which is an existential statement. So the entire formula is N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final formula is N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)).\n\nAlternatively, if the user expects the disjunction form, it would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)) \u2228 \u00acN(a). But since the example uses implication for the universal statement, maybe the implication is preferred here. However, the example is a universal, while here the main connective is different. Let me check the equivalence. The two forms are equivalent because P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So in this case, N(a) \u2192 \u2203x... is equivalent to \u00acN(a) \u2228 \u2203x... So both are acceptable. Which one is preferred? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are standard. However, perhaps the \"unless\" is more naturally translated as a disjunction. Let me think again. The sentence says \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless Zindle isn't a borogove.\" So, the galumphing happened, unless Zindle isn't a borogove. So, either the galumphing happened or Zindle isn't a borogove. Which would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x,c)) \u2228 \u00acN(a). Which is equivalent to \u00acN(a) \u2228 \u2203x..., which is the same as the implication. However, in formal logic, the implication is often preferred when there's a conditional structure. But the problem doesn't specify, so either could be acceptable. But perhaps the correct answer is the implication. Let me check the example again. The example uses implication for a universal. But here, the structure is different. Since the sentence is about an existential statement, perhaps the implication is better. But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is structured as \"There exists a rath that galumphed over Bungo unless Zindle isn't a borogove.\" So, the \"unless\" applies to the entire existence. So, if Zindle is a borogove, then there exists a rath... So the implication is correct. Therefore, the answer is N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)).\n\nYes, that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\nN(a)\u2192\u2203x(Ox\u2227Q(x,c))",

The sentence to formalize is: \"A rath galumphed over Bungo only if every rath chortled at Rafin.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"[1] is a rath\", Q for \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", c is Bungo, P for \"[1] chortled at [2]\", and b is Rafin.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The structure is \"A rath galumphed over Bungo only if every rath chortled at Rafin.\" The \"only if\" part is crucial here. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So, the entire sentence can be seen as: If there exists a rath that galumphed over Bungo, then every rath chortled at Rafin.\n\nBreaking it down, the antecedent (A) is \"A rath galumphed over Bungo,\" which would be an existential quantifier: there exists some x such that O(x) (x is a rath) and Q(x, c) (x galumphed over Bungo, since c is Bungo). The consequent (B) is \"every rath chortled at Rafin,\" which is a universal quantifier: for all y, if O(y) (y is a rath), then P(y, b) (y chortled at Rafin, since b is Rafin).\n\nPutting that together, the formula should be: \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyb). \n\nWait, but I need to check if the \"only if\" is correctly captured. Yes, because \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So the existence of a rath galumphing over Bungo implies that all raths chortled at Rafin.\n\nI need to make sure that the variables are properly quantified. The antecedent uses \u2203x, and the consequent uses \u2200y. Since they are different variables, that's okay. Also, the predicates are applied correctly with the right arguments. Q takes x and c (Bungo), and P takes y and b (Rafin). \n\nNo need to use any other connectives beyond implication here. The existential is combined with the conjunction of being a rath and performing the action. The universal is for all raths, they must have chortled at Rafin. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check. The original sentence says that the galumphing happened only if all raths chortled. So if the galumphing did happen, then the chortling must have happened. Which matches the implication direction. Yes. So the formalization should be as I wrote.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Pyb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to translate is: \"Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle unless every tove will burble.\" The abbreviations given are P for \"[1] chortled at [2]\", c for Bungo, a for Zindle, M for \"[1] is a tove\", and G for \"[1] will burble\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The key part here is \"didn't chortle... unless...\". In logic, \"unless\" can often be translated using implications. The general structure of \"A unless B\" is usually equivalent to \"If not B, then A\" or \"If A is not the case, then B\". Wait, actually, I think it's more accurate to say that \"A unless B\" translates to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\", meaning that if B is not true, then A must be true. Alternatively, it can also be represented as \"A \u2228 B\". But here, the sentence is \"Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle unless every tove will burble.\" So in this case, the structure is \"\u00acP unless G for all toves\". \n\nBreaking it down: The original sentence can be rephrased as \"If not every tove will burble, then Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle.\" Or conversely, \"Bungo chortled at Zindle only if every tove will burble.\" So the implication here would be that if Bungo did chortle at Zindle, then every tove must burble. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. \n\nLet me recall that \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\", but also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Let me check. Suppose the sentence is \"I will go unless it rains.\" That would mean \"I will go or it rains,\" and also \"If it does not rain, then I will go.\" So applying that here, \"Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle unless every tove will burble\" would be equivalent to \"\u00acP(c, a) \u2228 G(...)\", but the \"every tove will burble\" part is a universal statement. \n\nSo the \"unless\" clause is \"every tove will burble\", which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). Therefore, the entire sentence can be written as \u00acP(ca) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). However, using the implication form of \"unless\", which is \u00acB \u2192 A. Wait, if we structure it as \"A unless B\" is \u00acB \u2192 A. So here, A is \"Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle\" (\u00acP(ca)), and B is \"every tove will burble\" (\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)). Therefore, the translation would be \u00acB \u2192 A, which is \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)) \u2192 \u00acP(ca). But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct translation is that \"Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle unless B' \" is equivalent to \"If not B, then \u00acP\". Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the direction. Let's use the example from the user. The example given was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" translated as \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So for \"unless\", let's think of the sentence as \"\u00acP(ca) unless \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)\". According to standard translations, \"A unless B\" is B \u2228 A. So here, the sentence would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2228 \u00acP(ca). But in predicate logic, we usually prefer implications over disjunctions when possible, but maybe here the disjunction is acceptable. However, since the example uses implication, perhaps we need to use implication here as well.\n\nAlternatively, using material implication, A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. So if we have \"B unless A\" is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B\". Wait, let me get this straight. Let's say \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"If not B, then A\". So in this case, \"Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle unless every tove will burble\" would be: If it is not the case that every tove will burble, then Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle. So \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)) \u2192 \u00acP(c,a). \n\nBut another way to think about it is that the original statement is saying that the only way Bungo chortled at Zindle is if every tove will burble. Which would translate to P(c,a) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nWhich of these is correct? Let's check with truth tables. Let me consider \"A unless B\" as equivalent to \"If not B, then A\" and also \"If A is not the case, then B\". Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me take the example: \"I will go unless it rains.\" This means that if it doesn't rain, I will go. So \u00acB \u2192 A, where A is \"I will go\", B is \"it rains\". It also can be phrased as \"A \u2228 B\". So in the original problem, the sentence is \"Bungo didn't chortle... unless every tove will burble.\" So that would be \"\u00acP unless B\", where B is \"every tove will burble\". So this would be equivalent to \"B \u2228 \u00acP\", which is the same as \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acP\". Alternatively, it's equivalent to \"P \u2192 B\". \n\nSo both forms are acceptable. The question is which one to use here. Since the example uses implication (the example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc)), perhaps the expected answer is to use implication. \n\nSo if we take the form P \u2192 B, where P is \"Bungo chortled at Zindle\" (so \u00acP is the original statement's main part), then the translation would be P(ca) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). But the original sentence is \"Bungo didn't chortle... unless...\", which is equivalent to \u00acP unless B, which is equivalent to P \u2192 B. Therefore, the correct formalization would be P(ca) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence is \"Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle unless every tove will burble.\" So \"unless\" introduces a condition. So the condition is that if the condition (every tove will burble) is not met, then Bungo didn't chortle. So \u00acB \u2192 \u00acP. Which is equivalent to P \u2192 B. So both are equivalent. \n\nNow, considering the abbreviations given: P is \"[1] chortled at [2]\", so P(c,a) is \"Bungo chortled at Zindle\". The negation of that is \u00acP(c,a). The \"unless\" clause is \"every tove will burble\", which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx), because M is \"[1] is a tove\" and G is \"[1] will burble\". \n\nTherefore, the formalization can be written as either \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(c,a) or P(c,a) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). Both are logically equivalent. However, which one is preferred? The example given uses a universal quantifier with implication, so perhaps the second form is more in line with the example's style. \n\nLooking at the example: \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So they use the implication direction where the antecedent is the predicate (Lx) leading to the consequent (Rxc). Similarly, here, if we take the form P \u2192 B, then it's P(ca) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). This would be a well-formed formula. \n\nAlternatively, if we use \u00acB \u2192 \u00acP, it would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(c,a). But in predicate logic, the negation of a universal quantifier is an existential quantifier. So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00ac(Mx \u2192 Gx)), which simplifies to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx). However, when writing the implication, it's perhaps more straightforward to use the P \u2192 B form. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be P(c,a) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). However, the original sentence says \"Bungo didn't chortle...\", so maybe I need to check again. Wait, the original sentence is \u00acP unless B. So \u00acP \u2228 B. Which is equivalent to P \u2192 B. \n\nYes, so the correct formalization is P(c,a) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nLet me make sure I didn't mix up the direction. If the sentence is \"A unless B\", then it's A \u2228 B. Which is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. Wait no, A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. Wait, let me recall: A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. So if the original is \"\u00acP unless B\", that is \u00acP \u2228 B, which is equivalent to P \u2192 B. \n\nYes, exactly. Therefore, the correct formalization is P(ca) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be: \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2190 Pca? Wait, no. The implication is P(ca) \u2192 \u2200x(...). So in symbols, it's Pca \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nBut let me check again. The sentence is \"Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle unless every tove will burble.\" So \"unless\" here is like \"if not... then...\". So if it's not the case that every tove will burble, then Bungo didn't chortle. Which is \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)) \u2192 \u00acP(ca). Which is equivalent to P(ca) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nYes, so either form is correct, but which one to choose? The example uses a universal quantifier with implication. Since the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, and both forms are valid, but perhaps the expected answer is the implication from P to the universal statement. \n\nTherefore, the final formalization is Pca \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nBut let me check once more. Suppose \"Bungo didn't chortle... unless...\" means that the only way he chortled is if the condition is met. So if he did chortle, then the condition must hold. Which is exactly P \u2192 B. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is P(c,a) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nNow, translating that into symbols with the given abbreviations. P is \"[1] chortled at [2]\", so P applied to c and a is Pca. The universal quantifier is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). So the entire formula is Pca \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2190 Pca? No, in standard syntax, it's Pca \u2192 \u2200x(...). \n\nYes. So the answer is: Pca \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nI think that's correct. Let me make sure there are no other interpretations. Another way someone might misinterpret is thinking that \"unless\" requires a biconditional, but no, \"unless\" is typically a one-directional implication. \n\nSo the final answer should be Pca \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx).\n</think>\n\nPca\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to tackle this problem. So the task is to translate the given sentence into formal predicate logic using the provided abbreviations. Let's start by breaking down the sentence step by step.\n\nThe sentence is: \"If Rafin won't whiffle, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the structure. The main conditional here is \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the structure is a bit tricky. Let me rephrase it. The sentence is structured as: If A, then (B only if C). So the main connective is an implication where the consequent is a \"only if\" statement.\n\nIn logic, \"only if\" translates to an implication where the first part is the consequent. So \"B only if C\" becomes B \u2192 C. So the overall structure would be A \u2192 (B \u2192 C).\n\nNow let's identify A, B, and C in the original sentence.\n\nA: Rafin won't whiffle. The abbreviation for \"will whiffle\" is F, and since the subject is Rafin, which is denoted by b, this would be \u00acFb.\n\nB: every rath chortled at Bungo. The abbreviation for \"is a rath\" is O, \"chortled at\" is P, and Bungo is c. So \"every rath chortled at Bungo\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc).\n\nC: every rath galumphed over Rafin. \"Galumphed over\" is Q, and Rafin is b. So this is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb).\n\nPutting this all together, the main structure is \u00acFb \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)].\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is correct. The original sentence says \"every rath chortled at Bungo only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" So the \"only if\" connects the two universal statements. Therefore, the consequent of the main implication is (B \u2192 C), which would be [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)] \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)].\n\nSo the entire formula is \u00acFb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) ).\n\nNow, I should check if there's any possible ambiguity. The original sentence's structure is a conditional where the consequent is an \"only if\" between two universal statements. The translation seems to capture that. Also, the variables are all bound correctly with \u2200x. The abbreviations are correctly applied: F for whiffle with b, P with c, Q with b. \n\nAnother thing to verify is whether the quantifiers are properly scoped. In both B and C, the universal quantifier applies to the entire implication, which is correct because it's saying for every x, if x is a rath, then it does P or Q. \n\nI don't see any other parts that need to be adjusted. So the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acFb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) )\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Let me make sure that the parentheses are correctly placed. The main implication is \u00acFb leading to the entire (B \u2192 C). So yes, the structure is correct. Also, the variables in both quantifiers are x; since they are separate quantifiers, using the same variable is acceptable as they are in different scopes. Alternatively, one could use different variables, but since they are both universally quantified and the scope is clear, it's fine. The problem doesn't specify to avoid variable reuse in different scopes, so this should be okay.\n\nTherefore, the formalization is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00acFb\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxc)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"Not all raths will whiffle and every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"[1] is a rath\", F for \"[1] will whiffle\", Q for \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", and b for \"Rafin\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its two parts connected by \"and\". The first part is \"Not all raths will whiffle,\" and the second part is \"every rath galumphed over Rafin.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all raths will whiffle.\" In predicate logic, \"all A are B\" is typically formalized as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). So \"not all A are B\" would be the negation of that, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). Alternatively, this can also be expressed using an existential quantifier: \u2203x(Ax \u2227 \u00acBx). Both are equivalent due to the rules of quantifier negation. Here, \"raths\" are O, and \"will whiffle\" is F. So applying that, the first part becomes \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) or \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx). Since the original sentence uses \"not all,\" maybe the first form is more direct, but both are correct. However, in formal logic, sometimes the existential form is preferred for certain contexts, but the problem doesn't specify, so either is acceptable. Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the negation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) for the first part.\n\nNow the second part: \"every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" Using the same structure as the example, this would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb), since \"galumphed over Rafin\" translates to Q with the first argument being the rath and the second being b (Rafin).\n\nPutting them together with \"and\", which is \u2227. So the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nWait, but sometimes variables can be reused, but here the two universal quantifiers are separate. However, in the first part, the quantifier is negated. Let me confirm the structure again. The first part is \"Not all raths will whiffle,\" which is the negation of \"All raths will whiffle,\" so \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx). The second part is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). So the entire formula is the conjunction of these two. \n\nIs there any issue with variable capture or scope here? Since the variables in the first and second parts are separate, but in standard logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers. So even if both use x, they are different bound variables. So it's okay. Therefore, the final formula should be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb). Alternatively, if we want to use different variables for clarity, but since the problem doesn't require it and variables are just placeholders, using x in both is acceptable. \n\nAnother way to check: in the example, they used x in the universal quantifier. So following that, using x in both parts here is correct. \n\nTherefore, the formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb). \n\nLet me double-check each part. \n\nFirst part: \"Not all raths will whiffle.\" If I use \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx), that's equivalent. But the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both forms are correct, but maybe the example uses the universal form. The example for \"Every linguist...\" uses \u2200, so the negation would be \u00ac\u2200. So I think that's the way to go here. \n\nSecond part: \"every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" That's straightforward \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nSo combining them with \u2227, the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb). \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes here. The abbreviations are used properly, and the logical structure matches the English sentence.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb)",

The sentence is: \"A borogove will burble and only toves gimbled.\" The abbreviations given are N, G, M, I. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. Let's break it down. \"A borogove will burble\" \u2013 so there's an existence of a borogove that burbles. Then the second part is \"and only toves gimbled.\" That part is a bit tricky. The phrase \"only toves gimbled\" probably means that if something is gimbled, then it must be a tove. So \"only toves\" are the ones that gimbled. \n\nSo the first part: \"A borogove will burble\" translates to there exists an x such that N(x) (x is a borogove) and G(x) (x will burble). So \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx).\n\nThe second part: \"only toves gimbled.\" The word \"only\" here suggests that if something has been gimbled, then it must be a tove. Wait, but the abbreviation I is \"[1] gimbled.\" Wait, maybe I need to check the abbreviations again. \n\nThe abbreviations are:\nN: [1] is a borogove\nG: [1] will burble\nM: [1] is a tove\nI: [1] gimbled\n\nWait, the original sentence says \"only toves gimbled.\" So maybe \"gimbled\" here is a past tense action. So \"only toves\" were the ones that gimbled. So for any x, if x gimbled (I(x)), then x is a tove (M(x)). So that's \u2200x(Ix \u2192 Mx).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is two separate statements connected by \"and\". So the formalization would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2200x(Ix \u2192 Mx). \n\nWait, but the original sentence is \"A borogove will burble and only toves gimbled.\" The \"and\" connects the two clauses. So yes, the two parts are conjoined. \n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers are correctly applied. The first part is an existential quantifier for the borogove that burbles. The second part is a universal quantifier stating that anything that gimbled is a tove. \n\nSo combining them with \u2227, the entire formula would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2200x(Ix \u2192 Mx). \n\nI should check if there are any other possible interpretations. For example, could \"only toves gimbled\" mean that all toves have gimbled? No, because \"only\" here is restrictive. Like \"Only students passed\" translates to \u2200x(Px \u2192 Sx), where Px is passed and Sx is student. So similarly, \"only toves gimbled\" would be \u2200x(Ix \u2192 Mx). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the final formula is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Gx)\u2227\u2200x(Ix\u2192Mx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this logic problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the sentence is: \"If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo.\"\n\nThe abbreviations given are:\n- N: [1] is a borogove\n- R: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\n- b: Rafin\n- M: [1] is a tove\n- Q: [1] galumphed over [2]\n- a: Zindle\n- c: Bungo\n\nSo the main structure is an implication. The first part is \"If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin...\" which translates to an existential statement, right? Because \"a borogove\" implies there exists one. So that would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). Wait, because \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" means there exists some borogove (x) such that x snicker-snacked b (Rafin). So yes, \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb).\n\nThen the consequence is \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo.\" Let's parse that. The phrase \"only if\" in logic usually sets up a conditional where the \"only if\" part is the consequent. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. \n\nBut here, the main part is \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo.\" Let's denote:\n\nLet me rephrase the consequence: The statement is that \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is true only if \"Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo\". So that would translate to: (Not all toves galumphed over Zindle) \u2192 (\u00acQac). \n\nBut \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is equivalent to \"there exists a tove that did not galumph over Zindle.\" In predicate logic, \"not all Mx satisfy Qxa\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxa), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). \n\nSo putting that together, the consequence is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxa) \u2192 \u00acQac. Wait, but the original says \"only if Zindle didn't...\", so the entire implication is that if \"not all toves...\" then \"Zindle didn't...\". Wait no, the structure is \"A only if B\" which is A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"not all toves...\", B is \"Zindle didn't...\". So the consequence is A \u2192 B, where A is the \"not all...\" part and B is \u00acQac.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire original sentence is:\n\nIf [\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)] then [ (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxa)) \u2192 \u00acQac ]\n\nSo combining these, the whole formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 \u00acQac)\n\nBut wait, implications can be nested. Let me check the structure again. The main connective is the \"if... then...\" which is the outer implication. The then part is \"not all... only if...\", which is another implication. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify the inner implication. Since A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B, but maybe it's better to leave it as an implication for clarity. \n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any quantifier scopes that need to be considered? The \u2203x in the antecedent is about borogoves, and the \u2200x in the consequent is about toves. The variables are different, so no conflict. \n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 \u00acQac)\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the \"not all toves...\" part. The negation of \"all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is indeed \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa), which can also be written as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). However, in the implication, we can use either form. Since the original uses \"not all\", maybe it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(...). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the existential form. Let me think. The original says \"not all toves...\", which is equivalent to \"there exists a tove that does not...\", but since the \"only if\" is connecting the \"not all...\" to another statement, perhaps keeping it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) is acceptable. \n\nBut in formal logic, sometimes it's preferable to use the equivalent forms. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations for \"galumphed over\" is Q, so the statement about toves is using M (is a tove) and Q. So the formula should be correct as written.\n\nAnother thing to check: The \"only if\" is correctly translated. The original sentence says that the \"not all toves...\" is true only if \"Zindle didn't...\". So that's A only if B, which is A \u2192 B. So yes, the inner implication is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 \u00acQac)\n\nBut wait, there's a possible confusion with variable x here. In the antecedent, x is a borogove, and in the consequent, x is a tove. Since they are different x's, but in predicate logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers. However, in the way I wrote it, the second part uses \u2200x... which would bind x again. But since the entire consequent is an implication, the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent are separate. So that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, maybe use different variables, but since the problem doesn't mention variables, and the abbreviations don't specify, I think it's acceptable. Because in the formalization, each quantifier introduces its own x. So the first \u2203x is for borogoves, and the \u2200x in the consequent is for toves. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 \u00acQac)\n\nBut wait, another way to write implications: A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. Maybe that's a more standard way. Let me check. \n\nOriginal: If P, then (Q \u2192 R). Which is P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R). But this is logically equivalent to (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 R. \n\nSo perhaps the problem expects it in that form. Let me see. \n\nSo the original implication is \u2203x... \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 \u00acQac). Which can be rewritten as (\u2203x... \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x...) \u2192 \u00acQac. \n\nBut which form is correct? Both are equivalent. However, the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are acceptable. However, in some contexts, nested implications can be harder to read. But since the problem didn't specify any preference, either form is correct. \n\nBut let's stick to the original structure as per the sentence. The sentence says \"then not all toves... only if Zindle...\". The \"only if\" is part of the consequence of the main implication. Therefore, keeping it as \u2203x... \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 \u00acQac) is accurate. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is as above. \n\nLet me just double-check each part:\n\n- \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" becomes \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb). Correct.\n\n- \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). Correct.\n\n- \"only if Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo\" translates to \u2192 \u00acQac. \n\nSo the entire consequence is \u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 \u00acQac. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the whole formula is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 \u00acQac)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this logic problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the sentence says: \"If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all toves will whiffle only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\"\n\nLet me parse the structure. The main conditional is \"If A, then B\", where A is \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\" and B is \"not all toves will whiffle only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\" Using the abbreviations, O is [1] is a rath, R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], and c is Bungo. So translating A would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent B: \"not all toves will whiffle only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\" Let me rephrase this. The phrase \"only if\" in logic usually sets up a conditional where the necessary condition is on the right. So \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. \n\nBut here, the structure is \"not all toves will whiffle only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\" Let me parse \"not all toves will whiffle.\" \"Not all\" is equivalent to \"there exists at least one tove that does not whiffle.\" So \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx) is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). \n\nSo the entire consequent is: [\u00ac\u2200Mx\u2192Fx] only if Paa (since Zindle chortled at Zindle is Paa, with a being Zindle). \n\nTranslating \"only if\" as a conditional, this becomes: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Paa. Wait, but the original is \"not all toves will whiffle only if Paa.\" So the structure is (Not all toves whiffle) only if Paa. Which would translate to: If (not all toves whiffle), then Paa. So that's \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Paa. Alternatively, since \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx), we can write \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2192 Paa. \n\nSo putting the whole conditional together: The original sentence is \"If A, then B\", so the entire formula is A \u2192 B. Substituting A and B:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Paa]\n\nBut let me check if I need to use the abbreviations correctly. The abbreviations for M is [1] is a tove, F is [1] will whiffle. So yes, Mx for x is a tove, Fx for x will whiffle. \n\nAnother thing to consider: The \"only if\" part. The original statement is \"not all toves will whiffle only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\" So \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So for \"not all toves will whiffle\" to be true, it's necessary that Paa is true. Hence, the implication is that if \"not all toves will whiffle\" is true, then Paa must be true. So that's indeed \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Paa.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Paa)\n\nAlternatively, since implications can be nested, this is equivalent to:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2192 Paa)\n\nBut the question says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both forms are acceptable, but perhaps using the negation of the universal is better here. \n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any other possible interpretations? Let me re-express the original sentence again. The consequent is \"not all toves will whiffle only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\" So \"only if\" can sometimes be tricky. Let me think of it as: The statement \"not all toves will whiffle\" can only be true if Paa is true. Therefore, if \"not all toves will whiffle\" is the case, then Paa must hold. So that's exactly the implication \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Paa. \n\nSo combining everything, the final formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Paa)\n\nBut in predicate logic, it's acceptable to have nested implications. However, sometimes people prefer to rephrase implications using logical equivalences, but the problem says to use standard syntax, so this should be okay. \n\nLet me check if there's a need to use parentheses properly. The main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. The antecedent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc). The consequent is another implication: \u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 Paa. So the entire formula is correctly structured with parentheses.\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)\u2192Paa)\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any abbreviations. Let me check again:\n\n- O: rath\n- R: snicker-snacked [2], so Rxc means x snicker-snacked c (Bungo)\n- M: tove\n- F: will whiffle\n- P: chortled at [2], so Paa is Zindle chortled at Zindle (a is Zindle)\nYes, all abbreviations are correctly used. \n\nAnother point: The original sentence uses \"will whiffle\" which is future tense, but in the abbreviation F is \"[1] will whiffle\", so that's correct. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me write the final formula without spaces as per the example:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)\u2192Paa)\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)\u2192Paa)",

The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If Zindle won't burble, then...\" So the antecedent is \"Zindle won't burble,\" and the consequent is the rest of the sentence. Using the abbreviations, Zindle is 'a' and 'G' is \"[1] will burble,\" so the antecedent is \u00acGa.\n\nNow the consequent: \"a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\" Let's parse this. The phrase \"only if\" usually translates to an implication where the necessary condition is the consequent. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. \n\nSo the first part is \"a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a borogove\" is N, and \"snicker-snacked\" is R. But since it's \"a borogove,\" we need an existential quantifier here. Wait, but the original says \"a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo\"\u2014so there exists some borogove that did that. So that would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc), since Bungo is 'c'.\n\nThen the \"only if\" part is \"every rath chortled at Bungo.\" \"Every rath\" translates to \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Py c), where O is \"[1] is a rath\" and P is \"[1] chortled at [2]\".\n\nPutting that together, the consequent is (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Py c)).\n\nSo combining the antecedent and consequent, the whole statement is \u00acGa \u2192 [ (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Py c)) ].\n\nWait, but in logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, since the consequent is a material implication, the entire formula would be \u00acGa \u2192 ( (\u2203x Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) ). But I need to check if that's correctly structured. The existential quantifier is part of the antecedent of the inner implication. So yes, that's correct. \n\nLet me make sure I didn't mix up any parts. The original says if Zindle won't burble, then [A only if B], which is A \u2192 B. So the structure is \u00acGa \u2192 (A \u2192 B), where A is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) and B is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula is \u00acGa \u2192 (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc)). \n\nI should check if there are any parentheses issues. The main connective is the implication between \u00acGa and the rest. Then inside, the implication between the existential and the universal. So the parentheses are correctly placed. Also, variables x and y are properly bound by their quantifiers. No free variables here. That should do it.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Pyc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is \"A rath is beamish or every tove galumphed over Rafin.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"[1] is a rath,\" L for \"[1] is beamish,\" M for \"[1] is a tove,\" Q for \"[1] galumphed over [2],\" and b for \"Rafin.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main connective here is \"or,\" which in logic is typically represented by \u2228. So the sentence is a disjunction between two parts: \"A rath is beamish\" and \"every tove galumphed over Rafin.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"A rath is beamish.\" The word \"a\" here suggests an existential quantifier because it's referring to the existence of at least one rath that is beamish. So, using the abbreviations, this would translate to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). Wait, but sometimes \"a\" can be ambiguous. However, in formal logic, when we say \"A X is Y,\" it's usually interpreted as there exists an X that is Y. So yes, existential quantifier with conjunction.\n\nNow the second part: \"every tove galumphed over Rafin.\" The word \"every\" indicates a universal quantifier. So for all x, if x is a tove (Mx), then x galumphed over Rafin (Qx b). So that would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is the disjunction of these two parts. So the formalization would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2228 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nWait, but need to check if the variables are properly scoped. Since the two parts of the disjunction are separate, their quantifiers are independent. So the first part uses \u2203x and the second uses \u2200x. That's acceptable because they are different quantifiers and the variables can reuse x as they are bound within their own scope.\n\nSo the final formula should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). Let me double-check the abbreviations to make sure I didn't mix up any letters. O is for rath, L for beamish, M for tove, Q for galumphed over, and b is Rafin. Yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother thing to verify is the structure of the galumphed over part. Since Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2],\" the first argument is the subject (the tove) and the second is the object (Rafin). So Qxb where x is the tove and b is Rafin. So yes, \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) is correct.\n\nSo the entire formula is correct as written. No mistakes detected. The disjunction connects the two statements properly. The first part says there exists a beamish rath, the second that all toves galumphed over Rafin. The use of \u2228 between them matches the original sentence's \"or.\"\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"Rafin gimbled and Rafin isn't uffish.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. It has two parts connected by \"and\": \"Rafin gimbled\" and \"Rafin isn't uffish.\" \n\nLooking at the abbreviations provided:\n- I: [1] gimbled. So, if I use I with a term, it would mean that term gimbled. Since the subject is Rafin, which is abbreviated as b, then \"Rafin gimbled\" should be Ib.\n\nThen the second part: \"Rafin isn't uffish.\" The abbreviation K is [1] is uffish. So, \"Rafin is uffish\" would be Kb. But since it's \"isn't uffish,\" we need to negate that. So, \u00acKb.\n\nNow, connecting these two parts with \"and.\" In logic, \"and\" is represented by the conjunction symbol \u2227. So, combining Ib and \u00acKb with \u2227 gives us Ib \u2227 \u00acKb.\n\nI should check if there are any quantifiers needed. The original sentence is about Rafin specifically, and since b is a constant (Rafin), there's no need for universal or existential quantifiers here. The sentence is a straightforward conjunction of two predicates applied to the same individual.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization should be Ib \u2227 \u00acKb. Let me double-check the abbreviations to make sure I didn't mix up any symbols. I is for gimbled, K for uffish, and b is Rafin. Yep, that looks right. The negation is correctly placed on K, and the conjunction connects the two statements. No quantifiers needed here. Alright, I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nIb \u2227 \u00acKb",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is \"Bungo isn't a borogove if and only if no toves will burble.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"[1] is a borogove\", c is Bungo, M for \"[1] is a tove\", and G for \"[1] will burble\".\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a biconditional (if and only if) between two parts: \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" and \"no toves will burble.\"\n\nStarting with the left side of the biconditional: \"Bungo isn't a borogove.\" Since N is the predicate for being a borogove, and c is Bungo, this would be \u00acNc. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow the right side: \"no toves will burble.\" \"No toves\" means there doesn't exist a tove. So, in predicate logic, \"no toves will burble\" can be expressed as \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Gx). Here, Mx is \"x is a tove\" and Gx is \"x will burble.\" So the combination says \"there exists an x that is a tove and will burble,\" and the negation of that is \"no such x exists,\" which matches \"no toves will burble.\"\n\nPutting it all together with the biconditional (\u2194), the entire formula should be \u00acNc \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Gx). Wait, but let me check if I got the biconditional direction right. The original says \"Bungo isn't a borogove if and only if no toves will burble.\" So it's \u00acNc \u2194 (no toves burble). Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \"no toves will burble\" can also be phrased as \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx), which means for all x, if x is a tove, then it won't burble. But both \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Gx) and \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx) are logically equivalent. So either could be used. However, since the problem asks for the formalization using standard syntax, either form is acceptable. But maybe the more direct translation of \"no toves will burble\" is the negation of existence. Let me think. The sentence says \"no toves will burble,\" which is a universal statement. So perhaps \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx) is better. Wait, but the original instruction says to use the abbreviations provided. Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" was translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they used the universal quantifier with implication. So for \"no toves will burble,\" the equivalent would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Because \"no toves\" is a universal statement. So maybe I should use that form instead of the negated existential. Let me verify. The two are equivalent via quantifier duality. Since \u00ac\u2203x P(x) is equivalent to \u2200x \u00acP(x). But here P(x) is Mx \u2227 Gx. So \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Gx) is equivalent to \u2200x \u00ac(Mx \u2227 Gx), which by De Morgan's law is \u2200x (\u00acMx \u2228 \u00acGx), which is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Therefore, both forms are correct. However, in the example, they used the universal quantifier with implication for \"every linguist,\" so following that pattern, maybe \"no toves will burble\" is better expressed as \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Therefore, the right-hand side of the biconditional should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx).\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx).\n\nWait, but the original sentence is \"Bungo isn't a borogove if and only if no toves will burble.\" So \"no toves will burble\" is equivalent to \"for all toves, they won't burble,\" which is the universal statement. Therefore, using the universal quantifier is appropriate here. So the correct formalization would be \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx).\n\nBut let me check again. If I use \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Gx), is that acceptable? The example used \u2200 for \"every,\" but maybe both forms are acceptable. However, given that the problem says \"no toves will burble,\" which is a negative universal, perhaps the expected answer is the universal quantifier version. Let me think again. In predicate logic, \"no A are B\" is typically formalized as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 \u00acB(x)). So in this case, \"no toves will burble\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Therefore, the correct formalization is \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the formula is \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Let me check the abbreviations again. N is [1] is a borogove, so \u00acNc is correct for \"Bungo isn't a borogove.\" M is [1] is a tove, G is [1] will burble. So yes, Mx \u2192 \u00acGx for each x. Therefore, the final formula should be \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx).\n</think>\n\n\u00acNc\u2194\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acGx)",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. \n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If every borogove is mimsy, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" So the overall form is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", where A, B, and C are sub-statements.\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"every borogove is mimsy.\" Using the abbreviations, N is \"[1] is a borogove\" and J is \"[1] is mimsy.\" So this part would translate to \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). That's straightforward, similar to the example given.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is usually translated as P \u2192 Q. But here, P is \"Zindle galumphed over Bungo,\" and Q is \"every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" However, there's a negation here: \"Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo.\" So the entire consequent is \"\u00acQ only if R,\" where Q is \"Zindle galumphed...\" and R is \"every borogove chortled...\"\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase. The structure is \"Z didn't galumph over B only if every borogove chortled at B.\" So \"only if\" here connects the negation of galumphing with the universal statement about chortling. \n\nIn logical terms, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. But here, A is \"Z didn't galumph...\" So if we let A be \u00acQ(a, c), then the \"only if\" would be A \u2192 B, where B is the universal statement. Wait, no. Wait, the standard translation is that \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So if the sentence is \"Z didn't galumph... only if every borogove chortled...\", then P is \"Z didn't galumph...\" and Q is \"every borogove chortled...\". Therefore, it would be P \u2192 Q. \n\nBut let me confirm. Let's say \"I will go to the party only if you go.\" That translates to \"If I go, then you go.\" Similarly, \"Z didn't galumph... only if every borogove chortled...\" would be \"If Z didn't galumph..., then every borogove chortled...\" Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Wait, maybe I have it backwards. \n\nWait, \"only if\" introduces a necessary condition. So \"A only if B\" means that B is necessary for A. So A can only happen if B is true. Therefore, A \u2192 B. For example, \"You can have dessert only if you finish your vegetables.\" So having dessert requires finishing vegetables. So if you have dessert, then you must have finished vegetables. So A \u2192 B.\n\nSo in our case, \"Z didn't galumph over B only if every borogove chortled at B.\" So the statement is that \"Z didn't galumph...\" can only be true if \"every borogove chortled...\" So if \"Z didn't galumph...\" is true, then \"every borogove chortled...\" must be true. Therefore, the translation would be \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nBut wait, the original consequent is \"Z didn't galumph over B only if every borogove chortled at B.\" So the structure is \"\u00acQ only if C\", which is \u00acQ \u2192 C. Therefore, the entire consequent is \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx), then [\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c))]. So the main connective is a conditional (\u2192) between the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations again. The abbreviations are:\n\nN: [1] is a borogove (so Nx means x is a borogove)\nJ: [1] is mimsy (Jx)\nQ: [1] galumphed over [2] (Q(a,c) is Zindle galumphed over Bungo)\na: Zindle\nc: Bungo\nP: [1] chortled at [2] (so P(x,c) is x chortled at Bungo)\n\nSo the universal statement in the consequent is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)))\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can write implications nested. However, we need to make sure the quantifiers are properly scoped. Let me check if the variables are correctly bound.\n\nThe antecedent is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). The consequent is \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)). Here, the second \u2200x is a separate quantifier, which is fine. The variable x in the second quantifier is bound within its own scope. So that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))\n\nBut since the problem says to use the abbreviations and the variables, and the constants a and c, we can write it as:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200y(Ny\u2192Pyc))\n\nWait, but in the example, they used x again in the second universal quantifier. The example had \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). But in logic, variables can be reused as long as they are bound properly. However, in practice, when you have two universal quantifiers, you can use the same variable if they are in separate scopes. However, in formal logic, it's often preferred to use different variables to avoid confusion, but technically, since they are in different scopes, it's allowed. However, the problem might not care as long as it's well-formed. \n\nBut in the example, they used x again. Let me check the example again. The example was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). If there were another quantifier, they would use x again. So perhaps here, the second \u2200x is acceptable. However, if we use x again, then in the consequent, the second \u2200x is okay. However, in some formal systems, variables must be unique, but in standard predicate logic, it's allowed as long as the scopes don't interfere. \n\nTherefore, the formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))\n\nBut maybe to make it clearer, we can use a different variable for the second universal quantifier. However, since the problem doesn't specify, and the example uses x again, perhaps it's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the variables to be distinct. But since the example uses x again, I think it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))\n\nBut let's check if that's the correct structure. The entire sentence is a conditional where the antecedent is the universal statement, and the consequent is another conditional. So yes, the main operator is \u2192 between the two parts.\n\nAnother way to write implications is that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to translate directly, so we need to preserve the structure. The original sentence is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which we translated as A \u2192 (\u00acB \u2192 C), where B is Qac. Wait, no, the consequent is \"Z didn't galumph... only if every borogove chortled...\", which is \u00acQac only if \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc), which is \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc). Therefore, the entire consequent is that implication. So the whole formula is A \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc)).\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formula is as above.\n\nNow, let's write it with proper symbols. The user wants the answer in standard predicate logic syntax, using \u2200, \u2203, the connectives, etc. So the formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nBut to make sure that the quantifiers are properly placed, perhaps using parentheses. However, in standard syntax, the implication is right-associative? Or do we need parentheses? Well, the structure is clear as written. \n\nAlternatively, since implications are associative in a way, but to avoid confusion, parentheses are added. So the formula is correct as written. \n\nTherefore, the final translation is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))\n\nI think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"Not all toves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break it down. The sentence has two parts connected by \"and\": \"Not all toves will whiffle\" and \"not all borogoves will whiffle.\" So I need to handle each part separately and then combine them with a logical AND (\u2227).\n\nStarting with \"Not all toves will whiffle.\" The phrase \"not all\" usually translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. In predicate logic, \"All A are B\" is \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). So \"Not all A are B\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Ax \u2227 \u00acBx), which means there exists some A that is not B. But maybe the original form is better here.\n\nSo for the first part: \"Not all toves will whiffle.\" Using abbreviations M for tove and F for will whiffle. So it's \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). Similarly for the second part: \"Not all borogoves will whiffle.\" Borogove is N, so \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Fx). Then combine both with \u2227.\n\nWait, but in predicate logic, when you have two separate quantifiers, you need to make sure they are properly scoped. So the entire formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Fx). But I need to check if the variables are correctly used. Each quantifier uses the same variable x, but since they are separate statements connected by \u2227, that's okay. Each quantifier is separate. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use different variables, but in the example given, they used the same variable for different parts. For example, in the example, they had \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), so same x. But here, since we have two separate universal statements, each negated, I think it's acceptable to use the same variable because they are separate quantifiers. So each \u2203 or \u2200 is introducing a new scope. So the correct formalization would be (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx)) \u2227 (\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx)).\n\nAlternatively, could you have \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2227 \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acFx)? That would mean there exists a tove that doesn't whiffle and there exists a borogove that doesn't whiffle. But the original sentence says \"Not all toves...\" which is equivalent to \"There exists at least one tove that does not whiffle.\" So both forms are equivalent. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The example used the universal quantifier with implication for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So following that pattern, \"Not all toves will whiffle\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx). Similarly for the borogoves. Therefore, combining them with \u2227 gives the entire formula. \n\nSo the final answer should be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Fx). Let me check again. The original sentence is \"Not all toves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.\" Yes, that seems right. Each part is a negation of a universal, and they are conjoined. So the formalization is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Fx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. First, I need to parse the sentence carefully. The sentence is: \"If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\"\n\nThe abbreviations provided are:\n- N: [1] is a borogove\n- R: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\n- b: Rafin\n- O: [1] is a rath\n- c: Bungo\n- P: [1] chortled at [2]\n- a: Zindle\n\nSo, breaking down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" and B is \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\" Since it's \"a borogove,\" that's an existential quantifier. So there exists some x that is a borogove (Nx) and x snicker-snacked Rafin (Rxb). So A is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb).\n\nNow the consequent B: \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"Q only if P\" translates to Q \u2192 P. So here, the statement is that for every rath, if they snicker-snacked Bungo, then Zindle chortled at Zindle.\n\nBreaking that down: For all y, if Oy (y is a rath) then (Ryc \u2192 Pac). Wait, because \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if...\" So the entire \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\" is the Q in \"Q only if P\". So Q is \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\", but that's not directly. Wait, maybe it's structured as: For every rath, if they snicker-snacked Bungo, then P must hold. Because \"only if\" introduces a necessary condition. So \"Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Pac\" would mean that for each rath, if they did Ryc, then Pac must be true. So \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ryc \u2192 Pac)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication is: If \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb), then \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ryc \u2192 Pac)).\n\nSo combining these, the formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ryc \u2192 Pac))\n\nNow checking the abbreviations again to make sure. The \"Zindle chortled at Zindle\" is Pac, since P is [1] chortled at [2], and a is Zindle, so Paa. Wait, no! Wait, the second argument is also Zindle. So P takes two arguments. The first is the one doing the chortling, the second is the one being chortled at. Since Zindle chortled at Zindle, that would be Paa (since a is Zindle).\n\nYes, so Pac was incorrect. Wait, in the abbreviations, c is Bungo. Oh no! Wait, the consequent part is about \"Zindle chortled at Zindle\", so it's P(a,a), since a is Zindle. Earlier I mistakenly wrote Pac, but that would be Zindle chortled at Bungo, which is not correct. So correction: the consequent in the inner implication is Paa.\n\nSo the correct part is Ryc \u2192 Paa. Therefore, the entire consequent is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ryc \u2192 Paa)).\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ryc \u2192 Paa))\n\nNow, checking if that's well-formed. The variables are properly quantified. The antecedent is an existential, the consequent is a universal. The connectives are properly placed. Yes, this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192(Ryc\u2192Paa))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is: \"If Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves are beamish.\" And we need to translate it into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. It's a conditional statement. The antecedent is \"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin,\" and the consequent is \"not all toves are beamish.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.\" The abbreviations given are R for \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\", c is Bungo, and b is Rafin. So, the action here is R with c as the first argument and b as the second. Since it's a negation, we need to negate that. So, \u00acRcb. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"not all toves are beamish.\" The abbreviations for that are M for \"[1] is a tove\" and L for \"[1] is beamish.\" The phrase \"all toves are beamish\" would typically be formalized as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). But since we have \"not all,\" that's the negation of that statement. So, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). Alternatively, using the equivalence between \"not all\" and \"there exists at least one that is not,\" this can also be written as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). But I need to check which form is more appropriate here. The original instruction says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so both forms are correct, but maybe the direct negation is better unless specified otherwise. However, the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax. Let me think. The original statement is \"not all toves are beamish,\" which is equivalent to \"It is not the case that for all x, if x is a tove, then x is beamish.\" So, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). Alternatively, using the existential quantifier, \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). Either way is logically equivalent. But since the example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier (like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), perhaps we should stick with the negation of the universal. But maybe the problem expects the existential form. Wait, let me recall that \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP. So here, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx) is equivalent to \u2203x\u00ac(Mx \u2192 Lx), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). Either form is acceptable. However, in formal logic, sometimes the negation of a universal is left as \u00ac\u2200... unless you need to push the negation inside. Since the problem says to return a well-formed formula, both are correct, but perhaps the most direct translation is to negate the universal. However, in practice, people often convert it to the existential. Let me check the example again. The example had \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the sentence was \"Not every linguist admires Charlie,\" that would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). But maybe the problem expects the negation of the universal as is. However, the consequent here is \"not all toves are beamish,\" which is \"not (all toves are beamish).\" Since \"all toves are beamish\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx), then \"not all\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). So I think that's the correct formalization here. But maybe the problem expects it in the existential form. Let me see. Since the example uses the universal, but the user might prefer the negated universal. However, perhaps in formal logic, it's more standard to convert the negation inside. But I need to make sure. The problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both forms are correct. However, perhaps the answer expects the existential quantifier. Let me think again. Let's take the original sentence: \"If Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves are beamish.\" So the consequent is \"not all toves are beamish,\" which is the negation of \"all toves are beamish.\" So the formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). Alternatively, \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). Which one is better? Since the example uses the universal, maybe the problem expects the negation of the universal. But maybe the answer is supposed to use the existential. Hmm. Let me check. Suppose we have \"Not all toves are beamish.\" The standard way to formalize this is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). Because \"not all\" is equivalent to \"there exists at least one that is not.\" So perhaps that's the better approach here. Let me confirm. The original statement is \"not all toves are beamish,\" which is logically equivalent to \"there exists a tove that is not beamish.\" Therefore, the correct formalization would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). So the consequent is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). Therefore, the entire conditional would be \u00acRcb \u2192 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). Alternatively, if we keep the negation outside the universal, it would be \u00acRcb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). Both are correct. But which one is preferred here? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are standard. However, the example uses the universal quantifier in the consequent. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which became \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So if the example had \"Not every linguist admires Charlie,\" it would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). But the problem's example doesn't have a negation. So perhaps the answer here can be either form. However, since the problem says \"not all toves are beamish,\" which is the negation of a universal statement, perhaps it's better to write it as \u00ac\u2200x(...). But maybe the answer expects the existential. Let me think. Since the user hasn't specified which form, but the example uses the universal, perhaps the answer is expected to use the negation of the universal. But I need to make sure. Let me check the logical equivalence. \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Lx) is equivalent to \u2203x \u00ac(Mx \u2192 Lx). And since \u00ac(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to A \u2227 \u00acB, then this becomes \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). So both forms are equivalent. However, depending on the problem's requirements, perhaps the answer is expected to use the existential. But since the problem says \"use standard predicate logic syntax,\" and both are standard, perhaps the answer can be either. But perhaps the problem expects the form with the existential. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"not all toves are beamish.\" If I were to formalize this, I would use \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). Because \"not all\" is a common way to express existence of a counterexample. So maybe that's the way to go. Therefore, the consequent is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire conditional is \u00acRcb \u2192 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). \n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations again. R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], so Rcb would be Bungo (c) snicker-snacked Rafin (b). The antecedent is \"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin,\" which is \u00acRcb. The consequent is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acRcb \u2192 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). \n\nAlternatively, if we had kept the negation of the universal, it would be \u00acRcb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). Both are correct. But which one is expected here? The example uses the universal in the positive case. Since the problem says to use the given abbreviations, and the abbreviations for \"is a tove\" and \"is beamish\" are M and L, respectively, then both forms are acceptable. However, perhaps the problem expects the existential form. Let me check if there's any other consideration. The problem says \"not all toves are beamish\" which is a negation of a universal, and in formal logic, when you negate a universal, it's often converted to an existential. But again, both are correct. \n\nBut given that the example uses the universal quantifier in the positive case, maybe the answer here is supposed to use the negation of the universal. However, the problem says \"return a single well-formed formula in standard predicate logic syntax.\" Both are standard. But perhaps the answer is supposed to be in the form with the existential. Let me think. For example, if the sentence was \"Not all students passed,\" that would be formalized as \u2203x (Student(x) \u2227 \u00acPassed(x)). So following that pattern, the answer here would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). Therefore, the entire formula is \u00acRcb \u2192 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). \n\nYes, that seems right. So I'll go with that. Therefore, the final formula is \u00acRcb \u2192 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx).\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcb\u2192\u2203x(Mx\u2227\u00acLx)",

The main quantifier is \"Every borogove,\" which translates to \u2200x(Nx \u2192 ...). The ... part is where the action happens. The action is that each borogove snicker-snacked every borogove that meets a certain condition.\n\nThe condition for the borogove being snicker-snacked is that they (the borogove) snicker-snacked every tove. So, for a borogove y to be snicker-snacked by x, y must be a borogove (Ny) and for all z, if z is a tove (Mz), then y snicker-snacked z (Ryz).\n\nSo putting that together, the inner part is: for all y, if Ny \u2227 (\u2200z(Mz \u2192 Ryz)), then Rx snicker-snacks y. Wait, no. The structure is \"Every borogove snicker-snacked every borogove that...\". So for each x (a borogove), and for each y (a borogove that satisfies the condition), x snicker-snacks y.\n\nSo the full structure would be:\n\nFor all x, if Nx, then for all y, if (Ny and for all z, if Mz then Ryz), then Rx(y).\n\nWait, more accurately, the sentence says that every borogove (x) snicker-snacks every borogove (y) such that y snicker-snacked every tove. So the translation would involve two universal quantifiers: one for x and one for y. And the condition on y is that for all z, if z is a tove, then y snicker-snacked z.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2200y ( (Ny \u2227 \u2200z (Mz \u2192 Ryz)) \u2192 Rxy ) )\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. For every x, if x is a borogove, then for every y, if y is a borogove and for every z, if z is a tove then y snicker-snacked z, then x snicker-snacks y. Yes, that seems to capture the original sentence. The original says that every borogove (x) snicker-snacks every borogove (y) that meets the condition of having snicker-snacked every tove. So the formula should correctly represent that with the quantifiers and implications.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the abbreviations correctly. N is for borogove, M for tove, R for the snicker-snacked relation. The order in R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], so Rxy means x snicker-snacks y. Wait, no: R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], so Rxy would be x snicker-snacks y. Wait, the original sentence says that x (every borogove) snicker-snacked every y (borogove that...). So yes, Rxy is correct here.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u2200y( (Ny \u2227 \u2200z(Mz \u2192 Ryz)) \u2192 Rxy ) )\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check for any possible mistakes. Are there any parentheses issues? The innermost part is \u2200z(Mz \u2192 Ryz), which is correct for \"y snicker-snacked every tove.\" Then, the y must be a borogove (Ny) and satisfy that. Then, if that's true, then x snicker-snacks y. And this is for all x and y. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u2200y((Ny\u2227\u2200z(Mz\u2192Ryz))\u2192Rxy)))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"Only toves are mimsy and every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"[1] is a tove\", J for \"[1] is mimsy\", O for \"[1] is a rath\", R for \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\", and a for \"Zindle\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its two parts connected by \"and\". The first part is \"Only toves are mimsy\", and the second part is \"every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Only toves are mimsy.\" In logic, \"Only A are B\" usually translates to \"If something is B, then it is A.\" So here, if something is mimsy (Jx), then it must be a tove (Mx). So the first part would be \u2200x (Jx \u2192 Mx). That makes sense because it's saying that being a tove is a necessary condition for being mimsy.\n\nNow the second part: \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\" The abbreviation O is for \"[1] is a rath\", so \"every rath\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 ...). The action here is \"snicker-snacked Zindle\", which uses the R abbreviation. Since R is \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\", and the object here is Zindle (a), then for each rath x, Rxa would mean x snicker-snacked Zindle. So the second part is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxa).\n\nPutting both parts together with the conjunction \"and\", the entire formula should be the conjunction of the two universal statements. So combining them: \u2200x (Jx \u2192 Mx) \u2227 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxa). \n\nWait, but should I check if there's any possibility of using a single quantifier for both? Probably not, because the two parts are separate statements. The first is about mimsy things being toves, and the second about every rath doing something to Zindle. They don't share variables or dependencies, so keeping them as separate universals connected by \u2227 is correct.\n\nLet me double-check the \"Only toves are mimsy\" part. Another way to think about \"Only A are B\" is that the set of B is a subset of A. So indeed, for all x, if x is B then x is A. So Jx \u2192 Mx is correct. \n\nAnd for the second part, \"every rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" translates directly to for all x, if x is a rath (Ox), then Rxa. That seems right. \n\nSo the final formula is the conjunction of these two universal statements. No quantifier scope issues here. The variables are all bound correctly. I don't see any mistakes here.

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the sentence and understand its structure. The sentence is: \"If Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo, then Zindle will whiffle only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nAlright, breaking this down. The main structure is a conditional statement: If [A], then [B only if C]. Let's identify each part.\n\nFirst, the antecedent of the main conditional is \"Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\" Using the abbreviations provided, R is \"[1] snicker-snacked [2].\" Since the subject and object are both Bungo, which is represented by 'c', this would be \u00acR(c, c). Because it's \"didn't snicker-snack,\" we need to negate R applied to c and c.\n\nNow, the consequent is \"Zindle will whiffle only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\" The structure here is \"B only if C,\" which in logic translates to B \u2192 C. So, \"Zindle will whiffle\" is F(a) since F is \"[1] will whiffle\" and a is Zindle. The \"only if\" part requires that F(a) implies the other condition.\n\nThe other condition is \"every rath chortled at Bungo.\" The abbreviation for being a rath is O: \"[1] is a rath,\" and P is \"[1] chortled at [2].\" So, for every x, if O(x) (x is a rath), then P(x, c) (x chortled at Bungo). That would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, c)).\n\nPutting it all together: The entire sentence is \"If \u00acR(c, c), then (F(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, c)))\". In logical symbols, that's \u00acRcc \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)). Wait, but the variables need to be properly quantified. Let me check again.\n\nThe main conditional is \u00acR(c, c) \u2192 [F(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, c))]. Since all the predicates are properly applied with the constants and variables, I think that's correct. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any parts. The \"only if\" translates to the implication where the first part is the consequent. So \"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. Here, the consequent of the main \"if...then...\" is \"Zindle will whiffle only if...\", which becomes F(a) \u2192 ... So yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, check the abbreviations again to make sure I used them correctly. R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], so Rcc is Bungo snicker-snacked Bungo. The negation is correct. F is [1] will whiffle, applied to Zindle (a), so Fa. O is [1] is a rath, so Ox. P is [1] chortled at [2], so Pxc where x is a rath and c is Bungo. The universal quantifier over x for all raths. Yes.\n\nSo the final formula should be: \u00acRcc \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)). Let me write that with proper syntax. The quantifier should come before the implication. So \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, c)). And since the variables are in the right place, I can write it as \u00acRcc \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)). That's the structure. I think that's correct. Let me check if there are any parentheses issues. The main connective is the implication between \u00acRcc and the rest. The rest is Fa \u2192 \u2200x..., so parentheses around that. Yes. So the entire formula is well-formed.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc))",

The sentence to translate is: \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin is uffish.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"[1] is a rath,\" Q for \"[1] galumphed over [2],\" b for \"Rafin,\" and K for \"[1] is uffish.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The main structure is a conjunction of two parts: the first part is \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin,\" and the second part is \"it is not the case that Rafin is uffish.\" So the overall structure should be something like (Part1) \u2227 (Part2).\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin.\" In predicate logic, \"Not all A are B\" is typically translated as \u2203x(Ax \u2227 \u00acBx). Wait, actually, \"Not all A do P\" would be the negation of \"All A do P.\" The standard translation for \"All A do P\" is \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Px). Therefore, the negation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ax \u2192 Px), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Ax \u2227 \u00acPx). \n\nIn this case, \"All raths galumphed over Rafin\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb), since Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2],\" so the first argument is the subject, and the second is the object (Rafin, which is constant b). Therefore, \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb), or equivalently \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). \n\nNow the second part: \"It is not the case that Rafin is uffish.\" Since Rafin is represented by constant b, and K is \"[1] is uffish,\" this translates to \u00acKb. \n\nPutting them together with a conjunction: [\u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb)] \u2227 [\u00acKb]. Alternatively, since sometimes people prefer to use the existential form instead of the negation of a universal, but the problem allows either as long as it's well-formed. However, the example given uses the universal form (like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), so maybe it's better to stick with the negation of the universal here. \n\nSo the full formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u00acKb. \n\nWait, but the original sentence uses \"but\" which is just a conjunction in logic, so that's correct. \n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations. O is [1] is a rath, so Ox means x is a rath. Q is [1] galumphed over [2], so Qxb would be x galumphed over b (Rafin). The first part says not all raths did that. The second part is \u00acKb, since Kb would be \"Rafin is uffish,\" so the negation is correct. \n\nAnother way to think about \"Not all raths...\" is \"There exists a rath that did not galumph over Rafin,\" which is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). But both \u00ac\u2200x(...) and \u2203x(...) are equivalent here. However, the example uses the universal quantifier with negation in the implication. The example for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if we follow that structure, the negation would be \u00ac\u2200x(...), which is acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u00acKb. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the existential form, it could be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb) \u2227 \u00acKb. But which one is more appropriate here? The example uses the universal form for the positive statement, so the negation would use the negated universal. Since the user didn't specify which form to use, both are logically equivalent, but maybe the expected answer is using the negation of the universal. Let me check standard practice. Typically, \"Not all\" is directly the negation of the universal quantifier, so \u00ac\u2200x(...). So I think that's the way to go here. \n\nSo combining both parts with \u2227, the final formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u00acKb.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb)\u2227\u00acKb",

The first part is \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" The second part is \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't uffish.\" The conjunction here is \"but,\" which in logic usually translates to a conjunction (AND), even though it implies contrast, logically it's just \u2227.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" The phrase \"Not all\" typically translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. So \"All toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa), since M is [1] is a tove, R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], and a is Zindle. Therefore, \"Not all\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) because the negation of a universal becomes an existential with the negated implication. But I need to check which form is more appropriate here. The original statement is a direct negation of the universal, so maybe keeping it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) is better unless there's a reason to convert it. However, sometimes in logic, it's preferable to push the negation inward. Let me recall: \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP. So in this case, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00ac(Mx \u2192 Rxa)), which simplifies further to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) because \u00ac(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to A \u2227 \u00acB. So both forms are correct, but perhaps the existential form is more standard here. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given and standard syntax. The example given uses the universal form, so maybe the original negation is acceptable. But maybe the problem expects the equivalent existential. Let me think. The example for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" became \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). If the sentence were \"Not every linguist admires Charlie,\" that would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). But the example doesn't show that case. However, the user's instruction says to return a single well-formed formula in standard syntax. So perhaps either form is acceptable, but the most direct translation would be the negation of the universal. However, sometimes in logic, people prefer to avoid negations directly in front of quantifiers if possible, but I don't think that's a strict rule. So maybe I should present it as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa).\n\nThen the second part: \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't uffish.\" This is a double negation. \"It is not the case that [Rafin isn't uffish]\" translates to \u00ac(\u00acKb), since K is [1] is uffish and b is Rafin. The \"isn't\" is \u00acKb, and the outer negation is \u00ac(\u00acKb), which simplifies to Kb. So the entire second part simplifies to Kb. \n\nNow combining both parts with a conjunction. The original sentence uses \"but,\" which is logically equivalent to \"and,\" so we use \u2227. So the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 Kb. Alternatively, if we convert the first part to the existential, it would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2227 Kb. Which one is correct? Let me check the equivalence again. Since \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP, and here P is (Mx \u2192 Rxa), so \u00acP is \u00ac(Mx \u2192 Rxa) which is Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa. Therefore, both forms are equivalent. However, the example uses the universal form, so perhaps the problem expects the negation of the universal. But maybe the problem expects the simplest form. However, in the example, they used the universal directly. Let me check the exact wording of the original sentence: \"Not all toves...\" which is a direct negation of \"all,\" so translating \"all\" as \u2200 and then negating it. So perhaps the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 Kb. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the existential form. But given that the example for \"Every linguist...\" uses the universal, and the negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200..., perhaps that's acceptable. However, in formal logic, both forms are correct. The problem says to return a single well-formed formula, so either is acceptable. However, to stay as close as possible to the original sentence structure, using the negation of the universal might be better. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together: the first part is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa), the second is Kb. Combined with \u2227. So the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 Kb.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Let me re-express the entire sentence again. The first part is \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" The second part is \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't uffish.\" So the second part simplifies to \"Rafin is uffish,\" which is Kb. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is the conjunction of \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) and Kb. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the existential, \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2227 Kb. Both are equivalent. But perhaps the problem expects the first form. Let me check standard practice. In predicate logic, when translating \"Not all A are B,\" it's often rendered as \u00ac\u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Ax \u2227 \u00acBx). Either is acceptable, but perhaps the problem expects the direct translation without converting the quantifier. Since the example uses the universal for \"Every linguist,\" then \"Not every linguist\" would be \u00ac\u2200. So I think that's the way to go here. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 Kb.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2227 Kb",

I need to translate the sentence \"A rath chortled at a rath that chortled at a rath.\" using the abbreviations O and P. \n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The main structure is \"A rath chortled at [a rath that chortled at a rath].\" So there's a rath (let's say x) who chortled at another rath (y), and this y chortled at another rath (z). \n\nSo the sentence can be parsed as: There exists a rath x such that there exists a rath y where P(x, y) (x chortled at y), and there exists a rath z where P(y, z). Wait, but the original sentence says \"a rath that chortled at a rath\". So the \"that\" part is modifying the second rath. So y is a rath that chortled at z. So the structure is: There exists x, y, z such that O(x), O(y), O(z), P(x, y), and P(y, z). \n\nBut since the original sentence uses \"a rath\" each time, it's existential quantifiers for each. So the formalization would involve three existential quantifiers: \u2203x \u2203y \u2203z (O(x) \u2227 O(y) \u2227 O(z) \u2227 P(x,y) \u2227 P(y,z)). \n\nWait, but maybe the sentence is structured as \"There is a rath x such that x chortled at a rath y, and y chortled at a rath z.\" So that's three raths in a chain. So yes, three existentials. Each rath must satisfy O, and the two P relations. So the formula would be \u2203x \u2203y \u2203z (O(x) \u2227 O(y) \u2227 O(z) \u2227 P(x,y) \u2227 P(y,z)). \n\nI need to make sure that all the raths are properly quantified and that the relations are correctly applied. The original sentence uses \"a rath\" three times, so each is an existential. So the translation should have three \u2203 variables, each with O applied, and the P's connecting them.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. Let's start by identifying the main components and how they relate.\n\nThe sentence is: \"If Zindle will whiffle, then every rath is beamish only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\nFirst, the structure is a conditional. The antecedent is \"Zindle will whiffle,\" and the consequent is a more complex statement involving raths being beamish and toves galumphing over Bungo.\n\nUsing the abbreviations provided:\n- F(a) for \"Zindle will whiffle\" since F is [1] will whiffle and a is Zindle.\n- O(x) for \"[x] is a rath\"\n- L(x) for \"[x] is beamish\"\n- M(x) for \"[x] is a tove\"\n- Q(x, c) for \"[x] galumphed over Bungo\" where c is Bungo.\n\nThe consequent part says \"every rath is beamish only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So, if we have \"every rath is beamish only if [condition],\" that would mean that the condition is necessary for every rath being beamish. So the entire consequent would be: If every rath is beamish, then [the condition]. \n\nThe condition here is \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" \"All toves galumphed over Bungo\" would be \u2200x (M(x) \u2192 Q(x, c)). So \"not all toves...\" is \u00ac\u2200x (M(x) \u2192 Q(x, c)). Alternatively, this can be written as \u2203x (M(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x, c)) by moving the negation inside, but the problem might prefer to keep it as the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nPutting it all together: The main conditional is F(a) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (O(x) \u2192 L(x)) ) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (M(x) \u2192 Q(x, c)) ) ].\n\nWait, but the original structure is \"every rath is beamish only if [condition]\". So \"only if\" here is between the two parts. So the structure is: (Every rath is beamish) only if (not all toves...). Which translates to: (Every rath is beamish) \u2192 (not all toves...). \n\nTherefore, the consequent of the main conditional is \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 L(x)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (M(x) \u2192 Q(x, c)).\n\nSo the entire formula would be F(a) \u2192 [ \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 L(x)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (M(x) \u2192 Q(x, c)) ].\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if the parentheses are correct. The main implication is \"If F(a), then [consequent]\". The consequent is itself an implication between the rath being beamish and the negation of the toves galumphing. So the structure is:\n\nF(a) \u2192 ( \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 L(x)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (M(x) \u2192 Q(x, c)) )\n\nAlternatively, this can be written using the equivalence of implications. Remember that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem might expect the direct translation without rephrasing. So the correct formalization is as above.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other parts. The main connective is the implication from F(a) to the rest. The rest is another implication between the universal statement about raths and the negation of the universal statement about toves. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me write it out with proper symbols:\n\nF(a) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x, c)) )\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me verify each part again.\n\nOriginal sentence: If Zindle will whiffle [F(a)], then [every rath is beamish only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo].\n\n\"Every rath is beamish\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). The \"only if\" makes this the antecedent of an implication where the consequent is the negation of \"all toves galumphed over Bungo\".\n\nSo, the consequent of the main implication is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x, c)).\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is F(a) \u2192 [ \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x, c)) ].\n\nI don't see any errors here. The abbreviations are used correctly, and the structure follows the logical connectives as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nF(a)\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx)\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Q(x,c)))",

The sentence is \"Not all toves will whiffle or a rath is beamish.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is \"Not all toves will whiffle or a rath is beamish.\" There's a disjunction (OR) here between two parts: \"Not all toves will whiffle\" and \"a rath is beamish.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all toves will whiffle.\" In predicate logic, \"All A are B\" is usually translated as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)). So the negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)). But I remember that the negation of \"all\" can also be expressed as \"there exists at least one that is not.\" So \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx) is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). But the original sentence uses \"Not all...\", so maybe I should stick with the negation of the universal quantifier here. So the first part would be \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx).\n\nThen the second part: \"a rath is beamish.\" This seems like an existential statement. There exists at least one rath that is beamish. So \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). Because \"a rath\" implies existence, so we need an existential quantifier here.\n\nNow the original sentence combines these two parts with \"or\". So the entire formula should be the disjunction of these two parts. So putting it together: \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2228 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx).\n\nWait, but I need to check if there's any scope issues. The original sentence is \"Not all toves will whiffle or a rath is beamish.\" The \"or\" could be connecting the two clauses, so the entire statement is either \"Not all toves...\" or \"a rath...\". So the structure is (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx)) \u2228 (\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx)).\n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations. M is [1] is a tove, F is [1] will whiffle. So for the first part, all toves whiffle is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx), so not all is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx). For the second part, O is [1] is a rath, L is [1] is beamish. So \"a rath is beamish\" is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). \n\nYes, that seems right. So combining them with a disjunction, the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2228 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). \n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the correct logical symbols and that the quantifiers are properly scoped. Also, the example given uses arrows for implications and the quantifiers correctly. So I think this is the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)\u2228\u2203x(Ox\u2227Lx)",

So I need to translate this into predicate logic.\n\nFirst, the main thing here is that Bungo is both the subject and the object. Since P is a two-place predicate, it requires two arguments. The first argument is the one doing the chortling, and the second is the one being chortled at. So in this case, both are Bungo. \n\nThe sentence is negative, so we need to use the negation symbol \u00ac. In predicate logic, to say that something is not the case, we just put a \u00ac in front. \n\nSo the structure would be \u00acP(c, c). Because Bungo (c) did not chortle at Bungo (c). There's no quantifier here because it's a specific statement about Bungo, not a general one like \"all linguists\" or \"there exists someone\". \n\nWait, the example given used a universal quantifier, but this case is different. The example was about every linguist, but here it's a specific individual, Bungo. So no need for \u2200 or \u2203. Just a simple negation of the predicate applied to the same individual twice.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization should be \u00acPcc. That's using the standard syntax where the predicate is followed by its terms. No quantifiers needed here. Let me double-check. The sentence is \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\" So yes, the subject and object are both Bungo. So the correct formula is the negation of P with both arguments as c. Yep, that's \u00acPcc. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\n\u00acPcc",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The sentence is \"A rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.\" And the abbreviations are O for \"is a rath\" and R for \"snicker-snacked.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. It's a bit tricky because of the recursive structure. Let me break it down. The main structure is \"A rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.\" So there's a subject rath, which snicker-snacked another rath. But that other rath also snicker-snacked the first one (since \"it\" refers back to the first rath). \n\nSo, maybe there are two raths involved. Let's call them x and y. The first part is \"A rath (x) snicker-snacked a rath (y)\", so Rxy. Then the relative clause says \"that (y) snicker-snacked it (x)\", so Ryx. So both Rxy and Ryx must be true. Also, both x and y have to be raths, so Ox and Oy. \n\nBut the sentence starts with \"A rath...\", which is an existential quantifier, right? Because it's saying there exists at least one rath that did this. Similarly, \"a rath that...\" would also be an existential, but since they are connected, maybe we need two existentials? Wait, but in English, \"A rath snicker-snacked a rath...\" implies there exists an x and a y such that... So the formalization would be \u2203x \u2203y (Ox \u2227 Oy \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx). \n\nWait, but does the original sentence require that they are different raths? The sentence says \"a rath snicker-snacked a rath...\" which could be the same or different. However, the relative clause \"that snicker-snacked it\" implies that the second rath is different from the first because \"it\" refers to the first. So x and y are distinct. But the problem is, do we need to include that they are distinct? The original sentence doesn't explicitly say \"another rath,\" but the structure suggests that \"it\" refers back to the first rath. So the two raths are different. \n\nBut in predicate logic, unless we have a way to express distinctness, we can't assume variables are different. So maybe we need to include x \u2260 y? But the problem says to use only the given abbreviations, and there's no symbol for inequality. Hmm. The user didn't mention anything about equality or inequality, so maybe we can't include that. Therefore, the formalization would just be \u2203x \u2203y (Ox \u2227 Oy \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx). \n\nWait, but if x and y could be the same, then this would allow for a rath that snicker-snacks itself and is snicker-snacked by itself. But the original sentence says \"a rath that snicker-snacked it,\" where \"it\" refers to the first rath. So if they were the same, \"it\" would refer to itself, which might not make sense. But since we can't express distinctness, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore that and just go with the logical structure. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u2203x \u2203y (Ox \u2227 Oy \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx). Let me check again. The sentence is saying there exists a rath x and a rath y such that x snicker-snacked y and y snicker-snacked x. Yes, that seems to capture the mutual snicker-snacking between two raths. Since the abbreviations are O and R, and we need to use existential quantifiers for \"a rath,\" this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x\u2203y(Ox \u2227 Oy \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If Bungo is beamish, then [not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if every rath galumphed over Rafin].\" So the overall form is Lc \u2192 [ ... ].\n\nNow, the tricky part is the part after the conditional. The phrase \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" The \"only if\" here is important. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the \"A\" is \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo,\" and \"B\" is \"every rath galumphed over Rafin.\"\n\nSo let's parse that. Let me denote:\n\nLet A = \"Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" In predicate logic, \"Not all M galumphed over c\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQx c).\n\nThen B = \"Every rath galumphed over b.\" That's \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qy b).\n\nSo the \"A only if B\" becomes A \u2192 B. Therefore, the entire part after the main conditional is (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc)) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qy b).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is Lc \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc)) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qy b) ].\n\nWait, but I need to check if I got the \"only if\" direction right. Remember that \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the original says \"not all toves... only if every rath...\", then yes, it's A \u2192 B where A is the \"not all...\" part and B is the \"every rath...\" part.\n\nSo the main conditional is Lc (Bungo is beamish) leading to that implication. So the entire formula should be:\n\nLc \u2192 ( (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc)) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qy b) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can write it as Lc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qy b)).\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the abbreviations again to make sure I used the right symbols. The abbreviations are:\n\nL: [1] is beamish \u2192 Lc is \"Bungo is beamish\" since c is Bungo.\n\nM: [1] is a tove \u2192 Mx for x being a tove.\n\nQ: [1] galumphed over [2] \u2192 Qx c means x galumphed over Bungo (c), and Qy b is y galumphed over Rafin (b).\n\nO: [1] is a rath \u2192 Oy.\n\nYes, that all lines up. So the final formula should be as above. Let me also check if there are any quantifier scope issues. The variables x and y are bound by their respective quantifiers, so that's okay. The structure is correct.\n</think>\n\nLc\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc)\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192Qyb))",

So the sentence is: \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\" And we need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The first part is \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.\" The abbreviations given are R for \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\" and a for Zindle. So, since both the subject and object are Zindle (which is a), this would translate to \u00acRaa. Because R takes two arguments, both being a here, and we negate it because of the \"didn't.\"\n\nThen there's the second part: \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\" The abbreviation for chortled at is P, and Bungo is c. So the inner part is \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo,\" which would be \u00acPcc. But since it's \"it is not the case that...\" we need to negate that entire thing, making it \u00ac\u00acPcc. Wait, but double negation cancels out, so this simplifies to Pcc. However, maybe we should keep it as \u00ac\u00acPcc for accuracy unless instructed otherwise. But in logic, \u00ac\u00acP is equivalent to P, so either way is correct. But since the original sentence structure has a double negative, perhaps we should represent it as \u00ac\u00acPcc. But maybe the problem expects us to simplify it. Hmm. Let me check the example given. In the example, they directly used Rxc for \"admires Charlie.\" They didn't simplify any negations. So maybe we should keep the double negation as per the original sentence structure. Wait, the original says \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle...\" So \"it is not the case that [X]\" is \u00acX, where X is \"Bungo didn't chortle...\", which is \u00acPcc. So the entire second part is \u00ac(\u00acPcc), which is \u00ac\u00acPcc. But in logic, that's equivalent to Pcc, but maybe we need to represent it exactly as per the sentence. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Since the abbreviations for P is \"[1] chortled at [2]\", then the correct formalization for \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" is \u00acPcc. Then the negation of that is \u00ac\u00acPcc. However, perhaps the problem expects us to simplify the double negation. But the example didn't simplify anything; they just translated directly. For example, if the sentence was \"John didn't run,\" using R for \"runs,\" it would be \u00acRa. So here, following that logic, the second part should be \u00ac\u00acPcc. But maybe the problem expects us to simplify it to Pcc. Hmm. Let me think. The example uses a direct translation. The original sentence says \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle...\" which is a double negative. So the correct translation would be \u00ac(\u00acPcc) which is \u00ac\u00acPcc. However, in formal logic, we can write it as Pcc because they are equivalent. But the problem says to return a well-formed formula. So maybe we can simplify it. Wait, the example uses a direct translation. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" Translated to \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). They didn't simplify anything. So perhaps we need to follow the structure of the original sentence. So the original sentence's second part is a negation of a negation. Therefore, we should write \u00ac\u00acPcc. But let me check. If the sentence was \"It is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle...\", then the correct formalization would be \u00ac(\u00acPcc), which is equivalent to Pcc. But maybe the problem expects us to write it as \u00ac\u00acPcc. However, in formal logic, both are correct, but perhaps the problem expects simplification. But the example didn't simplify. For example, if the sentence was \"John did not not run,\" then the translation would be \u00ac\u00acRa. But maybe the problem expects that. However, since the original sentence has a double negative, perhaps we should represent it as such. But maybe the user wants the simplified version. Hmm. Let me see. The problem says \"return a single well-formed formula in standard predicate logic syntax.\" Since \u00ac\u00acPcc is equivalent to Pcc, but the problem may prefer the simplified version. However, the example didn't simplify. For example, if the sentence was \"John didn't run,\" it would be \u00acRa. But if the sentence was \"It is not true that John didn't run,\" then it would be \u00ac\u00acRa. So maybe we should follow that. Therefore, the second part is \u00ac\u00acPcc.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire sentence is the conjunction of the first part and the second part. The original sentence uses \"but,\" which in logic is equivalent to \"and,\" so we can use \u2227. Therefore, the entire formula would be \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc. Alternatively, if we simplify the double negation, it would be \u00acRaa \u2227 Pcc. But again, the example didn't simplify. Let me check the example again. The example's sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" The formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). There's no simplification there. So perhaps we need to follow the exact structure. Therefore, the second part is \u00ac\u00acPcc. So the formula is \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\" So \"it is not the case that [X]\" is \u00acX. Here, X is \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo,\" which is \u00acPcc. Therefore, the entire second part is \u00ac(\u00acPcc) which is \u00ac\u00acPcc. So the correct formalization is \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc. However, in logic, this is equivalent to \u00acRaa \u2227 Pcc. But the problem might accept either. However, the example uses direct translation. Let me think again. The example uses implication directly. So perhaps we need to follow the exact wording. So the answer should be \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects us to simplify the double negation. The user didn't specify whether to simplify or not. But since the example didn't have any negations, it's hard to tell. However, in formal logic, both are correct. But perhaps the problem expects the simplified version. Let me check the abbreviations again. The abbreviations for P is \"[1] chortled at [2]\". The sentence says \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" is \u00acPcc. Then \"it is not the case that...\" is \u00ac(\u00acPcc) which is \u00ac\u00acPcc. But maybe the problem expects that. However, in formal logic, the double negation is redundant and can be simplified. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations don't mention anything about simplification. So perhaps we need to represent exactly as per the sentence structure. Therefore, the answer is \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the simplified version. But I'm not sure. Let me think. If the problem had said \"Bungo chortled at Bungo,\" then it would be Pcc. But here, the sentence is a double negative. So maybe the correct formalization is \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc. However, in logic, the double negation is equivalent to Pcc. But since the problem says to use the abbreviations and not to add any explanations, perhaps we should present it as \u00acRaa \u2227 Pcc. Because the original sentence is a double negative, which is equivalent to an affirmation. But maybe the problem wants to test understanding of negation. Hmm. Let me check the example again. The example had a simple negation in the antecedent. So perhaps the problem expects us to translate exactly. So if the sentence is \"Z didn't R Z\" that's \u00acRaa. Then \"it is not the case that B didn't P B\" is \u00ac(\u00acPcc). Therefore, the entire formula is \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc. Therefore, the answer is \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc. However, maybe the problem expects the simplified version. But since the user didn't specify, but the example didn't simplify, I think we should follow the exact structure. Therefore, the final formula is \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc. But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes in logic, double negation is considered redundant and simplified. However, the problem might want the direct translation. Let's go with that.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPcc",

The sentence is \"Zindle isn't mimsy and every rath gyred.\" The abbreviations provided are J for \"is mimsy\", a for Zindle, O for \"is a rath\", and H for \"gyred\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"Zindle isn't mimsy\". Since J is the predicate for being mimsy, and a is Zindle, this part should translate to \u00acJa. That's straightforward.\n\nThe second part is \"every rath gyred\". This seems like a universal quantification. The structure here is \"All raths gyred\". Using the abbreviations, O is \"is a rath\" and H is \"gyred\". So for every x, if Ox (x is a rath), then Hx (x gyred). That would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Hx). \n\nNow, combining the two parts with a conjunction. The original sentence uses \"and\", so we need to connect \u00acJa and \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Hx) with \u2227. \n\nPutting it all together, the formalization should be \u00acJa \u2227 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Hx). Let me double-check the abbreviations to make sure I didn't mix up any symbols. J is for mimsy, a is Zindle, so \u00acJa is correct. O is for being a rath, H for gyred, so the universal statement is right. The conjunction is appropriate here since the original sentence has \"and\". \n\nI don't see any other elements in the sentence that need to be captured.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to translate is: \"If Zindle gimbled, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If Zindle gimbled, then...\" So the antecedent is \"Zindle gimbled,\" which translates to Ia using the abbreviation I for \"[1] gimbled\" and a for Zindle.\n\nThe consequent is a bit more complex: \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\" The phrase \"only if\" usually introduces a necessary condition. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the existence of a borogove that snicker-snacked Rafin (let's call this part A) is only if (so implies) that every rath snicker-snacked Bungo (part B). \n\nBreaking down part A: \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\" The word \"a\" suggests an existential quantifier. So there exists some x such that x is a borogove (N x) and x snicker-snacked Rafin (R x b). So that's \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb).\n\nPart B is \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\" \"Every\" translates to a universal quantifier. So for all y, if y is a rath (O y), then y snicker-snacked Bungo (R y c). So that's \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ryc).\n\nPutting the consequent together: The existence of the borogove implies the universal statement about raths. So (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ryc)).\n\nNow, combining the antecedent and the consequent with the conditional: Ia \u2192 [ (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ryc)) ].\n\nWait, but in logic, when you have a conditional as the consequent, you can sometimes rephrase it. However, here the structure is straightforward. The main connective is the implication from Ia to the entire \"only if\" structure.\n\nSo the entire formula should be:\n\nIa \u2192 ( \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ryc) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, the order of quantifiers and parentheses matters. Let me check if there's any scope issues. The existential quantifier \u2203x is only over Nx \u2227 Rxb, and the universal quantifier \u2200y is over Oy \u2192 Ryc. That seems correct.\n\nSo putting it all together with the given abbreviations:\n\nI: [1] gimbled (so Ia is Zindle gimbled)\nN: [1] is a borogove\nR: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\nb: Rafin\nO: [1] is a rath\nc: Bungo\n\nYes, that's all accounted for. So the final formula is:\n\nIa \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Ryc))\n\nI need to make sure there are no free variables. The quantifiers \u2203x and \u2200y are properly scoped within the implication. The variables x and y are bound, so the formula is closed. \n\nAnother thing to check: the use of parentheses. Since the consequent is a material implication, the parentheses are necessary to group the existential and universal parts correctly. Without them, the formula might be misinterpreted, but with proper parentheses, it's clear.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nIa \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Ryc))\n</think>\n\nIa\u2192(\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192Ryc))",

The sentence is \"A rath is uffish and Rafin isn't a tove.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The first part is \"A rath is uffish.\" The abbreviations given are O for [1] is a rath and K for [1] is uffish. So, \"A rath is uffish\" would probably be an existential statement. Because \"A rath\" implies there exists at least one rath that is uffish. So that would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Kx). Wait, or maybe it's a universal? Hmm. But \"A rath\" isn't saying all raths, just that there's at least one. So existential quantifier makes sense here.\n\nThen the second part is \"Rafin isn't a tove.\" The abbreviation for Rafin is b, and M is [1] is a tove. So that would be \u00acMb. Because Rafin (b) is not a tove, so we negate M with b as the argument.\n\nNow, combining the two parts with a conjunction. The original sentence uses \"and,\" so we need to connect the two statements with \u2227. So the entire formula would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Kx) \u2227 \u00acMb. \n\nWait, let me check if there's any other way to interpret \"A rath is uffish.\" Could it be a universal? Like \"All raths are uffish\"? But the wording is \"A rath,\" which in English usually implies existence, not universality. For example, \"A dog has four legs\" would typically be translated as \u2200x (Dogx \u2192 FourLegsx), but here the article is different. Wait, actually, in English, \"A rath is uffish\" might be ambiguous? But given the example provided earlier in the instructions: \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" was translated with a universal. So here, since it's \"A rath,\" maybe it's existential. So I think \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Kx) is correct for the first part.\n\nSo combining both parts, the entire formula is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Kx) \u2227 \u00acMb. Let me check the syntax again. The quantifier is correctly placed, and the conjunction is between the two statements. Yes, that seems right. No variables are free here. The second part is about Rafin, so no quantifier needed there. Alright, that should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox\u2227Kx)\u2227\u00acMb",

It has two parts connected by \"and\": \"Rafin isn't a tove\" and \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\" So I'll need to handle both parts and combine them with a logical conjunction (since \"and\" translates to \u2227).\n\nLooking at the abbreviations provided:\n- M: [1] is a tove. So \"Rafin is a tove\" would be Mb. But the sentence says \"Rafin isn't a tove,\" so that's the negation of Mb. So \u00acMb.\n\nThen the second part: \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\" The abbreviation P is [1] chortled at [2]. So \"Rafin chortled at Bungo\" would be Pbc (since b is Rafin and c is Bungo). But since it's negated, it's \u00acPbc.\n\nPutting it all together, the two negated parts are connected by \u2227. So the entire formula should be \u00acMb \u2227 \u00acPbc.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The original sentence uses \"and\" between the two clauses, so yes, conjunction. And each part is correctly negated. The abbreviations for Rafin is b, Bungo is c. So yes, Pbc would be \"Rafin (b) chortled at Bungo (c)\", and negating that. Similarly, M is for being a tove, so Mb is Rafin being a tove, negated. So combining them with \u2227 gives the correct translation. I think that's all.

The key part here is understanding the negation and the scope of the quantifiers. The sentence says that there are no borogoves that galumphed over every rath. In other words, for all borogoves, it's not the case that they galumphed over every rath. Alternatively, it could also mean that for every rath, there isn't a borogove that galumphed over all of them. Wait, I need to be careful here.\n\nThe original sentence structure is \"No X did Y over every Z.\" In logic terms, this usually translates to a universal quantifier with a negation. Let me think. \"No X\" can be expressed as \"For all X, not...\" So the first part is \"For all x, if x is a borogove, then it is not the case that x galumphed over every rath.\"\n\nBreaking it down further, \"galumphed over every rath\" would mean that for every rath y, x galumphed over y. So the inner part is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy). Wait, no. Wait, Oy is \"[y] is a rath.\" So if we have \"every rath,\" we need to say that for all y, if y is a rath, then x galumphed over y. But actually, maybe the Q is already defined as \"[1] galumphed over [2],\" so if we have \"x galumphed over every rath,\" that would be \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy). But the original statement is \"No borogoves galumphed over every rath,\" meaning that there is no borogove x such that for all raths y, x galumphed over y. Alternatively, the negation of \"there exists a borogove that galumphed over every rath.\"\n\nWait, maybe I should consider two interpretations. The sentence could be read in two ways: either \"No borogove galumphed over every rath\" (i.e., for all borogoves x, it is not the case that x galumphed over every rath), or \"For every rath, there is no borogove that galumphed over it,\" but that seems different. Wait, no. The original sentence is \"No borogoves galumphed over every rath.\" So the correct interpretation is that there does not exist a borogove that galumphed over every rath. So that would be \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nBut let me check. If the sentence was \"Every borogove did not galumph over every rath,\" that would be different. But \"No borogoves...\" is stronger. It's saying that there are zero borogoves that have the property of galumphing over every rath. So the correct formalization would be the negation of the existence of such a borogove. \n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n- There exists a borogove x such that for every y, if y is a rath, then x galumphed over y. That's \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)).\n\nThe original sentence says that this does not exist, so the negation of that: \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)).\n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence between \u00ac\u2203 and \u2200\u00ac, this can be rewritten as \u2200x (\u00ac(Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy))). Which can be further simplified using De Morgan's law to \u2200x (\u00acNx \u2228 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). But maybe it's better to keep it as the negation of the existential. However, in formal logic, it's often preferable to push the negation inward if needed, but the problem says to use standard syntax. The example given uses a universal quantifier with an implication. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is formalized as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So they use a universal quantifier with an implication. So perhaps for the current problem, the best approach is to express the negation of the existence as a universal quantifier with a negated conjunction.\n\nBut let's see. The original statement is \"No borogoves galumphed over every rath.\" So another way to phrase it is \"For all borogoves x, x did not galumph over every rath.\" Which would translate to \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nAlternatively, the negation of \"x galumphed over every rath\" is \"there exists a rath that x did not galumph over.\" So \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy) is equivalent to \u2203y (Oy \u2227 \u00acQxy). Therefore, the entire formula could be written as \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 \u00acQxy)). \n\nBut which one is correct? Let me think. The original statement is saying that there's no borogove that galumphed over every rath. So the two formalizations are equivalent:\n\n\u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)) is equivalent to \u2200x (\u00acNx \u2228 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)), which is equivalent to \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)), which in turn is equivalent to \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 \u00acQxy)). \n\nSo both forms are correct, but which one should be used here? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations are N, O, Q. So perhaps the answer can be written either way. But the example uses the implication form. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So when translating a universal statement, they use the implication. \n\nIn this case, if we take the approach of \"For all borogoves, they did not galumph over every rath,\" then it's \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). But maybe the problem expects the negation to be pushed in, so that it's in terms of existence of a rath that wasn't galumphed over. \n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether to push the negation in or not. However, in formal logic, both forms are acceptable. However, the example uses the implication form. Let me see. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they didn't convert the implication into a disjunction. So perhaps here, the expected answer is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). But maybe the problem expects to have the negation expressed in terms of existential quantifier. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be written as \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). However, in the example, they didn't use a negation of an existential, but rather a universal. So which is correct? The original sentence is \"No borogoves...\", which is a universal negative. In traditional logic, \"No S are P\" is translated as \u2200x (Sx \u2192 \u00acPx). But here, the P is a more complex statement. \n\nWait, in this case, the structure is \"No S do Q over every T.\" So perhaps the correct way is to express that for all S, it's not the case that they Q every T. Which would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nAlternatively, the other approach is to say that there does not exist an S that Qs every T. Which is \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nWhich one is more appropriate here? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Both approaches are valid. However, the example given uses a universal quantifier with an implication. Let me think about the example again. The example sentence is \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" which is a universal affirmative, translated as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). Similarly, \"No borogoves...\" is a universal negative. In predicate logic, \"No S are P\" can be translated as \u2200x (Sx \u2192 \u00acPx). But here, the P is not a simple predicate but a statement involving another quantifier. \n\nSo if we follow the same pattern as the example, perhaps the answer should be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). However, another way is to use the negation of an existential. But which one is considered standard? \n\nIn the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is a universal statement where the predicate is Rxc. Here, in our problem, the predicate is \"galumphed over every rath,\" which is itself a universal statement. So \"No borogoves (galumphed over every rath)\" would be equivalent to \"For all borogoves, it is not the case that they galumphed over every rath,\" which is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"galumphed over every rath\" is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy), then \"No borogoves did that\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nBut both are logically equivalent. However, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Depending on how the problem expects it. Since the example uses the universal quantifier with implication, perhaps the expected answer is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). However, in some logical systems, it's preferable to avoid nested quantifiers in the consequent if possible, but that's not really an issue here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in the form that directly negates the existential. Let me check. The example uses a universal, but maybe here, since the original sentence is a negation of an existential, it's better to write it as such. \n\nWait, the original sentence is \"No borogoves galumphed over every rath.\" This can be rephrased as \"It is not the case that there exists a borogove that galumphed over every rath.\" So that would be \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nThis seems like a direct translation. However, the example uses a universal quantifier. But the example is a universal affirmative, while this is a universal negative with a complex predicate. \n\nSo, perhaps both answers are correct, but the problem may expect one or the other. Let me think about the abbreviations. The abbreviations given are N: [1] is a borogove, O: [1] is a rath, Q: [1] galumphed over [2]. \n\nIn the first approach, using \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)), we have:\n\n- For all x, if x is a borogove, then it is not the case that for all y, if y is a rath, then x galumphed over y.\n\nIn the second approach, using \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)), we have:\n\n- It is not the case that there exists an x such that x is a borogove and for all y, if y is a rath, then x galumphed over y.\n\nBoth are correct. Which one is preferred? The example uses a universal quantifier, but the example is a positive statement. However, the problem here is a negative statement. \n\nIn standard predicate logic, both forms are acceptable. However, the problem may prefer the form that uses the universal quantifier with the implication, similar to the example. \n\nBut perhaps the answer is supposed to be in the form of \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). Let me check the example again. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). But the example chose the universal form. So perhaps here, the answer should also use the universal form. \n\nTherefore, following the example's pattern, the answer would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nBut to confirm, let's think about the meaning. \"No borogoves galumphed over every rath\" means that for every borogove, there is at least one rath that they did not galumph over. Which is equivalent to \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 \u00acQxy)). \n\nBut that's another equivalent form. However, the problem may not require pushing the negation all the way in. The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, and the example uses implications. \n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the negation to be expressed as a negation of an existential, then \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)) would be acceptable. \n\nBut which one is more standard? In logic textbooks, both are considered correct. However, the example given uses the universal quantifier with implication. Therefore, to be consistent with the example, perhaps the answer should follow the same pattern. \n\nThus, the final answer would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nBut let me check once more. The original sentence is \"No borogoves galumphed over every rath.\" The negation of \"there exists a borogove that galumphed over every rath\" is indeed the correct translation. However, depending on how you structure it, you can have either form. \n\nThe example uses a universal statement for \"Every linguist...\", so perhaps the problem expects the same approach here. Therefore, using a universal quantifier with the negation inside. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nAlternatively, if we want to write it with the existential quantifier, it would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 \u00acQxy)). But the problem may prefer to keep the negation as it is, without converting the universal to existential. \n\nGiven that the example uses implication and not converting to existential, I think the answer should be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qxy)). \n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(Oy\u2192Qxy))",

The sentence is: \"Every tove snicker-snacked Rafin just in case not all toves gimbled.\" The abbreviations given are M for being a tove, R for snicker-snacked with a second argument, b is Rafin, and I for gimbled.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The phrase \"just in case\" is a bit tricky. I remember that in logic, \"just in case\" usually translates to a biconditional (\u2194), but I need to be careful here. Let me think. The structure is \"Every tove snicker-snacked Rafin [just in case] not all toves gimbled.\" So the entire statement is saying that the first part (every tove snicker-snacking Rafin) is true exactly when the second part (not all toves gimbled) is true. So it's a biconditional between two statements.\n\nLet me break it down. The left side of the biconditional is \"Every tove snicker-snacked Rafin.\" Using the abbreviations, that would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb). Because for every x, if x is a tove (Mx), then x snicker-snacks b (Rafin).\n\nThe right side is \"not all toves gimbled.\" The negation of \"all toves gimbled.\" \"All toves gimbled\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Ix). The negation of that is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). Because \"not all\" is equivalent to \"there exists at least one that doesn't.\"\n\nSo putting them together with the biconditional, the entire formula should be:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb) \u2194 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acIx)\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original sentence says \"Every tove snicker-snacked Rafin just in case not all toves gimbled.\" So the biconditional is between the universal statement and the existential statement. That seems right. \n\nIs there any other part I might have missed? The \"just in case\" is often used to mean \"if and only if,\" so yes, biconditional. The rest of the abbreviations seem to fit. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. The sentence structure is \"A just in case B,\" which I think translates to A \u2194 B. For example, \"I will go just in case it's sunny\" would mean \"I go if and only if it's sunny.\" So here, \"Every tove snicker-snacked Rafin\" if and only if \"not all toves gimbled.\" So yes, the biconditional between the universal and the negated universal (existential).\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxb) \u2194 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). Let me check the symbols again. Quantifiers are \u2200 and \u2203, connectives are \u2192, \u2227, etc. Yes, that looks correct. No need for parentheses around the biconditional unless necessary, but since both sides are well-formed formulas, the parentheses around each part is correct.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this logic problem. So the sentence is a bit complex: \"If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then not all toves will whiffle only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\" Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall the abbreviations given. P is [1] chortled at [2], so Pab would mean Zindle chortled at Rafin. The sentence starts with \"If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin...\" which translates to \u00acPab. \n\nThen, the consequence is \"not all toves will whiffle only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\" The structure here is a bit tricky. The phrase \"only if\" in logic usually sets up a conditional where the statement before \"only if\" is the consequent. So \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the main clause is \"not all toves will whiffle only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\" Let me parse that.\n\nLet me rephrase the consequence part: \"Not all toves will whiffle\" is the antecedent? Or is it the consequent? Wait, the structure is \"Not all toves will whiffle only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\" So \"Not all toves will whiffle\" (let's call this A) only if \"every rath chortled at Bungo\" (call this B). So A only if B translates to A \u2192 B. Therefore, the consequence is (\u00ac\u2200Mx Fx) \u2192 \u2200Oy Pyc. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, \"Not all toves will whiffle\" is equivalent to \"There exists a tove that will not whiffle.\" So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). But maybe it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) for the translation here. So the consequence part is: If not all toves will whiffle, then every rath chortled at Bungo. So the implication is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u00acPab, then [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc)]. So the main connective is a conditional where the antecedent is \u00acPab, and the consequent is that implication.\n\nWait, but in logic, \"If A then (B \u2192 C)\" is equivalent to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Which can also be written as A \u2227 B \u2192 C. But maybe we need to keep it as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Let me confirm. The original sentence is \"If Z didn't chortle at R, then [not all T will whiffle only if every rath chortled at B].\" So the structure is: \u00acPab \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc) ]\n\nBut in formal logic, implications can be nested. So that's acceptable. However, sometimes people prefer to avoid nested conditionals if possible, but I think here it's necessary. \n\nLet me check if there's another way. The phrase \"only if\" in the consequence part is key. The original is saying that \"Not all toves will whiffle\" can only happen if \"every rath chortled at Bungo.\" So the implication is that if \"not all toves will whiffle,\" then it must be that \"every rath chortled at Bungo.\" So yes, the implication is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00acPab \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Py c))\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can also write implications with arrows. Now, let's check the variables. The variables x and y are used here; since they are bound by quantifiers, it's okay. Also, need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly scoped. \n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations. For P, the first argument is the chortler, the second is the chortlee. So \"every rath chortled at Bungo\" is \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Py c), since c is Bungo. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization should be:\n\n\u00acPab \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Pyc))\n\nBut wait, in logic, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. Maybe that's a more standard way to write it. Let me consider whether the problem expects that form. The example given in the problem uses a straightforward implication. For example, the example was \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So perhaps we can leave it as nested implications. \n\nAlternatively, converting the consequent implication into a conjunction. The original consequent is (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc)). Which is equivalent to \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)) \u2228 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc), which simplifies to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2228 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc). But that's not helpful here. \n\nBut the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so nested implications are allowed. Therefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u00acPab \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Pyc))\n\nNow, let's check for any possible errors. The main connective is the implication starting with \u00acPab. The consequent is another implication. The variables x and y are used in different quantifiers, so no conflict. The abbreviations are all used correctly. \n\nI think that's it. Let me write that in the required format.\n</think>\n\n\u00acPab \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Pyc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"No toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, the abbreviations are: M for \"[1] is a tove\", R for \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\", and b for \"Rafin\". So the task is to express that there are no toves who have snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nIn English, \"No X do Y\" can be translated in a couple of ways. One common approach is to use a universal quantifier with a negation. For example, \"No X are Y\" becomes \u2200x (Xx \u2192 \u00acYx). But here, it's about actions: no toves performed the action of snicker-snacking on Rafin.\n\nSo, the structure would be: For all x, if x is a tove, then it is not the case that x snicker-snacked Rafin. That would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acRxb). \n\nAlternatively, another way to express \"No X do Y\" is to say that there does not exist an x such that x is an X and x does Y. So that would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxb). \n\nWhich one is correct? Both are logically equivalent. Since the example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier with implication (like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), maybe the expected answer here is the universal form. But I need to check which is more appropriate here.\n\nThe original sentence is \"No toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" So, it's saying that there's no instance where a tove snicker-snacked Rafin. The existential form with negation would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxb), which directly states that there are no such x. The universal form \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acRxb) says that for any x, if it's a tove, then it didn't do that action. Both are equivalent because of the equivalence between \u00ac\u2203 and \u2200\u00ac in predicate logic.\n\nBut the example given uses the universal quantifier approach. For instance, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the original sentence was \"No linguist admires Charlie,\" that would be \u2200x(Lx\u2192\u00acRxc) or \u00ac\u2203x(Lx \u2227 Rxc). However, since the example uses the universal form, maybe the problem expects the same here. \n\nSo applying that pattern here, \"No toves snicker-snacked Rafin\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acRxb). \n\nBut let me make sure. The example's sentence is a universal affirmative, and the translation uses a universal quantifier. The current problem is a universal negative, so similarly, using the universal quantifier with implication and negation would be the way to go. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acRxb). Alternatively, the negation of the existential might also be acceptable, but given the example, the universal form is probably expected. \n\nSo the final answer is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acRxb).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acRxb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"A borogove snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked a rath.\" using the given abbreviations. The abbreviations are N for is a borogove, O for is a rath, and R for snicker-snacked. \n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The main structure is that there's a borogove (so N applies to some entity) that snicker-snacked a rath. But then there's a relative clause: \"that snicker-snacked a rath.\" So the first rath is the one that did the snicker-snacking of another rath.\n\nSo let me think. The first part is \"A borogove snicker-snacked a rath...\" which suggests an existential quantifier for the borogove and the first rath. Then, the rath in question also snicker-snacked another rath. So there's a chain here: borogove R rath1, and rath1 R rath2.\n\nIn predicate logic, since we're dealing with existence, I should use existential quantifiers. Let me outline the variables. Let's say there exists an x (the borogove), a y (the first rath), and a z (the second rath). \n\nSo, N(x) for x being a borogove, O(y) for y being a rath, O(z) for z being a rath. Then R(x,y) because the borogove snicker-snacked the first rath. And R(y,z) because that first rath snicker-snacked the second rath.\n\nSo putting it all together, it would be \u2203x \u2203y \u2203z (N(x) \u2227 O(y) \u2227 O(z) \u2227 R(x,y) \u2227 R(y,z)). Wait, but maybe we don't need three variables. Wait, the original sentence says \"a borogove snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked a rath.\" The \"that\" refers back to the first rath. So it's one borogove, one first rath (which is the subject of the relative clause doing the snicker-snacking), and another second rath. So yes, three entities. \n\nBut maybe I can reduce variables. For example, the first rath (y) must be a rath and snicker-snack another rath (z). So the structure is there exists a borogove x, there exists a rath y such that R(x,y), and there exists a rath z such that R(y,z). So combining these, we need to have all three existentials. \n\nSo the formula would be \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z (N(x) \u2227 O(y) \u2227 O(z) \u2227 R(x,y) \u2227 R(y,z)). \n\nWait, but maybe the second rath (z) could be the same as y? But no, because the sentence says \"a rath that snicker-snacked a rath.\" The \"a rath\" implies another one. So z is different? Well, in predicate logic, unless we have identity, we can't specify they are different. But since the problem doesn't mention anything about distinctness, we can just assume that they could be the same or different. The sentence just says \"a rath that snicker-snacked a rath.\" So the minimal translation would just require existence. \n\nSo the formula is as above. Let me check the abbreviations again. N is [1] is a borogove, O is [1] is a rath, R is [1] snicker-snacked [2]. So yes, R(x,y) is correct for x snicker-snacked y. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is three existential quantifiers with the conjunction of N(x), O(y), O(z), R(x,y), R(y,z). So the answer should be \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(Nx \u2227 Oy \u2227 Oz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz). \n\nI need to make sure that I'm not missing any parts. The original sentence is \"A borogove... a rath that... a rath.\" The relative clause \"that snicker-snacked a rath\" modifies the first rath. So the first rath must be the one doing the snicker-snacking. So yes, the structure is correct. \n\nI think that's it. So the final formula is \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(Nx \u2227 Oy \u2227 Oz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz).\n</think>\n\n\u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(Nx \u2227 Oy \u2227 Oz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz)",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the sentence says: \"If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\"\n\nLet me parse the structure. The main part is a conditional statement: If P, then Q. Where P is \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" and Q is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\"\n\nStarting with P: \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\" Using the abbreviations, N is [1] is a borogove, R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], and b is Rafin. So, there exists some x that is a borogove (Nx) and Rxf (where x is the subject and b is the object). Wait, but the sentence says \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin,\" which would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). Because there's at least one borogove that did that action to Rafin.\n\nNow the consequent Q: \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is that if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then it's the case that not all toves galumphed over Zindle. Wait, let me check again. The original is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves...\" So the structure is: \u00acR(b,b) only if \u00ac\u2200t (Mt \u2192 Q(t,a)). \n\nSo \"only if\" turns into an implication where the antecedent is the left side and the consequent is the right. Wait, no. Wait, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So in this case, the \"A\" is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin\", which is \u00acR(b,b). The \"B\" is \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle\", which is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)). So putting that together, the \"only if\" becomes \u00acR(b,b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)).\n\nBut then the entire original sentence is: If P (there's a borogove that snicker-snacked Rafin), then this implication (\u00acR(b,b) \u2192 ...). So the whole formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 [\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa)]\n\nWait, but variables need to be properly quantified. Let me check the variables. In the consequent, the \"not all toves...\" would be \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Q(y,a)), perhaps. But the variable name doesn't matter as long as it's consistent. However, in the initial part, we have x as a variable for borogove. But in the consequent, when we have \u2200x, that's okay because variables can be reused as long as they're bound. However, to avoid confusion, maybe use a different variable for the toves. For example, in the consequent, it's \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Q(y,a)). But since the problem doesn't specify variable names, just use x again. Wait, but in the consequent, if we have \u2200x, that's okay. Let me just write it as \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa))\n\nBut wait, the antecedent of the main conditional is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), and the consequent is (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa)). \n\nBut let me check if I have the \"only if\" part correct. The original sentence says \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves...\". So that's \u00acRbb only if \u00ac\u2200... which is equivalent to \u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200... So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, another thing to check is whether the \"not all toves\" is correctly translated. \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is equivalent to \"There exists a tove that did not galumph over Zindle\", which is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). However, the user might want the direct translation of \"not all\" as \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa). Both are equivalent, but since the problem says to use the given abbreviations, and the abbreviation for galumphed over is Q, so the correct way is to use \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is:\n\n(\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes people prefer to have the quantifiers at the front. But here, since the implication is part of the consequent, it's okay. Also, note that the variables in the existential and universal quantifiers are both x. However, in the consequent, the x in \u2200x is a different variable from the x in the antecedent. Wait, but in the main formula, after the initial \u2203x, the consequent has another \u2200x. That's allowed in logic because the scope of each quantifier is limited to their own subformulas. So the x in the existential is bound in the antecedent, and the x in the universal in the consequent is bound in its own scope. So that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, perhaps use a different variable for the universal quantifier in the consequent. For example, \u2200y (My \u2192 Qya). But since the problem doesn't specify variable names beyond the abbreviations, and the example uses x, I think it's acceptable to use x again. The example uses x in \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), so the same variable can be reused in different scopes.\n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa))\n\nBut I need to check if there's any issue with the order of the implications. Let me re-express the entire thing:\n\nIf (there exists a borogove that snicker-snacked Rafin), then (if Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle).\n\nYes, that's the structure. So the main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. The consequent is itself an implication between \u00acRbb and the negation of the universal statement.\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be as above. Now, let me check the abbreviations again:\n\n- N: [1] is a borogove\n- R: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\n- b: Rafin\n- M: [1] is a tove\n- Q: [1] galumphed over [2]\n- a: Zindle\n\nYes, so Rbb is Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.

I need to translate the sentence \"Bungo snicker-snacked a borogove.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's look at the abbreviations provided. N stands for \"[1] is a borogove\", R is \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\", and c is \"Bungo\". \n\nThe original sentence is about Bungo performing the action of snicker-snacking on a borogove. So, the structure is Subject (Bungo) + Verb (snicker-snacked) + Object (a borogove). In predicate logic terms, this would involve a two-place predicate for the action R, where the first argument is the subject and the second is the object. \n\nSince Bungo is the subject, that would be represented by c (since c is \"Bungo\"). The object here is a borogove, which is a noun that needs to be a borogove. But wait, the sentence says \"a borogove\", which implies existence. So, there exists some entity that is a borogove, and Bungo snicker-snacked it. \n\nSo breaking it down: There exists an x such that x is a borogove (N applies to x) and R applies to c (Bungo) and x. Therefore, the formula should be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 R(c, x)). \n\nWait, the abbreviations for R are [1] snicker-snacked [2], so R's first argument is the snicker-snacker, which is Bungo (c), and the second is the borogove (x). So Rcx. \n\nPutting it all together: \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rcx). \n\nI need to make sure I'm using the correct quantifier and connectives. Since the original sentence asserts that Bungo did this to a (some) borogove, it's an existential quantifier. The connective should be conjunction because both conditions must hold: x is a borogove and the action happened. \n\nYes, that makes sense.

The sentence to translate is \"Bungo and Zindle gyred.\" The abbreviations given are H: [1] gyred, c: Bungo, and a: Zindle.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is asserting. It says that both Bungo and Zindle performed the action of gyring. Since \"gyred\" is the past tense of \"gyre,\" the verb here. The abbreviation H is for \"[1] gyred,\" so H applied to an individual would mean that individual gyred.\n\nNow, since there are two subjects, Bungo and Zindle, I need to represent both of them gyred. In predicate logic, when we have two individuals both satisfying a predicate, we can use the conjunction connective (\u2227). \n\nThe names Bungo and Zindle are represented by the constants c and a, respectively. So, applying H to c would be Hc (Bungo gyred), and Ha would be Zindle gyred. The sentence is stating both of these facts together. \n\nTherefore, the formalization should be Hc \u2227 Ha. There's no need for quantifiers here because we're dealing with specific individuals, not making a general statement about all or some members of a category. \n\nLet me double-check. The original sentence doesn't use any quantifiers like \"all\" or \"some,\" just two specific names. So, using the constants directly with the predicate and combining them with \u2227 makes sense. \n\nI don't see any other logical connectives needed here.

Also, the abbreviations are correctly applied: H is a one-place predicate, and c and a are constants. \n\nSo the final formula should be Hc \u2227 Ha.\n</think>\n\nHc \u2227 Ha",

There exists something that is a rath and is uffish. In predicate logic, existential quantification uses \u2203. So, this would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Kx). Wait, but sometimes when we say \"a rath,\" we might mean there's exactly one, but the problem doesn't specify uniqueness. Since it's just \"a rath,\" the existential quantifier with the conjunction should suffice.\n\nNow the second part: \"Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\" This is a universal statement. For all x, if x is a borogove, then x chortled at Zindle. Using the universal quantifier \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxa). Since Zindle is represented by 'a', the second argument of P is 'a'.\n\nPutting them together with the conjunction \"and,\" the entire formula would be the conjunction of the two parts.

The first existential quantifier uses x, and the universal quantifier also uses x. But since they are in different scopes, it's okay to reuse the same variable. However, sometimes it's clearer to use different variables, but the problem doesn't require that. The standard practice allows reusing variables as long as they are bound in different scopes. So the formula should be correct as written.\n\nLet me double-check. The first part says there exists some x that's a rath and uffish. The second part says for all x, if x is a borogove, then x chortled at a. Yes, that's correct. The variables are bound separately, so no conflict.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the sentence is: \"If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nLet me parse this. The main structure is a conditional (\"If A, then B\"). The antecedent is \"not all toves chortled at Bungo,\" and the consequent is a bit more complicated: \"Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all toves chortled at Bungo.\" In predicate logic, \"all toves chortled at Bungo\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)), where Mx is \"x is a tove,\" P is \"chortled at,\" and c is Bungo. So \"not all\" would be the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x, c)), but I think the original form is better here to keep it straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is saying that if Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo, then every borogove chortled at Bungo. Wait, no\u2014actually, the structure is \"Bungo didn't sn... only if every borogove...\" So the \"A only if B\" structure applies here. Let me rephrase: The entire consequent is \"\u00acR(c, c) only if \u2200y(Ny \u2192 P(y, c))\". So translating \"A only if B\" as A \u2192 B, this becomes \u00acR(c, c) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 P(y, c)).\n\nPutting it all together, the whole sentence is: If \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)), then (\u00acR(c, c) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 P(y, c))).\n\nSo combining these, the formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)) \u2192 (\u00acR(c, c) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 P(y, c)))\n\nBut I should check if there are any equivalences or simplifications. However, the problem says to use the given abbreviations and return a well-formed formula. Also, I need to make sure variables are properly quantified. The antecedent uses x, and the consequent uses y, which is fine as they are different variables. \n\nAnother thing to note: The consequent is an implication where the antecedent is \u00acR(c, c) and the consequent is \u2200y(Ny \u2192 P(y, c)). So the entire implication is \u00acR(c,c) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 P(y,c)). \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)) \u2192 (\u00acR(c, c) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 P(y, c)))\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again. The original sentence: If [not all toves chortled at Bungo], then [Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo]. Yes, the translation seems to capture that structure. The \"only if\" is correctly translated as an implication from the first part (Bungo didn't snicker-snack) to the second (every borogove...). \n\nI don't see any errors here. So the final formula is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c))\u2192(\u00acR(c,c)\u2192\u2200y(Ny\u2192P(y,c)))",

The sentence is: \"Every rath gimbled unless a rath galumphed over Zindle.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is \"Every rath gimbled unless a rath galumphed over Zindle.\" The word \"unless\" here is crucial. In logic, \"A unless B\" can be translated as \"If not B, then A\" or \"A \u2228 B\". But I need to be careful with the quantifiers here.\n\nThe first part is \"Every rath gimbled.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a rath\" and I is \"[1] gimbled.\" So, for all x, if O(x) then I(x). That would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). But there's the \"unless\" part.\n\nThe second part is \"a rath galumphed over Zindle.\" The abbreviation Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", and a is Zindle. So, there exists some y such that O(y) (since it's a rath) and Q(y, a). So \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya).\n\nNow, putting \"unless\" together. The sentence says that every rath gimbled unless there's a rath that galumphed over Zindle. So, if it's not the case that a rath galumphed over Zindle, then every rath gimbled. Alternatively, either every rath gimbled or there exists a rath that galumphed over Zindle.\n\nBut which is the correct way to handle \"unless\"? Let's recall that \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". However, in this case, A is \"Every rath gimbled\" and B is \"There exists a rath that galumphed over Zindle.\"\n\nSo, using the \"\u00acB \u2192 A\" approach: If it's not the case that there exists a rath that galumphed over Zindle, then every rath gimbled. That would be \u00ac(\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya)) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). Alternatively, using \"A \u2228 B\": \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya).\n\nBut which one is more appropriate here? The original sentence is a universal statement with an exception. However, the \"unless\" here applies to the entire universal statement. Let me think again. The structure is \"Every X does Y unless there is a Z does W.\"\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the universal statement holds unless the exception occurs. So, if the exception doesn't occur, then the universal holds. That would be \u00ac(\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya)) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). Alternatively, we can express it as \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). However, in logic, these two are equivalent because (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2228 B). So, \u00ac(\u2203y...) \u2192 \u2200x... is equivalent to \u00ac\u00ac\u2203y... \u2228 \u2200x..., which simplifies to \u2203y... \u2228 \u2200x.... Wait, no. Wait, A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. So if we have \u00acB \u2192 A, that's equivalent to \u00ac(\u00acB) \u2228 A, which is B \u2228 A. So \"A unless B\" is A \u2228 B. Therefore, in this case, the entire \"Every rath gimbled\" is A, and B is \"a rath galumphed over Zindle\". So the translation would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check with an example. Suppose \"You will pass unless you don't study.\" That would translate to \"You will pass \u2228 you don't study.\" Which is equivalent to \"If you study, then you will pass.\" So in this case, the original sentence is \"Every rath gimbled unless a rath galumphed over Zindle.\" So translating \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B. Therefore, the formula would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). \n\nBut I need to make sure that the quantifiers are correctly placed. The universal quantifier in \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) is part of the A in A \u2228 B. So the entire formula is a disjunction between the universal statement and the existence statement. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a different interpretation where the \"unless\" applies per rath? Like, for each rath, it gimbled unless there exists a rath that galumphed over Zindle. But that would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Ix \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya))). But that would mean that for each rath x, either x gimbled or there's a rath that galumphed over Zindle. However, the original sentence is about all raths gimbling unless there's at least one rath that did something. So if there is such a rath, then maybe some raths didn't gimble. But the original sentence says \"Every rath gimbled unless...\" So if the exception occurs (there is a rath that galumphed), then it's not necessarily that all raths gimble. Therefore, the correct translation is that either all raths gimble, or there exists a rath that galumphed. Therefore, the formula is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). \n\nAlternatively, if we use material implication, the \"unless\" can be represented as \u00acB \u2192 A, where A is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) and B is \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). So \u00ac(\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya)) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). Both forms are equivalent. Which one is preferable? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so either is acceptable. But perhaps the first approach (A \u2228 B) is simpler here. \n\nBut let me check if there's any ambiguity. The original sentence is a universal statement with an exception. The \"unless\" here is a global condition: if the exception doesn't hold, then the universal holds. So the correct translation would be \u00acB \u2192 A. Which is equivalent to A \u2228 B. \n\nIn terms of formal syntax, both are correct. However, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Let me think if there's any reason to prefer one over the other. The example given in the problem uses implication for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So perhaps using implication is more standard here. But the \"unless\" requires combining two statements. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct way is to think of it as \"For all raths x, if there does not exist a rath that galumphed over Zindle, then x gimbled.\" Which would be \u2200x(\u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya) \u2192 (Ox \u2192 Ix)). But that seems different. Let's parse that. If there's no such y, then for any x, if x is a rath, then x gimbled. Which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203y... \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). Which is the same as before. \n\nSo the formula would be \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). Alternatively, \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). Both are equivalent. Which one is preferable? The problem's example uses implication, so maybe using implication is better here. But the example is a simple universal statement without an \"unless\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to represent the \"unless\" as a disjunction. Since \"A unless B\" is A \u2228 B. So in this case, the A is \"Every rath gimbled\", which is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix), and B is \"a rath galumphed over Zindle\", which is \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). Therefore, the formula is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). \n\nBut I need to check if that's logically correct. Let's take a simple case. Suppose the sentence is \"You pass unless you don't study.\" Let P be \"You pass\", S be \"You study.\" Then \"P unless \u00acS\" would be P \u2228 \u00acS, which is equivalent to S \u2192 P. But in our case, the \"unless\" is between two statements, one of which is a universal and the other an existential. \n\nSo in our case, the original sentence is \"Every rath gimbled unless a rath galumphed over Zindle.\" Translating \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B. Therefore, the formula would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). \n\nBut I need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly scoped. The disjunction is between the universal statement and the existential statement. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a case where both are true? For example, all raths gimble and some rath galumphed. In that case, the disjunction is still true. Which aligns with the original sentence. The original sentence says that if the exception (a rath galumphed) occurs, then the universal may not hold. But if the exception occurs, then the disjunction is true regardless of the universal. If the exception doesn't occur, then the universal must hold. So the disjunction captures that. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). \n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose the sentence was \"Every rath gimbled if no rath galumphed over Zindle.\" Then that would be \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). Which is equivalent to the disjunction. \n\nSo both forms are correct, but the problem might expect one or the other. The example uses implication, but that's for a straightforward universal. Since the user didn't specify which form to use for \"unless\", but in logic, both are acceptable. However, in formal logic, it's common to translate \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer should be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). \n\nBut let me verify once more. Let's take an example where the exception holds. Suppose there exists a rath that galumphed over Zindle. Then the disjunction is true because the second part is true. If there is no such rath, then the first part (the universal) must be true. Which is exactly what the original sentence says. \n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the correct formalization is the disjunction of the universal statement and the existence statement.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix)\u2228\u2203y(Oy\u2227Qya)",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is: \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"is a rath\", L for \"is beamish\", M for \"is a tove\", and G for \"will burble\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The key parts here are \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble.\" The word \"unless\" usually translates into a logical implication. In English, \"A unless B\" can be thought of as \"If not B, then A\", or equivalently, \"A \u2228 B\". But I need to be careful with the quantifiers here.\n\nThe main subject is \"A rath is beamish\". So, this seems like a universal statement. Like \"All raths are beamish...\" but modified by the \"unless\" clause. So maybe it's saying that for all x, if x is a rath, then x is beamish unless every tove will burble. Wait, but how does the \"unless\" interact with the quantifiers?\n\nLet me break it down. The original structure is \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble.\" So, if it's not the case that every tove will burble, then a rath is beamish. Alternatively, if every tove will burble, then maybe the rath isn't beamish? Or is it the other way around?\n\nThe \"unless\" can be tricky. Let's recall that \"P unless Q\" is logically equivalent to \"P \u2228 Q\" and also to \"\u00acQ \u2192 P\". So, applying that here: \"A rath is beamish\" (P) unless \"every tove will burble\" (Q). So that would translate to \"For all x, if x is a rath, then (Lx \u2228 Q)\", where Q is \"\u2200y(My \u2192 Gy)\" because \"every tove will burble\" is a universal statement.\n\nWait, but the original sentence is about a rath being beamish. So maybe it's a universal statement over all raths. So the structure is: For all x, if x is a rath, then (Lx unless \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy)). Using the \"unless\" translation, that becomes: For all x, (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy)))? Or is it that the entire \"unless\" applies to the entire implication?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's structured as: If it is not the case that every tove will burble, then every rath is beamish. Which would be \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). But the original sentence is phrased as \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble,\" which might be more directly translated as for any rath, it is beamish unless (the condition about toves). So perhaps for each rath, Lx holds unless \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy). So that would be Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy)). Then, since the original says \"A rath is...\", we need to universalize over x: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy))).\n\nBut another way to think about \"unless\" is that it's an exception. So \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble\" could mean that if every tove will burble, then the rath is not beamish. Wait, but that would be the contrapositive. Let me check:\n\n\"P unless Q\" is equivalent to \"if not Q, then P\". So if we take Q as \"every tove will burble\", then \"A rath is beamish unless Q\" would be equivalent to \"If not Q, then A rath is beamish.\" So translating \"if not Q then for all raths, they are beamish.\" So \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut the original sentence is phrased as \"A rath is beamish unless...\", which could be read as a statement about each individual rath. So maybe for each rath x, Lx holds unless \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy). Which would be Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy)). \n\nBut which one is correct? Let me think. If the original sentence is \"Every rath is beamish unless every tove will burble,\" then perhaps the \"unless\" applies to the entire universal statement. But the wording is \"A rath is beamish unless...\" which is similar to \"All raths are beamish unless...\", so maybe it's equivalent to \"If it's not the case that every tove will burble, then all raths are beamish.\" So that would be \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut the problem is that the user's example uses a universal quantifier for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So in this case, the structure is similar. The original sentence here is about a rath being beamish with a condition. \n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble\" can be rephrased as \"Either every tove will burble or every rath is beamish.\" Wait, but that might not be accurate. Because \"A rath is beamish unless...\" might not necessarily mean that all raths are beamish. Wait, but \"A rath is beamish...\" is a general statement. If we take \"A rath is beamish\" as \"All raths are beamish\", then the \"unless\" would modify that. So the sentence would be equivalent to \"All raths are beamish unless every tove will burble.\" Which would be similar to \"If it is not the case that every tove will burble, then all raths are beamish.\" Which would be \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut another interpretation could be that for each individual rath, it's beamish unless (the condition). So for each x, if x is a rath, then either Lx is true or every tove will burble. So \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy))). \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? Let's take an example. Suppose there is one tove that doesn't burble. Then, according to the first interpretation (\u00ac\u2200y... \u2192 ...), since not every tove burbles, all raths are beamish. According to the second interpretation, each rath is beamish because the \"unless\" condition is not met. Both interpretations would lead to the same result here. \n\nBut what if every tove does burble? Then in the first case, the antecedent is false, so the implication is true regardless. In the second case, for each rath, the \"unless\" condition is true (every tove will burble), so the disjunction is true regardless of whether the rath is beamish. So in that case, the formula would be true even if some raths are not beamish. But the original sentence says \"A rath is beamish unless...\" So if the condition (every tove will burble) is true, then the rath doesn't have to be beamish. So in that case, the rath may or may not be beamish. But the original sentence is phrased as \"A rath is beamish unless...\", which suggests that when the condition holds, the rath may not be beamish. \n\nBut if we take the first approach (\u00ac\u2200y... \u2192 \u2200x...), then when the condition holds (every tove burbles), the implication is vacuously true regardless of the raths. But the original sentence doesn't say anything about what happens when the condition holds. However, if we take the second approach (for each rath, Lx \u2228 \u2200y...), then when the condition holds, each rath's formula is true regardless of Lx, meaning that the rath can be non-beamish. \n\nSo perhaps the correct translation is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy))). \n\nBut let's check the example given. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So when the sentence is a universal statement about all raths, we use a universal quantifier. The original sentence here is similar in structure to \"Every rath is beamish unless...\", so maybe it's structured as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 Q)), where Q is \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"unless\" applies to the entire universal statement. For example, \"All raths are beamish unless all toves burble\" could be translated as (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2228 (\u2200y (My \u2192 Gy))). But that would be a disjunction between two statements. However, the original sentence is not structured as a disjunction but as a conditional. \n\nWait, but \"unless\" is a conditional. So the correct way is to model it as a conditional. The structure is: If not Q, then P, where P is \"All raths are beamish\" and Q is \"All toves will burble\". So that would be \u00acQ \u2192 P. Which would be \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut which is the correct way? Let's think about the difference between the two approaches. \n\nSuppose there are two raths and one tove. \n\nCase 1: The tove does not burble. Then, according to the first approach (\u00acQ \u2192 \u2200x...), since \u00acQ is true, we require all raths to be beamish. According to the second approach (for each rath, Lx \u2228 Q), since Q is false, each rath must be beamish. Both agree here. \n\nCase 2: The tove does burble. Then Q is true. The first approach has the implication being \u00acQ \u2192 ... which is vacuously true, so nothing is required about the raths. The second approach requires for each rath, Lx \u2228 Q is true, which is true because Q is true, so regardless of Lx. So in this case, the raths can be beamish or not. \n\nBut the original sentence says \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble.\" So when every tove does burble, the \"unless\" condition is met, so the rath doesn't have to be beamish. Which matches both approaches. \n\nBut what if there's a scenario where some toves burble and others don't? Let's say Q is false (since not every tove burbles). Then according to both approaches, all raths must be beamish. \n\nBut the problem is whether the original sentence is making a universal statement about raths (so that all must be beamish if the condition isn't met) or if it's a statement about each individual rath. The wording \"A rath is beamish...\" is a bit ambiguous. In English, \"A rath is beamish...\" usually means \"All raths are beamish...\", so it's a universal statement. Therefore, the correct translation would be to take the entire universal statement and apply the \"unless\" to it. \n\nSo translating \"All raths are beamish unless all toves will burble.\" Which would be: If it is not the case that all toves will burble, then all raths are beamish. Which is \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut how to express this in predicate logic? Let's check the example again. The example had a universal statement translated with \u2200x (Lx \u2192 ...). So if we follow that, then the translation would involve an implication with the antecedent being the negation of the tove condition and the consequent being the universal statement about raths. \n\nBut in predicate logic, we can't have implications at the top level unless we are using some form of conditional. However, in formal logic, we can express this as a material implication. \n\nSo the formula would be: \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut the problem is that the user's example uses a universal quantifier with an implication. However, in this case, the entire statement is an implication between two quantified formulas. \n\nBut the user's instructions say to return a single well-formed formula in standard predicate logic syntax. So this would be acceptable. \n\nBut wait, the example's formalization was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is a universal quantifier. In this case, the formula would be an implication between two statements. \n\nBut perhaps there's another way. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble.\" Which can be rephrased as \"Either every tove will burble or every rath is beamish.\" Because \"P unless Q\" is equivalent to \"P or Q\". But here, P is \"A rath is beamish\" which is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). And Q is \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy). So the entire formula would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy). \n\nBut is that correct? Let me check. If \"P unless Q\" is P \u2228 Q, then yes. But does that hold? For example, if \"It will rain unless the ground is dry\" would translate to \"It will rain \u2228 the ground is dry.\" But in logic, that would mean that either it rains or the ground is dry. However, in natural language, \"unless\" can sometimes imply exclusivity, but in logic, it's just inclusive. \n\nSo if we take \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble\" as \"Either all raths are beamish or all toves will burble\", then the formalization would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy). \n\nBut this is different from the implication approach. Which one is correct? \n\nLet me think of a case where one is true and the other isn't. Suppose some toves burble and some don't. Then \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) is false. Also, suppose some raths are beamish and some aren't. Then \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) is false. So the disjunction would be false. But the implication approach would be \u00ac(false) \u2192 (false), which is true \u2192 false, which is false. So in this case, both the disjunction and the implication would be false. \n\nAnother case: suppose \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) is true (all toves burble), and \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) is false (some rath is not beamish). Then the disjunction is true \u2228 false = true. The implication is \u00actrue \u2192 false, which is false \u2192 false, which is true. So both are true. \n\nAnother case: suppose \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) is false (some tove doesn't burble), and \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) is true (all raths are beamish). Then disjunction is true \u2228 false = true. Implication is \u00acfalse \u2192 true, which is true \u2192 true, true. \n\nAnother case: suppose \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy) is false, and \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) is false. Then disjunction is false \u2228 false = false. Implication is \u00acfalse \u2192 false, which is true \u2192 false, which is false. \n\nSo in all cases, the disjunction and the implication have the same truth value. Therefore, they are logically equivalent. So both formalizations are equivalent. \n\nSo which one should we choose? The example given by the user uses a universal quantifier with an implication. The original sentence here is a bit more complex. However, since the example uses a universal quantifier, perhaps the expected answer here is to use the disjunction approach, which would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy). \n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"A rath is beamish unless every tove will burble.\" If we take \"A rath is beamish\" as \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx), then the disjunction is correct. But another way is to think that for each rath, it is beamish unless the condition holds. Which would lead to \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy))). \n\nBut this third approach is different. Let's see. Suppose there are two raths. If the condition (every tove will burble) is false, then for each rath, Lx must be true. So \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx), which is the same as the previous approaches. If the condition is true, then for each rath, the disjunction is true regardless of Lx. So this approach is equivalent to the disjunction approach. Because \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 Q)) is equivalent to (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2228 Q, assuming Q is a statement with no free variables. Wait, is that true?\n\nLet me check. Suppose Q is a statement that doesn't involve x. Then \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 (B(x) \u2228 Q)) is equivalent to (\u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x))) \u2228 Q. \n\nYes, because if Q is true, then the entire implication is true for all x. If Q is false, then \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)) must be true for the whole to be true. Therefore, the two are equivalent. \n\nSo the three approaches are equivalent. Therefore, the formalization can be written in different ways. However, the example uses a universal quantifier with an implication, so perhaps the expected answer here is to use the \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 ...)) form. \n\nAlternatively, since the example uses a universal quantifier and the main connective is an implication, perhaps the expected answer is to use the implication between two universal statements. \n\nBut the problem is that the example is simpler. The example's sentence is a universal statement without any \"unless\". The current sentence has an \"unless\" which complicates things. \n\nThe user's example uses \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So the structure is \u2200x (predicate \u2192 ...). For the current problem, if we follow the same pattern, perhaps we should have a universal quantifier where the antecedent is Ox and the consequent includes the \"unless\" condition. \n\nBut how to include the \"unless\"? If we take the approach that for each rath x, Lx holds unless \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy), then it's Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy)). So the entire formula is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy))). \n\nThis seems plausible. Let's check if this is equivalent to the other forms. As discussed earlier, this is equivalent to \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy). \n\nSince the user's example uses a universal quantifier with an implication, perhaps this is the way to go. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy))). \n\nLet me write this out using the abbreviations. \n\nO is [1] is a rath, so Ox means x is a rath. Lx is [1] is beamish. M is [1] is a tove, so My is y is a tove. G is [1] will burble, so Gy is y will burble. \n\nThe universal quantifier for y would be \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy), which captures \"every tove will burble.\" \n\nPutting it all together: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y(My \u2192 Gy))). \n\nThis should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Lx\u2228\u2200y(My\u2192Gy)))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is: \"If Rafin is beamish, then no borogoves are beamish only if no toves gimbled.\" The abbreviations given are L for beamish, b for Rafin, N for borogove, M for tove, and I for gimbled. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If Rafin is beamish, then [some statement]. The [some statement] part is \"no borogoves are beamish only if no toves gimbled.\" \n\nBreaking it down further. The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is saying that the fact that no borogoves are beamish holds only if no toves gimbled. So, if we let A be \"no borogoves are beamish\" and B be \"no toves gimbled\", then \"A only if B\" would be A \u2192 B. \n\nNow, let's formalize each part. Starting with the main conditional: If Rafin is beamish (Lb), then (\u2192) the rest. \n\nSo the main structure is Lb \u2192 (A \u2192 B), where A is \"no borogoves are beamish\" and B is \"no toves gimbled.\"\n\nNow, \"no borogoves are beamish\" translates to \"for all x, if N(x) then not L(x)\". In symbols: \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). \n\nSimilarly, \"no toves gimbled\" would be \"for all x, if M(x) then not I(x)\": \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). \n\nPutting that together, the \"only if\" part becomes (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx)). \n\nSo the entire formula is Lb \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx)) ].\n\nWait, but I need to check if there's any variable conflict. The x in the first universal quantifier and the x in the second are separate, but since they're both bound by their own quantifiers, it's okay to reuse x. Alternatively, I could use different variables, but since the problem allows using standard syntax and doesn't specify variable names, using x in both is acceptable. \n\nLet me make sure I didn't mix up the direction of the implication. The original says \"no borogoves are beamish only if no toves gimbled.\" So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Therefore, if A is true, then B must be true. So the implication is correct. \n\nSo putting it all together: The entire formula is Lb \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) ). \n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes people prefer to have the quantifiers at the front. Let me check if there's a way to simplify or rephrase. \n\nAlternatively, the inner implication is between two universal statements. But that's okay. The structure is correct. \n\nSo the final formula should be: Lb \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx)) )\n\nBut maybe I can write it with parentheses properly. Also, note that in predicate logic, the scope of quantifiers is important. Each \u2200x applies to its respective implication. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be:\n\nLb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nI need to make sure I didn't make any mistakes with the abbreviations. Let me check again:\n\n- \"Rafin is beamish\" is Lb, correct.\n- \"no borogoves are beamish\" is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx), correct.\n- \"no toves gimbled\" is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx), correct.\n\nYes.

The sentence is: \"Every tove galumphed over every rath that galumphed over every rath.\" The abbreviations are M for \"is a tove\", O for \"is a rath\", and Q for \"galumphed over\".\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The main structure seems to be \"Every tove galumphed over every rath that [something].\" The \"that\" part is \"galumphed over every rath.\" So the rath in question must be one that galumphed over every rath. \n\nSo breaking it down: For every tove (Mx), and for every rath (Oy) that satisfies the condition that y galumphed over every rath (so for all raths Oz, Qyz), then the tove x galumphed over that rath y. \n\nWait, the original sentence is \"Every tove galumphed over every rath that galumphed over every rath.\" So the structure is: For all x, if x is a tove, then for all y, if y is a rath and y galumphed over every rath, then x galumphed over y. \n\nLet me check that. The \"that\" clause modifies \"rath\", so \"every rath that [condition]\" becomes the y such that Oy \u2227 (for all z, if Oz then Qyz). So the main formula would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u2200y( (Oy \u2227 \u2200z(Oz \u2192 Qyz)) \u2192 Qxy )).\n\nBut maybe I need to structure the quantifiers properly. Let's see:\n\nStart with \"Every tove...\" which translates to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ...). Then, \"galumphed over every rath that...\" which would be \u2200y (if y is a rath that satisfies the condition, then Qxy). The condition for y is that it galumphed over every rath. So that condition is \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Qyz). Therefore, putting it together, the inner part for y is Oy \u2227 \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Qyz). \n\nSo the entire formula would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ( (Oy \u2227 \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Qyz)) \u2192 Qxy )).\n\nLet me check if I got the order right. The original sentence says every tove galumphed over every such rath. So for every x (tove) and every y (rath meeting the condition), Qxy holds. So yes, the quantifiers would be \u2200x and \u2200y inside. \n\nI need to make sure that I'm not missing any parts. The sentence is a bit recursive because the rath that galumphed over every rath includes itself? Like, y has to galumph over all raths, including itself. That's part of the condition. \n\nSo the formalization seems correct. Let me write it out with the symbols:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ( (Oy \u2227 \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Qyz)) \u2192 Qxy ))\n\nI think that's it. Let me check if the parentheses are balanced. The inner part is \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Qyz), then that's part of the antecedent in (Oy \u2227 ... ) \u2192 Qxy. Then the whole thing is inside the implication for x being a tove. Yes, looks balanced. \n\nI don't see any other abbreviations to use. The answer should use M, O, Q as given, and the quantifiers and connectives as specified. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2227\u2200z(Oz\u2192Qyz)\u2192Qxy))",

The phrase says that there exists a rath (so an entity that is a rath) which is also uffish. So, this would be an existential quantification. There exists some x such that Ox (x is a rath) and Kx (x is uffish). So that part would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Kx).\n\nNow, combining the two parts with the conjunction \"and.\" In logical terms, that's a \u2227 between the two statements. So the entire formula would be \u00acRca \u2227 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Kx).\n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations to make sure I didn't mix up any symbols. R is the snicker-snacked relation, c is Bungo, a is Zindle, O is being a rath, and K is being uffish. Yes, that seems right. Also, the sentence structure uses \"a rath is uffish,\" which implies there's at least one rath that is uffish, hence the existential quantifier. The first part is a straightforward negation of a two-place predicate. So putting it all together, the formalization should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRca \u2227 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Kx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Rafin is a tove only if not all toves will whiffle.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break it down into parts. The main structure is a conditional statement: If [A], then [B]. \n\nLet's identify A and B. \n\nA is \"not all toves chortled at Bungo.\" In predicate logic, \"all toves chortled at Bungo\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc), since M is [1] is a tove, and P is [1] chortled at [2], with c being Bungo. So \"not all\" would be the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc) because the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential with the negated implication. But maybe I should stick with the negation as given unless I need to convert it. The problem says to use the abbreviations provided, so I can keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nThen, the consequent is \"Rafin is a tove only if not all toves will whiffle.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, \"Rafin is a tove\" (which is Mb, since b is Rafin and M is being a tove) only if \"not all toves will whiffle.\" So that would be Mb \u2192 [not all toves will whiffle].\n\nNow, \"not all toves will whiffle\" is similar to the first part. \"All toves will whiffle\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx), since F is [1] will whiffle. So \"not all\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). Again, could be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx), but maybe I should keep it as the negation of the universal.\n\nPutting it all together, the consequent is Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx).\n\nSo the entire statement is: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx)).\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any variable conflicts. The antecedent uses x, and the consequent also uses x in the inner negation. But since they are bound by different quantifiers, it's okay. Each x is a bound variable, so they are separate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use different variables, but since the variables are bound, it's acceptable. For example, in the antecedent, it's \u2200x(...), and in the consequent's implication, the consequent part is another \u2200x(...). But in logic, variables can be reused as long as they are bound correctly. So the formula should be correct as written.\n\nLet me check the abbreviations again to make sure I used them right:\n\n- M: [1] is a tove. So Mx means x is a tove.\n- P: [1] chortled at [2]. So Pxc is x chortled at c (Bungo).\n- c: Bungo.\n- b: Rafin. So Mb is Rafin is a tove.\n- F: [1] will whiffle. So Fx is x will whiffle.\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire implication is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx))\n\nI think that's the correct formalization. Let me see if there's another way to write the \"only if\" part. Since \"only if\" is a material implication, so Rafin is a tove (Mb) only if (the implication is that if Mb then the other part). So yes, Mb \u2192 ... is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: the original sentence says \"Rafin is a tove only if not all toves will whiffle.\" So if Rafin is a tove, then it must be that not all toves will whiffle. Which is exactly Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc)\u2192(Mb\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx))",

        },
        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is: \"A borogove is uffish if and only if no raths chortled at Zindle.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure seems to be a biconditional (if and only if) between two parts. The left side is \"A borogove is uffish,\" and the right side is \"no raths chortled at Zindle.\" \n\nLooking at the abbreviations provided: N is \"[1] is a borogove,\" K is \"[1] is uffish,\" O is \"[1] is a rath,\" P is \"[1] chortled at [2],\" and a is Zindle. \n\nStarting with the left side: \"A borogove is uffish.\" In predicate logic, when we say \"A X is Y,\" that usually translates to a universal statement. Like, for all x, if x is a X, then x is Y. So here, it would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Kx). Because \"A borogove is uffish\" is like saying all borogoves have the property of being uffish. \n\nNow the right side: \"no raths chortled at Zindle.\" The phrase \"no raths\" means there does not exist a rath that... So, it's the negation of the existence. So, \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Pxa). Because for \"raths chortled at Zindle,\" we'd have \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Pxa), meaning there exists an x that is a rath and chortled at a (Zindle). Therefore, \"no raths\" would be the negation of that, so \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Pxa). Alternatively, this can be written as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acPxa), using the universal quantifier. But since the original uses \"no raths,\" maybe the existential negation is more direct. However, both forms are equivalent. \n\nBut in the example given in the problem statement, the translation used a universal quantifier for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So maybe here, for consistency, using the universal quantifier might be better? Wait, \"no raths chortled at Zindle\" is equivalent to \"for all raths, they did not chortle at Zindle.\" So that would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acPxa). That seems correct. \n\nSo putting it all together, the biconditional between the two parts. The entire sentence is saying that for any borogove, being uffish is equivalent to the condition that no raths chortled at Zindle. Wait, but does \"A borogove is uffish\" mean that all borogoves are uffish, or that being a borogove implies being uffish? The original sentence is a bit ambiguous, but in the example given, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" was translated with a universal quantifier. So \"A borogove is uffish\" is likely similar to \"Every borogove is uffish,\" hence \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Kx). \n\nBut the biconditional is between that entire universal statement and the \"no raths...\"? Wait, no. Wait, the original sentence is \"A borogove is uffish if and only if no raths chortled at Zindle.\" So the structure is: For any borogove, it is uffish exactly when (iff) no raths chortled at Zindle. Wait, that seems like the biconditional is between Kx (for a borogove x) and the \"no raths...\" So perhaps the correct structure is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Kx \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pya)))? Or maybe the entire statement is that the property of being uffish for a borogove is equivalent to the non-existence of raths chortling at Zindle. \n\nWait, maybe the sentence is saying that any borogove is uffish exactly when it is the case that no raths chortled at Zindle. So for each borogove, its being uffish depends on whether the raths didn't chortle at Zindle. But that would mean that all borogoves have the same uffishness based on that condition. Alternatively, maybe the sentence is stating a general equivalence between the two propositions: \"All borogoves are uffish\" is equivalent to \"No raths chortled at Zindle.\" But the wording is \"A borogove is uffish if and only if...\" which sounds more like for each individual borogove, being uffish is equivalent to the condition. However, the condition is about raths and Zindle, which doesn't directly involve the borogove. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"A borogove is uffish if and only if no raths chortled at Zindle.\" The structure is similar to \"A cat is hungry iff no dogs are barking.\" How would we translate that? It would be that for all cats, the cat is hungry iff no dogs are barking. But that seems odd because the condition (no dogs barking) is a general condition, not dependent on the cat. But logically, the translation would be \u2200x (Cx \u2192 (Hx \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y (Dy \u2227 By))). So for every cat x, x is hungry iff there are no barking dogs. \n\nBut in reality, the truth of \"no dogs are barking\" is a single fact, so if that's true, then all cats are hungry; if it's false, then no cats are hungry? That's what the translation would imply. But maybe the original sentence is intended to mean that the entire set of borogoves being uffish (or all of them) is equivalent to the absence of raths chortling at Zindle. In that case, it would be (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Kx)) \u2194 (\u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pya)). \n\nBut how can we determine which interpretation is correct? The wording is ambiguous. However, in the example given, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" was translated as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc), which is a universal statement. The original sentence here starts with \"A borogove is uffish...\" which is similar to \"Every borogove is uffish...\" So if we take the structure as similar to the example, then the left side of the biconditional is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Kx), and the right side is \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pya). Therefore, the entire formula would be (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Kx)) \u2194 (\u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pya)). \n\nAlternatively, if the sentence is interpreted as for each borogove, being uffish is equivalent to the condition, then it would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Kx \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pya))). But that would mean that every borogove's uffishness depends on the same condition. However, the original sentence doesn't have a quantifier over borogoves in the left part; it's \"A borogove is uffish...\" which is a general statement about all borogoves. The \"if and only if\" connects two propositions: \"All borogoves are uffish\" and \"No raths chortled at Zindle.\" \n\nTherefore, the correct translation would be a biconditional between the universal statement about borogoves and the negated existential about raths. So the formula would be \u2200x(Nx\u2192Kx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Pya). \n\nBut let me check if there are other ways to express the right side. The negation of the existential can be written as a universal, so \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Pya) is equivalent to \u2200y(Oy \u2192 \u00acPya). So maybe the answer could also be written with that universal. But since the example used a universal for the implication, perhaps using the same structure here is better. However, the problem doesn't specify which form to use, just to use the abbreviations. \n\nSo the final formula is \u2200x(Nx\u2192Kx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Pya). Alternatively, using the universal form for the right side: \u2200x(Nx\u2192Kx) \u2194 \u2200y(Oy\u2192\u00acPya). Both are equivalent. But since the example used a universal for the implication, maybe the second form is more consistent. But the problem says to use the abbreviations given, and there's no preference indicated. \n\nBut the original instruction says to return a single well-formed formula. Either form is acceptable. However, in the example, the right side of the implication was Rxc, which is a two-place predicate. Here, the right side of the biconditional is a proposition (no raths...), not involving x. So the biconditional is between two propositions: one is the universal statement, the other is the negated existence. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x(Nx\u2192Kx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Pya). \n\nLet me check again. The sentence is \"A borogove is uffish if and only if no raths chortled at Zindle.\" So the entire left side is a statement about all borogoves, and the entire right side is a statement about raths and Zindle. The biconditional connects these two statements. So yes, the translation should be between the universal quantification and the negated existential. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \u2200x(Nx\u2192Kx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Pya). \n\nAlternatively, if written with the universal quantifier on the right, it's \u2200x(Nx\u2192Kx) \u2194 \u2200y(Oy\u2192\u00acPya). Both are correct, but perhaps the first is more direct since \"no raths\" is a negated existential. However, the example used a universal for the implication. But the example's right side was a two-place predicate with a constant. In this case, the right side is a proposition. \n\nEither way, both forms are logically equivalent. Since the problem allows any standard predicate logic syntax, either should be acceptable. But to match the example's style, maybe using the universal quantifier for the right side is better. Wait, the example used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is a universal. The right side here is a proposition, so maybe it's better to use the existential form. \n\nBut I think the key is to correctly capture the meaning. The right side is \"no raths chortled at Zindle,\" which is equivalent to \"it is not the case that there exists a rath that chortled at Zindle,\" so \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Pya). Therefore, that's the correct way to represent it. \n\nSo the final formula is \u2200x(Nx\u2192Kx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Pya).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Kx)\u2194\u00ac\u2203y(Oy\u2227Pya)",

But if it's \"a rath\" as in there exists a rath, then it's existential. But the way the sentence is structured, it's more likely that the first part is existential. For example, \"A dog is barking\" can mean \"There exists a dog that is barking.\" So maybe here, \"A rath is beamish\" translates to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). Then \"Bungo is a rath\" is Oc. So the whole formula is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 Oc.\n\nBut wait, maybe the first part is a universal. Let me check. If the original was \"Every rath is beamish,\" then it would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). But the original is \"A rath is beamish,\" which is different. The article \"a\" here is indefinite, so it's more likely existential. So the correct translation would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 Oc. That seems right. Let me make sure there's no other interpretation. Suppose the first part is a universal, then the translation would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2227 Oc. But then that would mean all raths are beamish and Bungo is a rath. But the original sentence doesn't say all raths are beamish, just that a (some) rath is beamish. So the existential makes more sense. Therefore, the correct formalization is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 Oc.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox\u2227Lx)\u2227Oc",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence we need to translate is: \"If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Rafin is beamish only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" The abbreviations given are O for [1] is a rath, P for [1] chortled at [2], b for Rafin, L for [1] is beamish, and Q for [1] galumphed over [2]. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure here is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, actually, the sentence says \"If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Rafin is beamish only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" So the structure is \"If A, then (B only if C).\" \n\nIn logic, \"only if\" is a bit tricky. Normally, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So the entire sentence can be seen as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C), where A is \"every rath chortled at Rafin,\" B is \"Rafin is beamish,\" and C is \"every rath galumphed over Rafin.\"\n\nLet me confirm that. The original sentence is structured as: If A, then (B only if C). So translating \"B only if C\" as B \u2192 C makes the whole thing A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). \n\nNow, let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst, A: \"Every rath chortled at Rafin.\" Using the abbreviations, O is [1] is a rath, and P is [1] chortled at [2]. So \"every rath chortled at Rafin\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb). Because for all x, if x is a rath (Ox), then x chortled at b (Rafin).\n\nNext, B: \"Rafin is beamish.\" Since L is [1] is beamish, this would be Lb.\n\nC: \"Every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" Q is [1] galumphed over [2], so again, \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). For all x, if x is a rath, then x galumphed over b.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is: If \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb), then (Lb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)). \n\nSo the formalization would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (Lb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)). \n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any variable conflicts. The first part uses x, and the second part also uses x in the universal quantifier. However, since they are both bound by their own quantifiers, it's okay. The scope of each quantifier is separate. So the formula should be correct.\n\nLet me write it out properly with the correct symbols. The main connective is the implication between the two parts. The antecedent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb), and the consequent is Lb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb) \u2192 (Lb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb))\n\nI think that's it. Let me double-check each part again. The first part is every rath chortled at b. The second part is if Lb (Rafin is beamish) then every rath galumphed over b. The structure of the original sentence is indeed \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C).

The abbreviations are M for \"[1] is a tove\", O for \"[1] is a rath\", and R for \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\". \n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Every tove\" suggests a universal quantifier. So, for all x, if x is a tove, then something happens. The structure would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ...). \n\nNow, the verb part is \"snicker-snacked a rath\". The verb here is R, which takes two arguments: the subject and the object. The object here is \"a rath\", which is an existential quantifier. So, for each tove x, there exists some y that is a rath such that x snicker-snacks y. \n\nPutting that together, the existential part would be \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Rxy). Because \"a rath\" means there exists a rath, and the action R connects the tove x to that rath y.\n\nSo combining the universal and existential quantifiers, the formula should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Rxy)). \n\nWait, let me check. The original sentence says \"Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.\" So each tove does the action to some rath. So yes, for every x that's a tove, there's at least one y that's a rath, and x R y. That seems correct. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not mixing up any quantifiers. If it were \"All toves snicker-snacked the same rath,\" it would be \u2203y (Oy \u2227 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxy)), but that's not the case here. The original sentence uses \"a rath,\" which implies each tove has their own rath. So the existential is inside the universal's implication. \n\nSo the correct formalization is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Rxy)). \n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations.

The sentence to formalize is: \"A rath is beamish and not all borogoves will whiffle.\" The abbreviations provided are O, L, N, and F.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"A rath is beamish.\" Using the abbreviations, O stands for \"[1] is a rath\" and L is \"[1] is beamish.\" So, \"A rath is beamish\" translates to the existence of something that is a rath and beamish. In predicate logic, that would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). Because it's saying there's at least one rath that is beamish.\n\nNext, the second part is \"not all borogoves will whiffle.\" The abbreviation N is \"[1] is a borogove\" and F is \"[1] will whiffle.\" The phrase \"not all\" usually translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. So \"all borogoves will whiffle\" would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx). Therefore, \"not all borogoves will whiffle\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx). Alternatively, this can be expressed using an existential quantifier with the negation inside, which would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acFx). But I need to check which form is more appropriate here. The original statement is \"not all,\" which is the negation of a universal, so \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx) is correct. However, sometimes it's preferable to push the negation inside for equivalence. But since the problem says to use standard syntax, either form is logically equivalent. But perhaps the expected answer is the direct negation of the universal.\n\nPutting the two parts together, the entire sentence is a conjunction of these two statements. So the full formalization would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx). Alternatively, if we use the existential form for the second part, it would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acFx). But I need to see which one is more accurate based on the original sentence. The original says \"not all borogoves will whiffle,\" which directly translates to the negation of the universal statement. However, in predicate logic, \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx) is equivalent to \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acFx). But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax. Since the user didn't specify to convert the negation, maybe it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx) unless instructed otherwise. However, in formal logic, sometimes the preferred form is to have the negation inside, but the problem might accept either. Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So they used the universal with implication. So for \"not all,\" the negation of that structure would be \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx). Therefore, the correct formalization here would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx). \n\nBut let me make sure there's no ambiguity. The first part is straightforward: a rath exists that is beamish. The second part is the negation of \"all borogoves will whiffle.\" So combining them with a conjunction. So the final formula is the conjunction of \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) and \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Fx). That should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox\u2227Lx)\u2227\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Fx)",

First, I need to parse the sentence: \"If Rafin is a tove, then not all toves will whiffle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" \n\nThe abbreviations given are:\n- M: [1] is a tove\n- b: Rafin\n- F: [1] will whiffle\n- N: [1] is a borogove\n- P: [1] chortled at [2]\n- c: Bungo\n\nSo the sentence starts with a conditional: If Rafin is a tove... So that's M(b), since Rafin is represented by b and M is the predicate for being a tove. \n\nThe then part is a bit more complex: \"not all toves will whiffle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" Let's break that down. The phrase \"only if\" usually introduces a necessary condition. So \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the structure is \"not all toves will whiffle only if...\" So the \"not all toves will whiffle\" is the A part, and \"every borogove chortled at Bungo\" is B. So this part would be (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx)) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc). Wait, but the entire original sentence is \"If Rafin is a tove, then [this implication].\" So the whole thing is M(b) \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx)) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc) ].\n\nBut let me check if I got the structure right. The original sentence is structured as: If A, then (B only if C). Which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that seems correct. \n\nNow, let's make sure about the negation. \"Not all toves will whiffle\" is equivalent to \"There exists a tove that will not whiffle,\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2261 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). But in the formalization, I can keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) without converting it, unless required. The problem says to use the abbreviations provided, so I should use M, F, N, P, etc., as they are. \n\nSo putting it all together: The entire formula is M(b) \u2192 [ \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc) ].\n\nWait, but in predicate logic, implications can be nested. So the structure is correct. Let me check the order again. The sentence is \"If Rafin is a tove, then [not all toves will whiffle] only if [every borogove chortled at Bungo].\" So the \"only if\" connects the two parts. So the part after \"then\" is \"B only if C\", which is B \u2192 C. Therefore, the entire formula is: M(b) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc)).\n\nAlternatively, could there be a different interpretation? Let me think. Maybe the \"only if\" is part of the \"not all toves will whiffle only if...\" which might mean that the entire conditional is structured differently.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If every rath is mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Bungo only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" \n\nLet me start with the antecedent of the main conditional: \"every rath is mimsy.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a rath\" and J is \"[1] is mimsy\". So, translating \"every rath is mimsy\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the consequent is \"Bungo galumphed over Bungo only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So, the structure here would be: Q(c, c) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c)). Let me check that. \n\nBreaking down the consequent: \"Bungo galumphed over Bungo\" is Q(c, c). The \"only if\" part is \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" The statement \"all toves galumphed over Bungo\" would be \u2200y (My \u2192 Q(y, c)), so the negation is \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Q(y, c)). \n\nPutting it together, the consequent is Q(c, c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Q(y, c)). \n\nNow, combining the antecedent and consequent with the main conditional (\u2192), the entire formula becomes:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [Q(c, c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Q(y, c))]\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly scoped. Let me check again. The main conditional is \"If A, then B\", where A is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) and B is the \"only if\" statement. So yes, the entire formula is A \u2192 B. \n\nBut let me also check if the \"only if\" translation is correct. The original phrase is \"B galumphed over B only if not all toves galumphed over B.\" So, the \"only if\" introduces a necessary condition. So, for Bungo's galumphing to be true, it's necessary that not all toves galumphed over Bungo. Therefore, Q(c,c) can only be true if \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Q(y,c)), which is equivalent to \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acQ(y,c)). But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard logic symbols. So I should stick with the negation of the universal quantifier, which is \u00ac\u2200y(...). \n\nSo the consequent is Q(c,c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Q(y,c)). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formalization would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Qcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qyc))\n\nI need to make sure that all variables are properly quantified. The main formula is an implication where the antecedent is a universal statement and the consequent is another implication. \n\nLet me check for any possible mistakes. The abbreviations are O, J, Q, c, M. The variables x and y are used, but they are bound by quantifiers. The use of Q with two arguments is correct as per the abbreviation. \n\nYes, this seems correct. So the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Jx)\u2192(Qcc\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Qyc))\n\nI think that's it.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure of the sentence is a conditional: \"If Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath chortled at Rafin only if no borogoves are beamish.\" So, the overall form is If A, then B. Where A is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin\" and B is the rest.\n\nStarting with A: \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin.\" Using the abbreviation R for \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\", and since both subjects are Rafin (denoted by b), this would be \u00acRbb. Because it's negated, and it's the same entity doing and receiving the action.\n\nNow the consequent B: \"every rath chortled at Rafin only if no borogoves are beamish.\" Let's parse this. The phrase \"every rath chortled at Rafin only if...\" suggests that the chortling by raths is conditional on the borogoves not being beamish. \n\nBreaking down \"every rath chortled at Rafin\": For all x, if x is a rath (Ox), then x chortled at Rafin (Pxr, where r is Rafin, which is b). So that would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb).\n\nBut this is modified by \"only if no borogoves are beamish.\" The \"only if\" indicates that the condition (no borogoves are beamish) is necessary for the antecedent (every rath chortled at Rafin). In logic terms, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. Wait, no, actually, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, the entire statement \"every rath chortled at Rafin\" is the A, and \"no borogoves are beamish\" is B. So the structure would be (every rath chortled at Rafin) \u2192 (no borogoves are beamish).\n\nBut \"no borogoves are beamish\" is equivalent to saying for all x, if x is a borogove (Nx), then x is not beamish (\u00acLx). So that's \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx).\n\nPutting it all together, the consequent B is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx).\n\nNow, combining A and B in the main conditional. The entire sentence is: If \u00acRbb, then [\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)]. \n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. So the entire formula would be \u00acRbb \u2192 [\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)]. \n\nAlternatively, using logical equivalences, an implication A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem states to use standard syntax, so I should keep it as is unless there's a need to restructure. However, since the problem asks for a well-formed formula, the way I have it is acceptable.\n\nLet me check the abbreviations again to make sure I used the right ones. \n\nR is [1] snicker-snacked [2], so Rbb is correct. The negation is \u00acRbb.\n\nO is [1] is a rath, so Ox for any x.\n\nP is [1] chortled at [2], so Pxb where x is the rath and b (Rafin) is the second argument.\n\nN is [1] is a borogove, Nx.\n\nL is [1] is beamish, so Lx. The negation is \u00acLx.\n\nSo the \"no borogoves are beamish\" is indeed \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx).\n\nPutting it all together, the formalization should be:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications are right-associative, but to be explicit, parentheses are needed. Alternatively, we can write it as \u00acRbb \u2192 [\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)].\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me check if there's any possible misinterpretation. The original sentence says \"every rath chortled at Rafin only if no borogoves are beamish.\" The \"only if\" here binds the entire \"every rath...\" part to the condition. So the structure is correct as an implication where the antecedent is the every rath part and the consequent is the no borogoves part. Therefore, the formalization is accurate.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRbb\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If Zindle will whiffle, then...\" So the antecedent is \"Zindle will whiffle,\" which translates using the abbreviation F for \"will whiffle\" and a for Zindle. That would be Fa.\n\nThe consequent is \"every rath is mimsy only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" Let's parse that. The phrase \"only if\" usually introduces a necessary condition. So \"every rath is mimsy only if...\" means that the mimsy-ness of all raths depends on the condition that no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\nBreaking down the consequent: \"every rath is mimsy\" can be expressed as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx), where Ox means \"x is a rath\" and Jx means \"x is mimsy.\" The \"only if\" part connects this to the negation of any rath galumphing over Bungo. The \"no raths galumphed over Bungo\" would be \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxb), since Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2]\" and c is Bungo, so Qxc. Wait, but Bungo is the object here, so for each rath x, Qx c (x galumphed over c). So \"no raths galumphed over Bungo\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc).\n\nSo putting the \"only if\" together: The entire consequent is that \"every rath is mimsy\" implies \"no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" Wait, no\u2014because \"only if\" reverses the direction. If we have P only if Q, that translates to P \u2192 Q. Here, P is \"every rath is mimsy\" and Q is \"no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" Wait, but actually, the structure is \"every rath is mimsy only if [condition].\" So the \"only if\" applies to each instance? Or is it a universal statement?\n\nWait, let's think again. The original is \"every rath is mimsy only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" So the entire statement \"every rath is mimsy\" is true only if \"no raths galumphed over Bungo\" is true. So the whole thing is: If every rath is mimsy, then no raths galumphed over Bungo. But the original sentence says \"every rath is mimsy only if no raths...\", which is equivalent to \"if every rath is mimsy, then no raths...\" So the consequent of the main conditional is (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc). Alternatively, that implication can be written as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc), but maybe the first way is better.\n\nPutting it all together: The main conditional is Fa \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc) ) ]\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can use the equivalence of P \u2192 Q being equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. But here, the structure is straightforward.\n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\nFa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc) )\n\nAlternatively, since implications are right-associative, maybe we don't need the inner parentheses. But to be safe, we can write:\n\nFa \u2192 ( ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc) ) )\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations again. Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", and c is Bungo. So Qxc would be x galumphed over c. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to write \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc) is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). So maybe that's preferable for the final formula. Let me see. Both are equivalent. Let's pick one. Since the original uses \"no raths\", which is a universal negative, perhaps using the universal quantifier is better. So:\n\nFa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) )\n\nBut then, we have two universal quantifiers, but they are both over x. Wait, but the first \u2200x is for Ox \u2192 Jx, and the second is Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc. So combining them, but in the implication. So the entire consequent is that if all raths are mimsy, then all raths did not galump over Bungo.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula is:\n\nFa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) )\n\nAlternatively, since the two universal quantifiers can be combined, but they are separate. However, in formal logic, the variables are bound in their own scope. So the formula is correct as written.\n\nBut perhaps we can write it more concisely. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal consequent: \"every rath is mimsy only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\nIn logical terms, \"only if\" between two statements A and B is A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"every rath is mimsy\" and B is \"no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" Therefore, the consequent is A \u2192 B, which is \u2200x (Ox\u2192Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc). So the entire formula is Fa \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox\u2192Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc)].\n\nAlternatively, using the universal form for B: \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc) is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). So substituting that, the consequent becomes \u2200x (Ox\u2192Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox\u2192\u00acQxc). Therefore, the entire formula can be written either way. Either is acceptable, but perhaps using the universal form is preferable for consistency.\n\nThus, the final translation is:\n\nFa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) )\n\nNow, checking for proper syntax. Quantifiers are \u2200 and \u2203, connectives are \u2192, etc. The formula uses standard symbols. The abbreviations are correctly applied: F for \"will whiffle\" with a (Zindle), O for \"is a rath\", J for \"is mimsy\", Q for \"galumphed over\" with c (Bungo).

The sentence is: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo and only borogoves gyred.\" The abbreviations given are M for toves, Q for galumphed over, c for Bungo, N for borogoves, and H for gyred.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into two parts. The first part is \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" The second part is \"only borogoves gyred.\" Let me handle each part separately and then combine them with a conjunction.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" can be translated as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 \u00acB(x)). But here, it's \"No toves (M) galumphed over Bungo (c).\" So, for all x, if x is a tove (Mx), then it is not the case that x galumphed over c (\u00acQxc). So the first part would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxc).\n\nNow the second part: \"only borogoves gyred.\" The structure here is \"Only N (borogoves) H (gyred).\" In logic, \"Only N are H\" means that if something gyred, then it must be a borogove. So it's \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Nx). Because if something gyred, then it is a borogove. That's how \"only\" works here\u2014restricting the H to N.\n\nNow, combining both parts with a conjunction. The original sentence uses \"and,\" so we need to connect the two formulas with \u2227. So the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxc) \u2227 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Nx)\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any quantifier scope issues or if variables are properly handled. Both parts are universal quantifiers, so combining them with \u2227 is correct. Also, the variables in each quantifier are bound to their own scope. Since both are universally quantified over x, but they are separate statements, so combining them with \u2227 is appropriate.\n\nLet me double-check. The first part says all toves didn't galumph over Bungo. The second part says all things that gyred are borogoves. Yes, that captures \"only borogoves gyred.\" So the translation seems right. I don't think I need to use any existential quantifiers here. Also, the abbreviations are used correctly: M, Q, c, N, H. No other symbols are needed. So the final formula should be the conjunction of those two universal statements.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acQxc)\u2227\u2200x(Hx\u2192Nx)",

The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If every borogove is mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" So the overall form is If A, then (B only if C). \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"every borogove is mimsy.\" Using the abbreviations, N is \"[1] is a borogove\" and J is \"[1] is mimsy.\" So this part would translate to \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). That's straightforward, similar to the example given.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is equivalent to P \u2192 Q. So here, P is \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle\" and Q is \"every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nTranslating P: Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", with c (Bungo) as the first argument and a (Zindle) as the second. So Qca.\n\nTranslating Q: \"every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" The abbreviation P is \"[1] chortled at [2]\". So for every x, if Nx (x is a borogove), then Pxp, where p is Bungo (c). So \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nPutting the consequent together: Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc). \n\nNow combining the antecedent and consequent: The entire statement is the antecedent (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx)) implying the consequent (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)). So the whole formula would be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nWait, but in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if there's any variable conflict. The antecedent uses x, and the consequent also uses x in the universal quantifier. But since they're in different scopes, it's okay. The x in the consequent is a separate quantifier. So the formula is valid.\n\nLet me double-check the \"only if\" part again. The original says \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" So that's Qca only if \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc), which translates to Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc). Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the entire formalization should be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nI think that's it. All abbreviations are used correctly. Quantifiers are properly applied. The structure follows the conditional and the \"only if\" correctly. No variables are left unbound. The connectives are appropriately used.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the sentence is: \"If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Rafin won't whiffle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" And I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure seems to be a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the phrasing here is a bit tricky. The original sentence is structured as \"If A, then (B only if C).\" In logic, \"only if\" usually translates to an implication where the consequent is necessary for the antecedent. So \"B only if C\" would be B \u2192 C. But here, the entire \"Rafin won't whiffle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo\" is the consequent of the main conditional. So the main structure is: If (every rath chortled at Rafin), then (\u00acF(b) only if \u00ac\u2203 rath galumphed over c). \n\nLet me rephrase the sentence for clarity. The main conditional is: If every rath chortled at Rafin (A), then [Rafin won't whiffle (\u00acF(b)) only if no raths galumphed over Bungo (\u00ac\u2203x (O(x) \u2227 Q(x, c)) )]. \n\nSo translating \"only if\" here: \"\u00acF(b) only if \u00ac\u2203x (O(x) \u2227 Q(x, c))\" would be \u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (O(x) \u2227 Q(x, c)). Alternatively, that could be written as \u00acF(b) \u2192 \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)), since the negation of \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qx) is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQx). But maybe the first form is simpler here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire statement is: A \u2192 (\u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c))). \n\nNow, let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst part A: \"Every rath chortled at Rafin.\" Using the abbreviations, O is [1] is a rath, P is [1] chortled at [2], and b is Rafin. So \"Every rath chortled at Rafin\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, b)). \n\nThen the consequent is \u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)). Let me check that. The consequent is \"Rafin won't whiffle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" So \"Rafin won't whiffle\" is \u00acF(b). \"No raths galumphed over Bungo\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)), since Q is [1] galumphed over [2], and c is Bungo. \n\nSo combining these, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)))\n\nAlternatively, using logical equivalences, we can write the consequent as \u00acF(b) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)), but the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax. The original translation using \u2203 and \u00ac is acceptable.\n\nNow, I need to check if I have all the abbreviations correctly applied. Let me verify:\n\n- O: [1] is a rath. So Ox means x is a rath.\n- P: [1] chortled at [2]. So P(x, b) means x chortled at Rafin (since b is Rafin).\n- F: [1] will whiffle. So F(b) is Rafin will whiffle. Therefore, \u00acF(b) is Rafin won't whiffle.\n- Q: [1] galumphed over [2]. So Q(x, c) is x galumphed over Bungo (since c is Bungo).\n- b is Rafin, c is Bungo.\n\nYes, that all seems correct. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)))\n\nBut in formal logic, we need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly placed. Also, the implication arrows need to be correctly nested. Let me check the parentheses again. The main connective is the implication between the antecedent (every rath chortled...) and the consequent (the \"only if\" part). The consequent itself is another implication: \u00acF(b) \u2192 ... \n\nYes, that's correct. So the entire formula is structured as:\n\n[\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, b))] \u2192 [\u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c))]\n\nAlternatively, since implications can be chained, but in this case, it's a conditional where the consequent is another conditional. So the formula is correct as written.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no free variables. All variables are bound by quantifiers. The variables in the antecedent are bound by \u2200x. The variables in the consequent's \u2203x are bound by \u2203x. So that's okay.\n\nAnother thing to check: the use of \"only if\". The structure \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So in this case, \"Rafin won't whiffle only if no raths...\" translates to \u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x... So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final formalization should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192P(x,b))\u2192(\u00acFb\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Ox\u2227Q(x,c)))\n\nI need to write this without spaces, using the correct symbols. Also, since the problem says to return a single well-formed formula, I need to ensure proper use of parentheses. Let me check again:\n\nThe main implication is between the universal quantifier and the implication. So the entire formula is:\n\n(\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x,b))) \u2192 (\u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x,c)))\n\nBut in formal notation, parentheses are important. Let me make sure that the scope of the quantifiers is correct. Also, since implication is right-associative, but to be safe, I'll include parentheses as needed.\n\nYes, the formula as written is correct. Now, translating this into the required format with the abbreviations and symbols. The example used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), so following that style, variables are in the quantifiers, and predicates are written with the terms.\n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192P(x,b))\u2192(\u00acFb\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Ox\u2227Q(x,c)))\n\nI think that's it. Let me check once more for any possible mistakes. The main conditional is correct. The translation of \"every rath\" as a universal quantifier is correct. The \"only if\" part is correctly translated as an implication. The use of \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x,c)) for \"no raths galumphed over Bungo\" is correct. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192P(x,b))\u2192(\u00acFb\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Ox\u2227Q(x,c)))",

The antecedent is \"a tove galumphed over Rafin,\" and the consequent is \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"a tove galumphed over Rafin.\" This seems like an existential statement. There exists some tove (let's say x) such that x galumphed over Rafin (b). So in predicate logic, that would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Q(x, b)). Wait, but sometimes \"a tove\" could be interpreted as there exists a tove, so maybe it's \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Q(x, b)). That makes sense because we're saying there's at least one tove that did the action.\n\nNow the consequent: \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This means that for all toves, they did not snicker-snack Zindle. So it's a universal statement. For all x, if x is a tove, then it is not the case that R(x, a). So \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acR(x, a)). Alternatively, it could also be phrased as \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 R(x, a)), which says there doesn't exist a tove that snicker-snacked Zindle. Both are equivalent, but maybe the universal form is more direct here.\n\nPutting it together, the entire conditional would be: If \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Q(x, b)), then \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acR(x, a)). \n\nWait, but in predicate logic, when we have conditionals with quantifiers, sometimes the structure requires careful handling. Let me check again. The antecedent is an existential statement, and the consequent is a universal one. So the overall structure is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Q(x, b)) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acR(x, a)).\n\nI need to make sure that the variables are correctly scoped. The existential quantifier in the antecedent and the universal in the consequent use the same variable x, but they are in different scopes, so that's okay. The formula should be well-formed.\n\nLet me verify if there's another way. For example, could the consequent be written as \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acR(y, a))? Yes, because the variable name doesn't matter as long as it's bound. So the final formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Q(x, b)) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acR(y, a))\n\nBut since the variable names are arbitrary, using x in both is acceptable, but sometimes using different variables can avoid confusion. However, in formal logic, it's allowed to reuse variables in different scopes. So both versions are correct. However, in the example given in the problem statement, they used x in both the antecedent and the consequent (though in the example, the consequent was Rxc, which used the same x). Wait, in the example, the formalization was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So in that case, the antecedent was a universal, and the consequent used the same x. But in our case, the antecedent is an existential. So perhaps using different variables is better to avoid confusion, but logically, it's the same. \n\nHowever, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. So either way is acceptable. Let me go with using different variables for clarity. So:\n\n\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Q(x, b)) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acR(y, a))\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify variable names, maybe it's okay to use x in both. Let me check. Suppose I write:\n\n\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Q(x, b)) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acR(x, a))\n\nIs this acceptable? Yes, because the x in the existential and the x in the universal are different variables (due to the scopes). The existential quantifier's x is only in the antecedent, and the universal's x is in the consequent. So they are separate. However, sometimes people prefer to use different variables for clarity. But in formal logic, it's allowed. \n\nThe example uses x in both parts. For instance, in the example, the formula is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). The antecedent is Lx and the consequent is Rxc. So perhaps following the example, we can use x in both parts here. Therefore, the formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Q(x, b)) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acR(x, a))\n\nBut maybe some would argue that using different variables is better. However, since the problem doesn't specify, and the example uses the same variable in different scopes, I think it's acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the final formalization is:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Q(x,b)) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acR(x,a))\n\nAlternatively, if we use a different variable in the consequent:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Q(x,b)) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 \u00acR(y,a))\n\nBoth are correct. Which one is preferred? The example uses x in both parts. Let me check the example again. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). The antecedent is Lx, the consequent is Rxc. So the same variable x. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects the same variable here. However, in our case, the antecedent is an existential and the consequent is a universal. But the example's antecedent is a universal. \n\nBut regardless, the key is that the formula is well-formed. Both versions are. However, to match the example's style, perhaps using x in both is better. So I'll proceed with that.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Q(x,b)) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acR(x,a))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. \n\nFirst, the main structure of the sentence is a conditional: \"If Rafin is beamish, then...\" So the first part is Lb, since L is \"[1] is beamish\" and b is Rafin. Then the consequence is a bit more complicated: \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" \n\nLet me parse the consequence part. The phrase \"only if\" in logic usually translates to an implication where the condition is necessary. So \"A only if B\" is B \u2192 A. Wait, no, actually, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. Because for A to happen, B must be true. So if the sentence says \"A only if B\", it's A \u2192 B.\n\nSo the original part is \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" Let me rephrase that. Let me call \"all toves galumphed over Bungo\" as A, and \"no raths galumphed over Bungo\" as B. Then the structure is \"not A only if B\", which would translate to (not A) \u2192 B. Wait, but \"only if\" here is tricky. Let me think again. The original phrase is \"not all toves... only if no raths...\" So the \"only if\" connects the two parts. So the entire structure is: (not all toves galumphed over Bungo) only if (no raths galumphed over Bungo). So using the \"A only if B\" structure, which is A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"not all toves...\", so the translation would be (not all toves...) \u2192 (no raths...). \n\nNow, let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst, \"all toves galumphed over Bungo\" is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc), since Mx means x is a tove, and Qx c means x galumphed over c (Bungo). Therefore, \"not all toves...\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc), but maybe the problem expects to keep it as the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nThen, \"no raths galumphed over Bungo\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). Because if x is a rath (Ox), then it did not galumph over c. \n\nPutting it together, the consequence part is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). \n\nSo the entire sentence is Lb \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc)]. \n\nWait, but in logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if there's a way to simplify or represent this correctly. The main connective here is the implication from Lb to the rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire structure. The original sentence is: If Lb, then (\u00acA \u2192 B), where A is \"all toves...\", and B is \"no raths...\". So the entire formula would be Lb \u2192 (\u00acA \u2192 B). Which is equivalent to Lb \u2192 (B \u2228 \u00acA), but perhaps it's better to keep it as an implication. \n\nSo putting all together, the formalization should be:\n\nLb \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications are right-associative, so this is acceptable. However, sometimes people might prefer to use parentheses to make it clear. Alternatively, using logical equivalences, we can note that (P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R)) is equivalent to (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 R. But maybe the problem expects the direct translation without reordering. \n\nLet me check again the original sentence: \"If Rafin is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\" \n\nBreaking down:\n\n- If Lb (Rafin is beamish), then [ (not all toves galumphed over Bungo) only if (no raths galumphed over Bungo) ]\n\nAs established, the \"only if\" part is (not all toves...) \u2192 (no raths...). Therefore, the entire implication is Lb \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx\u2192Qxc)) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox\u2192\u00acQxc) ]\n\nSo this seems correct. \n\nNow, let me check if there's any alternative way. For example, could the \"only if\" be part of a biconditional? Probably not. \"Only if\" is a one-way implication. \n\nAnother point: The \"no raths galumphed over Bungo\" is indeed \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). Because for all x, if x is a rath, then x did not galumph over Bungo. \n\nSo I think that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\nLb \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence between implications, but I think the problem expects the direct translation. \n\nI don't see any errors in this reasoning. Let me just write it out properly with the correct symbols.\n</think>\n\nLb\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00acQxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the sentence carefully. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo, then every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\nStarting with the abbreviations provided:\n- R: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\n- c: Bungo\n- O: [1] is a rath\n- J: [1] is mimsy\n- M: [1] is a tove\n- Q: [1] galumphed over [2]\n\nFirst, let's break down the main structure. The sentence is a conditional: If P, then Q. The antecedent is \"Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo,\" and the consequent is \"every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\" Using the abbreviation R, this would be \u00acR(c, c). Because R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], and both are Bungo, so the first argument is c (Bungo) and the second is also c. So the antecedent is \u00acRcc.\n\nNow the consequent: \"every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" The phrase \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So if we have \"every rath is mimsy only if [something],\" it would mean that for every rath, if it is mimsy, then [something]. Wait, but the structure here is a bit different. Let me think again.\n\nThe consequent is \"every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" So the \"only if\" connects the entire \"every rath is mimsy\" with the \"not all toves...\" So it's like saying: (Every rath is mimsy) \u2192 (not all toves galumphed over Bungo). But how is that structured?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"only if\" applies to each individual rath. Let me rephrase: For every rath, if it is mimsy, then it's only if not all toves... Hmm, that might not make sense. Wait, the original sentence is \"every rath is mimsy only if not all toves...\" So the entire statement \"every rath is mimsy\" is the antecedent of the \"only if\" clause. So the structure is: If every rath is mimsy, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo. Which would be (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qy c). Because \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" is equivalent to \"there exists a tove that did not galumph over Bungo,\" which is \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) or \u2203y(My \u2227 \u00acQyc). Either form is acceptable, but since the original uses \"not all,\" which is the negation of a universal, I'll use \u00ac\u2200y(...).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication is: \u00acRcc \u2192 [ (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) ].\n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"If Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo, then [every rath is mimsy only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo].\" So the consequent is the \"only if\" statement. So the consequent is structured as (every rath is mimsy) \u2192 (not all toves...). Therefore, the entire implication is \u00acRcc \u2192 [ (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) ].\n\nBut in formal logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, could we write the consequent as \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc)))? Wait, that would be if the \"only if\" applies to each rath individually. But the original says \"every rath is mimsy only if...\", which is a universal statement about raths being mimsy as a whole. Let me check the meaning again.\n\nThe phrase \"every rath is mimsy only if...\" is equivalent to saying that the only way for every rath to be mimsy is if the condition about the toves holds. So if every rath is mimsy, then the tove condition must hold. So that's indeed (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc). Therefore, the consequent is that implication.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acRcc \u2192 [ (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) ].\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can also write this as \u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc)), since A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. But perhaps the original structure is better kept as an implication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"only if\" is part of the consequent. Let me make sure. The original sentence is: If A, then (B only if C). Which is If A, then (B \u2192 C). So yes, the consequent is B \u2192 C, where B is \"every rath is mimsy\" and C is \"not all toves...\".\n\nSo the correct formalization is \u00acRcc \u2192 ( (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) )\n\nNow, I need to check if all abbreviations are used correctly. The abbreviations are:\n\nR: [1] snicker-snacked [2] \u2192 R(c,c) is Bungo snicker-snacked Bungo. So \u00acR(c,c) is correct.\n\nO: [1] is a rath \u2192 Ox is x is a rath.\n\nJ: [1] is mimsy \u2192 Jx is x is mimsy.\n\nM: [1] is a tove \u2192 My is y is a tove.\n\nQ: [1] galumphed over [2] \u2192 Qy c is y galumphed over Bungo.\n\nSo the part \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) is correct for \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) )\n\nNow, in predicate logic, it's acceptable to have nested implications. So this should be the correct formalization.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other parts. The original sentence doesn't mention anything else. The abbreviations are all accounted for. So this should be the correct formula.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcc\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Jx)\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Qyc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is: \"Every tove snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"is a tove,\" O for \"is a rath,\" and R for \"snicker-snacked.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure seems to be \"Every tove snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\" So, it's saying that for all toves, they snicker-snack every rath that has snicker-snacked them. So there's a reciprocal relationship here between toves and raths.\n\nLet me parse it step by step. The main quantifiers here would be \"Every tove\" and \"every rath.\" The phrase \"that snicker-snacked it\" adds a condition on the rath. So, for every tove, and for every rath that snicker-snacked that tove, the tove snicker-snacks the rath.\n\nSo, starting with the first part: \"Every tove...\" translates to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ...). Then, inside that, we need to express that this tove (x) snicker-snacks every rath (y) that snicker-snacked x. So for all y, if y is a rath and R(y, x) (y snicker-snacked x), then R(x, y) (x snicker-snacks y). \n\nWait, but the original sentence says \"every rath that snicker-snacked it.\" So \"it\" refers back to the tove. So the rath (y) must be such that R(y, x) holds. And we need to make sure y is a rath (Oy). Therefore, the inner part is \u2200y [(Oy \u2227 R(y, x)) \u2192 R(x, y)].\n\nPutting it all together: For all x, if x is a tove, then for all y, if y is a rath and y snicker-snacked x, then x snicker-snacks y. So the formalization would be:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2227 Ryx \u2192 Rxy))\n\nWait, but in predicate logic, the order of the arguments in R matters. The abbreviation R is \"[1] snicker-snacked [2].\" So R(a, b) means a snicker-snacks b. So in the sentence, \"every rath that snicker-snacked it\" would be R(y, x), because the rath (y) snicker-snacked the tove (x). Then the tove (x) snicker-snacks the rath (y), which is R(x, y).\n\nTherefore, the correct implication is: if y is a rath and R(y, x), then R(x, y). So the inner part is \u2200y [(Oy \u2227 R(y, x)) \u2192 R(x, y)]. And this has to be true for all x that are toves. So the entire formula is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ( (Oy \u2227 R y x) \u2192 R x y )).\n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly nested. The outer quantifier is \u2200x, and inside, for each x, we have \u2200y. So the structure is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ( ... )).\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2227 Ryx \u2192 Rxy))\n\nBut I need to check if there are any parentheses issues. In predicate logic, the scope of the quantifiers and the connectives must be correct. The \u2200y applies to the entire implication. So written properly, it's \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ((Oy \u2227 Ryx) \u2192 Rxy)).\n\nYes, that's the correct structure. So the answer should be:\n\n\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u2200y((Oy \u2227 Ryx) \u2192 Rxy))\n\nI think that's it. Let me double-check the original sentence. \"Every tove snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\" So for each tove x, and for every rath y that snicker-snacked x, x snicker-snacks y. Which is exactly what the formula says. The formula states that for all x, if x is a tove, then for all y, if y is a rath and y snicker-snacked x, then x snicker-snacks y. That matches the English sentence.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u2200y((Oy\u2227Ryx)\u2192Rxy))",

The sentence is a bit tricky, but I'll try to parse it carefully.\n\nThe sentence says: \"If Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then Bungo is beamish only if Rafin is beamish.\"\n\nFirst, let's identify the components and their corresponding abbreviations. The abbreviations given are:\n\n- R: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\n- b: Rafin\n- L: [1] is beamish\n- c: Bungo\n\nSo, the first part of the sentence is the antecedent of a conditional: \"Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.\" Using the abbreviation R, this would be \u00acR(b, b), since both the subject and object are Rafin (represented by b).\n\nThe consequent is \"Bungo is beamish only if Rafin is beamish.\" The phrase \"only if\" in logic typically translates to a conditional where the \"only if\" part is the consequent. So \"A only if B\" becomes A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"Bungo is beamish\" and B is \"Rafin is beamish.\" Using the abbreviations, Bungo is c, so Lc (since L is [1] is beamish). Rafin is b, so Lb. Therefore, the consequent becomes Lc \u2192 Lb.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is a conditional where the antecedent is \u00acR(b, b) and the consequent is (Lc \u2192 Lb). So the formalization would be:\n\n\u00acR(b, b) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 Lb)\n\nI need to make sure there are no quantifiers here. The original sentence doesn't mention anything about all people or some people, just specific individuals (Rafin and Bungo). So no need for \u2200 or \u2203. Also, check that all abbreviations are correctly used. R is a two-place predicate, so R(b, b) is correct. L is a one-place predicate, so Lc and Lb are correct. The constants b and c are correctly assigned to Rafin and Bungo respectively.\n\nAnother thing to check is the structure of the implication. The main connective is the implication from the antecedent to the consequent. The consequent itself is another implication. So the parentheses are necessary to group the inner implication properly. Without parentheses, it might be ambiguous, but with them, it's clear that the entire Lc \u2192 Lb is the consequent of the main implication.\n\nSo the final formula should be: \u00acR(b, b) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 Lb)\n</think>\n\n\u00acR(b,b)\u2192(Lc\u2192Lb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The first part is \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\" The second part is \"it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.\" The conjunction here is \"but,\" which is logically equivalent to \"and,\" so I'll need to connect the two parts with a conjunction.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\" In predicate logic, \"all A are B\" is usually translated as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). So \"Not all A are B\" would be the negation of that, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Ax \u2227 \u00acBx) by moving the negation inside using quantifier negation rules. Let me check which form is more appropriate here.\n\nThe original statement is \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\" Using the abbreviations, M is \"[1] is a tove\" and Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2].\" So \"all toves galumphed over Zindle\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). Therefore, \"Not all...\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). Alternatively, \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). Either form is correct, but maybe the problem expects the first form with the negation outside the universal quantifier. But I need to make sure.\n\nThe second part is \"it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.\" Rafin is represented by abbreviation b, and M is being a tove. So this would be \u00acMb.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is the conjunction of these two parts. So the formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2227 \u00acMb.\n\nWait, but maybe the first part can be written as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). Either way is correct. However, the example given in the problem uses the universal quantifier with implication. For instance, in the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So if the original sentence is \"Not all...\", then the correct translation would be the negation of that universal statement. So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) is correct. However, sometimes people prefer to use the existential quantifier. But since the example uses the universal, maybe I should stick with the negation of the universal here.\n\nSo the first part is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). The second part is \u00acMb. Then combine them with \u2227. Therefore, the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2227 \u00acMb.\n\nLet me check again. The original sentence: \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is equivalent to saying \"There exists at least one tove that did not galumph over Zindle.\" Which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). So both forms are equivalent. But the example uses the universal form. Which one should I use here? The problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations don't affect the structure here. The example uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), so maybe the expected answer for \"Not all...\" would be the negation of that universal. Therefore, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). However, in formal logic, sometimes the existential is preferred for such statements. But since the example uses the universal, perhaps the problem expects the negation of the universal here. Let me think again. The problem says to return a single well-formed formula in standard predicate logic syntax. Both forms are standard, but perhaps the problem expects the first approach. However, maybe the problem expects the existential. Wait, in the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So \"Not every linguist admires Charlie\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). But that's equivalent to \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). However, which form is more standard? It depends on the convention, but since the example uses the universal, perhaps the problem expects the negation of the universal here. However, I need to make sure that the formula is well-formed. Let me write both possibilities and see.\n\nOption 1: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2227 \u00acMb\n\nOption 2: \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2227 \u00acMb\n\nWhich one is correct? Both are logically equivalent. But since the example uses the universal quantifier, maybe the problem expects the negation of the universal. However, sometimes in formal logic, when you have a negation of a universal, it's more direct to use the existential. But the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so both are acceptable. However, the example uses the universal, so perhaps the problem expects the negation of the universal here. Let me check the original sentence again. The sentence says \"Not all toves...\", which is a negation of \"All toves...\". Since \"All toves...\" is translated with a universal, then \"Not all...\" is the negation of that. So the correct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). Therefore, I think that's the way to go here.\n\nSo the final formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2227 \u00acMb.\n\nYes, that's the correct translation. Let me make sure that I didn't miss any other parts. The second part is straightforward: \"it is not the case that Rafin is a tove\" is \u00acMb. The conjunction is \"but,\" which is just logical AND. So combining them with \u2227 is correct. So the final answer should be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2227 \u00acMb.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxa) \u2227 \u00acMb",

So, the sentence is \"Not all toves will burble or not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" And I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. It's a disjunction (\"or\") of two parts: \"Not all toves will burble\" and \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" So I need to translate each part separately and then combine them with a logical OR (\u2228).\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all toves will burble.\" In predicate logic, \"all toves will burble\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx), where Mx is \"x is a tove\" and Gx is \"x will burble.\" But since it's \"not all,\" that becomes the negation of that universal statement. The negation of \u2200x(A\u2192B) is \u2203x(A \u2227 \u00acB). So \"Not all toves will burble\" should be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx).\n\nNow the second part: \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" Similarly, \"all raths chortled at Bungo\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 P(x,c)), since Ox is \"x is a rath\" and P(x,c) is \"x chortled at Bungo\" (with c being Bungo). The negation of that universal statement would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acP(x,c)).\n\nPutting it all together, the original sentence is the disjunction of these two negated universals. So the entire formula should be (\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx)) \u2228 (\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acP(x,c))). \n\nWait, but I need to make sure the quantifiers are correctly scoped. Each existential quantifier applies to its own part of the disjunction. So the structure is correct as written. Also, the variables in each existential can use the same variable name (like x), since they're separate quantifiers. Even though they're both using x, they are separate existentials, so it's okay.\n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations. M is for tove, G for will burble. O is rath, P is chortled at [2], which here is Bungo (c). Yes, that's correct. So the translation looks right. The original sentence is an \"or\" between two \"not all\" statements, which each become an existential of the negation. So combining them with \u2228 gives the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n(\u2203x(Mx\u2227\u00acGx))\u2228(\u2203x(Ox\u2227\u00acPxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is: \"No toves chortled at Rafin and every borogove is uffish.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break it down into two parts because there's a conjunction (\"and\") connecting two separate statements. The first part is \"No toves chortled at Rafin,\" and the second part is \"every borogove is uffish.\" I'll handle each part separately and then combine them with the logical conjunction symbol \u2227.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"[1] is a tove,\" P for \"[1] chortled at [2],\" and b for \"Rafin.\" So, \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" means that there does not exist any tove that chortled at Rafin. In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" can be expressed as \u00ac\u2203x(Ax \u2227 Bx). Here, A is being a tove (Mx) and B is chortling at Rafin (Pxb). So the first part should be \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Pxb).\n\nNow the second part: \"Every borogove is uffish.\" The abbreviations here are N for \"[1] is a borogove\" and K for \"[1] is uffish.\" The standard way to translate \"All A are B\" is \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). So substituting, it becomes \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Kx).\n\nPutting both parts together with the conjunction \u2227, the entire formula should be \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Pxb) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Kx). \n\nWait, I need to check if the quantifiers are correctly used. The first part uses an existential quantifier negated, which correctly captures \"no toves.\" The second part uses a universal quantifier for \"every borogove.\" The variables are properly bound, and since the two parts of the conjunction don't share variables, there's no conflict. Also, the constants are correctly applied: b is Rafin, so Pxb means \"x chortled at Rafin.\" \n\nI think that's all. Let me just write it out again to make sure: the negation of the existence of x where Mx and Pxb, and for all x, if Nx then Kx. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Pxb) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Kx)",

I need to translate the sentence \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Bungo if and only if not all toves gimbled.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a biconditional (if and only if) between two parts. The left part is \"Zindle didn't snicker-snack Bungo,\" and the right part is \"not all toves gimbled.\"\n\nStarting with the left part: \"Zindle didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\" The abbreviation R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], so Zindle is [1], which is 'a', and Bungo is [2], which is 'c'. So the statement \"Zindle snicker-snacked Bungo\" would be R(a, c). But since it's negated, it becomes \u00acRac.\n\nNow the right part: \"not all toves gimbled.\" The abbreviation M is [1] is a tove, and I is [1] gimbled. \"All toves gimbled\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Ix). So \"not all toves gimbled\" is the negation of that, which is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Ix). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acIx), but the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax. Since the original is \"not all...\", it's better to write \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Ix).\n\nPutting it all together with the biconditional (\u2194), the entire formula should be \u00acRac \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). \n\nWait, but the sentence says \"if and only if not all toves gimbled.\" So the right side is \"not all toves gimbled,\" which is indeed \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). So combining both parts, the entire formalization is \u00acRac \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). \n\nLet me check if there's a simpler way. The biconditional can also be written as the equivalence between the two negations. I don't think I need to convert the right side into the existential quantifier unless it's necessary. The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, and \u00ac\u2200x(...) is acceptable. \n\nYes, so the final formula should be \u00acRac \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix). \n\nI need to make sure I used the abbreviations correctly. R is for the snicker-snacked relation, so with a and c, that's correct. M is for toves, so Mx means x is a tove. I is gimbled, so Ix. So \"all toves gimbled\" is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). Negating that gives the \"not all...\" part. \n\nYes, I think that's right. So the answer should be \u00acRac \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix).\n</think>\n\n\u00acRac\u2194\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix)",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem. First, I need to parse the sentence: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and no borogoves will burble.\" The abbreviations provided are M for tove, R for snicker-snacked with [2], a for Zindle, N for borogove, and G for will burble. \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" The phrase \"Not all\" usually translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. So \"All toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa). But since it's \"Not all,\" that becomes \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa), but I should stick to the negation of the universal unless the problem specifies otherwise. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given and standard syntax. The original example used the universal with implication, so maybe the expected form here is \u00ac\u2200x(...).\n\nThen the second part: \"no borogoves will burble.\" \"No\" translates to the negation of an existential. So \"There exists a borogove that will burble\" is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx), so \"no borogoves\" is \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx). Which is equivalent to \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acGx). Again, similar to the example, using universal with implication might be preferred here.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is the conjunction of these two parts. So the entire formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx). \n\nWait, let me check if I got the connectives right. The original sentence is \"Not all toves...\" and \"no borogoves...\", so both are negative statements connected by \"and\". So yes, the conjunction of the two negated quantifiers. \n\nAlternatively, for the second part, using the universal quantifier form: \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acGx). So maybe the second part is better written as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acGx) instead of \u00ac\u2203x(...). Which is logically equivalent. But which form is expected here? The example used universal for \"Every linguist...\", so perhaps for \"no borogoves will burble,\" which is a universal statement (all borogoves will not burble), using \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acGx) is more in line with the example's style. \n\nTherefore, the second part should be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acGx). Then the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nLet me confirm. The original sentence is \"Not all toves...\" which is the negation of a universal, so \u00ac\u2200x(...). Then \"no borogoves will burble\" is equivalent to \"all borogoves will not burble,\" which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acGx). Yes, that seems right. \n\nSo combining both parts with \u2227, the final formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nI should make sure there are no other interpretations. For example, does \"Not all toves...\" mean that there exists at least one tove that didn't snicker-snack Zindle? Which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa). But since the example used universal with implication, maybe the negation of the universal is acceptable here. However, in formal logic, \u00ac\u2200x(P\u2192Q) is equivalent to \u2203x(P \u2227 \u00acQ). But the problem says to return a well-formed formula in standard syntax. Either form is correct, but perhaps the problem expects the negation of the universal directly, rather than converting it to an existential. \n\nThe example given was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the original had \"Not every linguist...\", it would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So I think that's the way to go here. So the first part is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa). \n\nTherefore, the entire translation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again. The sentence is two separate clauses connected by \"and\". The first is \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle,\" which is the negation of the universal statement. The second is \"no borogoves will burble,\" which is a universal negative, translated as a universal with material implication. Yes. So the final formula is the conjunction of these two.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa)\u2227\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acGx)",

I need to translate the sentence \"Every borogove gyred just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure seems to be \"Every borogove gyred just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" The phrase \"just in case\" is a bit tricky. In logic, \"just in case\" is often used to mean \"if and only if,\" so that's a biconditional (\u2194). So the whole sentence is saying that for all borogoves, they gyred if and only if it's not the case that there exists a tove that snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The original sentence says \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" So \"no toves\" would translate to \"it is not the case that there exists a tove that snicker-snacked Zindle.\" So that would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rx a), where Mx is \"x is a tove\" and Rx a is \"x snicker-snacked Zindle\" (since a is Zindle).\n\nThen the left side of the biconditional is \"Every borogove gyred,\" which would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Hx). Because N is \"[1] is a borogove\" and H is \"[1] gyred.\"\n\nPutting it together, the entire formula should be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Hx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rx a). \n\nWait, but in the example given, they used the arrow for \"if...then.\" But here, the \"just in case\" is a biconditional. So the example sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which became \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). Here, the structure is different because it's a biconditional between two statements. \n\nSo the main connective is \u2194 between the universal statement about borogoves and the negation of the existential statement about toves. \n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations. The abbreviations given are:\n\nN: [1] is a borogove\nH: [1] gyred\nM: [1] is a tove\nR: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\na: Zindle\n\nSo \"Every borogove gyred\" is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Hx). \n\n\"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa). Because for all toves x, x did not snicker-snack Zindle would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acRxa), which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa). Either form is acceptable, but since the sentence uses \"no toves,\" maybe the existential with negation is better here. \n\nSo the entire formula is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Hx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa). \n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers are correctly placed and that the connectives are properly used. The biconditional connects the two parts. \n\nAnother way to think about \"just in case\" is that it's the condition for the first part. So \"A just in case B\" is A \u2194 B. So that's correct here. \n\nSo the final formula should be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Hx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Rxa). \n\nI need to make sure there's no free variables. All variables are bound by quantifiers. The 'a' is a constant, so that's fine. \n\nYes, this seems correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Hx)\u2194\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Rxa)",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence starts with \"Every tove...\" which suggests a universal quantifier. The abbreviation M is \"[1] is a tove\", so I'll probably use \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ...). \n\nNext, the main verb is \"chortled at Bungo\". The abbreviation P is \"[1] chortled at [2]\", and c is Bungo. So for a tove x, Pxc would mean x chortled at Bungo. \n\nBut the sentence says \"only if Zindle is mimsy.\" The structure here is \"A only if B\", which in logic translates to A \u2192 B. So the entire structure would be: For all x, if x is a tove, then (if Pxc then J a). Wait, because \"only if\" introduces the consequent. Let me confirm: \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So here, the whole \"Every tove chortled at Bungo\" is the A part, which would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc), but actually no. Wait, the original sentence is \"Every tove chortled at Bungo only if Zindle is mimsy.\" So the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"Every tove chortled...\" as the antecedent. Wait, no, maybe it's structured as: For every tove, if they chortled at Bungo, then Zindle is mimsy. Because \"only if\" usually connects two propositions. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal sentence: Every tove [chortled at Bungo] only if [Zindle is mimsy]. So the \"only if\" is connecting the action (chortling) with the condition (Zindle being mimsy). So for each tove, if they chortled at Bungo, then Zindle must be mimsy. So the structure is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 J a)). Because \"Every tove\" is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ...), and inside that, the chortling (Pxc) only if Ja. So \"only if\" becomes an implication where the antecedent is Pxc and the consequent is Ja. \n\nWait, but \"only if\" reverses the direction. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So if the sentence is \"A only if B\", then A is the subject part and B is the condition. Here, A is \"Every tove chortled at Bungo\", but since we're quantifying over toves, it's for each tove x, if x chortled at Bungo, then Ja. So combining that, the formula would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 Ja)). \n\nIs there any possibility that the quantifier applies differently? Let me check. The sentence says \"Every tove chortled at Bungo only if Zindle is mimsy.\" So it's saying that for every tove, if they did chortle at Bungo, then Zindle is mimsy. So yes, the implication is that whenever a tove chortles at Bungo, Ja must hold. \n\nSo the formalization would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 Ja)). Alternatively, since implications can be associated, this can also be written as \u2200x ((Mx \u2227 Pxc) \u2192 Ja). But the first way uses the universal quantifier followed by an implication. Both are logically equivalent because (A \u2192 (B \u2192 C)) is equivalent to ((A \u2227 B) \u2192 C). However, the original structure uses \"Every tove...\", which is a universal quantifier over Mx, so the first approach is more direct. \n\nBut let me check if the problem expects a certain structure. The example given was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So in that case, the universal quantifier applies to the subject (linguist) leading to the predicate (admirer of Charlie). Here, the structure is similar but with an additional condition. \n\nSo the original sentence can be rephrased as: For all x, if x is a tove, then (if x chortled at Bungo, then Zindle is mimsy). Which is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 Ja)). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 Ja)). \n\nLet me check for possible errors. Are there any other interpretations? Suppose someone might think that \"only if\" applies to the entire universal statement. Like, \"Every tove chortled at Bungo\" is true only if \"Zindle is mimsy\". In that case, it would be ( \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) ) \u2192 Ja. But that would mean that if all toves chortled at Bungo, then Zindle is mimsy. But the original sentence is \"Every tove chortled at Bungo only if Zindle is mimsy.\" Which sounds more like each individual chortle is conditional on Zindle being mimsy. For example, if Zindle isn't mimsy, then no tove chortled at Bungo. Which is captured by \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 Ja)), which is equivalent to \u2200x (\u00acJa \u2192 \u00ac(Mx \u2227 Pxc)), meaning if Zindle isn't mimsy, then no tove chortled at Bungo. Whereas the other interpretation (the universal implication) would allow that even if Zindle isn't mimsy, some toves might chortle and others not, as long as not all do. But the original sentence seems to say that for each tove, their chortling depends on Zindle being mimsy. Hence, the first approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 Ja)). Alternatively, using the example's style, it's similar to having a universal quantifier with an implication leading to the conditional based on Ja. \n\nSo the final formula is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 Ja)).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192(Pxc\u2192Ja))",

The sentence is: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case not all toves gyred.\" The abbreviations given are M for being a tove, R for snicker-snacked (with the second argument being the object, so Zindle here is 'a'), H for gyred. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The structure seems a bit complex because of the \"just in case\" part. I remember that \"just in case\" in logic usually translates to a biconditional (\u2194), meaning that the two parts are equivalent. So the whole sentence is saying that \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" if and only if \"Not all toves gyred.\" \n\nBreaking it down: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is the first part. In predicate logic, \"Not all\" is equivalent to \"There exists at least one that does not.\" So \"Not all toves R a\" would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa). Wait, because \"all toves R a\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa), so the negation would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa). \n\nSimilarly, \"Not all toves gyred\" would be \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acHy). \n\nSo the entire sentence is saying these two existentials are equivalent. Therefore, the formula should be (\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa)) \u2194 (\u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acHy)). \n\nBut wait, since the variables x and y are bound, they can be the same variable name because they're in separate scopes. So maybe it's better to write \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2194 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acHx). But in formal logic, using different variables isn't necessary here because the existentials are separate. However, since they are different quantifiers, using the same variable is allowed as long as they're in different scopes. \n\nSo combining them, the entire formula would be the biconditional between the two negated universals. Therefore, the final formula should be:\n\n(\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa)) \u2194 (\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acHx))\n\nAlternatively, since the order of the biconditional doesn't matter, it's the same as the other way around. Let me check again the original sentence: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case not all toves gyred.\" So the structure is A just in case B, which is A \u2194 B. So A is \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\", B is \"Not all toves gyred.\" So yes, the biconditional between the two.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me make sure there are no other parts. The abbreviations are correctly applied: M for tove, R for snicker-snacked with the second argument as Zindle (a), H for gyred. \n\nSo the formalization should be the biconditional of the two existential statements. I think that's right. So the final formula is as above.\n</think>\n\n(\u2203x(Mx\u2227\u00acRxa))\u2194(\u2203x(Mx\u2227\u00acHx))",

The sentence is \"Every rath gimbled or a borogove is mimsy.\" Hmm, need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The structure seems a bit tricky. The main parts are \"Every rath gimbled\" and \"a borogove is mimsy.\" The \"or\" connects these two parts. Wait, but how exactly? Is it that for every rath, either it gimbled or there exists a borogove that is mimsy? Or is there another way to interpret it?\n\nLet me think. The original sentence is a bit ambiguous. But in formal logic, we need to capture the intended meaning. Let's break it down. The first part is \"Every rath gimbled,\" which would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Ix). The second part is \"a borogove is mimsy,\" which sounds like \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Jy). The \"or\" between them would be a logical disjunction. But since the entire sentence is \"Every rath gimbled OR a borogove is mimsy,\" the correct structure would be that either all raths gimble, or there exists at least one borogove that is mimsy. So combining those two statements with a disjunction.\n\nSo the formalization would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2228 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Jy). Let me check the abbreviations again. O is [1] is a rath, I is [1] gimbled. So for every x, if Ox then Ix. Then N is [1] is a borogove, J is [1] is mimsy. So the second part is there exists a y such that Ny and Jy. The \"or\" is just \u2228 between the two. That seems right. I don't think there's a need for any other quantifiers or connectives. Let me make sure there's no ambiguity. The original sentence is structured as \"Every A B or a C is D.\" So yes, the two parts are separate, connected by OR. So the correct formalization is the disjunction of the two statements.

The abbreviations are M for \"[1] is a tove\" and G for \"[1] will burble\". \n\nFirst, the sentence is saying that there are no toves that will burble. In other words, if something is a tove, then it will not burble. So maybe I can use a universal quantifier here. Like for all x, if Mx (x is a tove), then not Gx (x will not burble). That would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about \"no toves will burble\" is that there does not exist a tove that burbles. So that would be \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). Both approaches should be equivalent. Which one is more appropriate here?\n\nThe original example used a universal quantifier with an implication. For \"Every linguist admires Charlie\", they used \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). Similarly, for \"No toves will burble\", using a universal quantifier making the statement that all toves do not burble. So that would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nBut let me check. If I use the existential approach, \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx), that's also correct. However, maybe the expected answer is the universal form. Let me think about which is more standard. Both are logically equivalent because in classical logic, \u2200x(P \u2192 \u00acQ) is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x(P \u2227 Q). So either form is acceptable. \n\nBut looking back at the example given, they used a universal quantifier for a universal statement. Since \"No S are P\" is traditionally translated as a universal statement. For example, \"No S is P\" is equivalent to \"All S are not P\". So in this case, \"All toves will not burble\", which would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct formalization here is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The abbreviations are M for tove and G for will burble. So yes, if x is a tove, then it does not burble.

The sentence is: \"If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath is mimsy only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. The main conditional is \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the original sentence says \"then every rath is mimsy only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo.\" So the \"only if\" is part of the consequent of the main conditional. So the structure is: If A, then (B only if C). \n\nIn logic, \"P only if Q\" is usually translated as P \u2192 Q. So the whole consequent would be (B \u2192 C). Let me check that again. If the consequent is \"every rath is mimsy only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo,\" then that's equivalent to saying that if every rath is mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Bungo. So the consequent would be (\u2200rath J) \u2192 Qcc (since Q is [1] galumphed over [2], and Bungo is c, so Qcc).\n\nNow, breaking down each part. \n\nThe antecedent of the main conditional is \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\" The abbreviations given are N for [1] is a borogove, R for [1] snicker-snacked [2], and b is Rafin. So \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). Because there exists some x that is a borogove (Nx) and x snicker-snacked Rafin (Rxb). \n\nThen the main conditional is: If \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb), then [consequent]. \n\nThe consequent is \"every rath is mimsy only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo.\" As discussed, this is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 Qcc. \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula would be:\n\n(\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, we need to make sure the quantifiers are properly scoped. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the consequent of the main implication is a material implication itself. So the entire structure is:\n\nIf A, then (B \u2192 C), which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). \n\nBut in logic, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. However, the original wording uses \"only if\" which directly translates to implication. So the correct way is to keep it as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). \n\nNow, let's verify the abbreviations again. \n\n- N: [1] is a borogove\n- R: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\n- b: Rafin\n- O: [1] is a rath\n- J: [1] is mimsy\n- Q: [1] galumphed over [2]\n- c: Bungo\n\nSo Qcc would be \"Bungo galumphed over Bungo\".\n\nPutting it all together, the formalization should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nBut we need to make sure that variables are properly named. Since in the antecedent, the existential quantifier uses x, but in the consequent, there's a universal quantifier. However, since the variables are bound within their own scope, using x again in the consequent is okay. But to avoid confusion, maybe the universal quantifier uses a different variable, but in logic, it's allowed as long as they are bound. For example, \u2203x P(x) \u2192 (\u2200x Q(x) \u2192 R) is acceptable because the x in \u2200x is a different bound variable.\n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nBut let me check if the original sentence's structure was correctly captured. The original says: If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath is mimsy only if Bungo galumphed over Bungo. \n\nYes, the main conditional is between the existence of a borogove doing an action and the implication that if all raths are mimsy, then Bungo did something. \n\nI think that's correct. So the final answer should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nBut let me check for any possible mistakes. For example, is there a need for parentheses? The standard syntax would require parentheses around the antecedent and the consequent. Also, the implication arrows need to be properly nested. \n\nYes, the entire structure is:\n\n[\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)] \u2192 [ ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 Qcc ]\n\nWhich is written as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nYes, that's correct. The inner implication is part of the consequent of the outer implication. \n\nI don't see any other issues. So the formalization should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 Qcc )",

The sentence is \"Every rath gimbled and Rafin gimbled.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. There are two parts connected by \"and\": \"Every rath gimbled\" and \"Rafin gimbled.\" \n\nFor the first part, \"Every rath gimbled,\" the abbreviation O represents \"[1] is a rath\" and I represents \"[1] gimbled.\" So, the standard way to express \"Every rath gimbled\" would be a universal quantifier. That would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Ix). Because for all x, if x is a rath (Ox), then x gimbled (Ix).\n\nThen the second part is \"Rafin gimbled.\" The abbreviation for Rafin is b, and since \"gimbled\" is I, this would be Ib. Because we're talking about Rafin (b) performing the action of gimbled.\n\nNow, the original sentence combines these two statements with \"and.\" In logic, \"and\" is represented by the conjunction symbol \u2227. So the entire formula should be the conjunction of the two parts. \n\nPutting it all together, the formalization should be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2227 Ib. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Are there any other possible interpretations? For example, does \"Every rath gimbled and Rafin gimbled\" imply that Rafin is a rath? The original sentence doesn't state that, so in the formalization, we shouldn't assume that. The second part is just a separate statement about Rafin gimbled, regardless of whether Rafin is a rath or not. So using Ib alone is correct here. \n\nAlso, the quantifier is only over the first part. The \"and\" connects two separate claims: one universal and one specific.

The sentence to formalize is \"Only borogoves are beamish and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"[1] is a borogove,\" L for \"[1] is beamish,\" P for \"[1] chortled at [2],\" with b as Rafin and c as Bungo.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"Only borogoves are beamish.\" The word \"only\" here is crucial. In logic, \"Only A are B\" translates to \"If something is B, then it must be A.\" So, if something is beamish (L), then it must be a borogove (N). That would be \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Nx). \n\nThe second part is \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\" Using the abbreviation P for chortled at, this would be \u00acPbc, since b is Rafin and c is Bungo. \n\nNow, combining these two parts with \"and,\" which is a logical conjunction (\u2227). So the entire formula should be \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Nx) \u2227 \u00acPbc. \n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the abbreviations correctly.

Also, the quantifier is universal because it's a general statement about all beamish things. \n\nWait, could there be another way to interpret \"Only borogoves are beamish\"? Let me double-check. \"Only A are B\" is equivalent to \"All B are A,\" which is indeed \u2200x(Bx \u2192 Ax). So here, since B is beamish (L) and A is borogove (N), that's exactly what I have. \n\nNo issues there.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is: \"Every tove is uffish unless every tove galumphed over Rafin.\" The abbreviations given are M for being a tove, K for being uffish, Q for galumphing over, and b is Rafin.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure of the sentence. The main structure is \"Every tove is uffish unless every tove galumphed over Rafin.\" The word \"unless\" can be tricky in logic. I remember that \"A unless B\" typically translates to \"If not B, then A,\" or equivalently, \"A \u2228 B.\" But here, the \"A\" is \"Every tove is uffish\" and the \"B\" is \"Every tove galumphed over Rafin.\"\n\nSo, breaking it down: The original statement can be rephrased as \"If it is not the case that every tove galumphed over Rafin, then every tove is uffish.\" Alternatively, using the equivalence of \"A unless B\" as \"A \u2228 B,\" but since both A and B are universal statements, I need to check which makes more sense.\n\nLet me think. If we take \"Every tove is uffish unless every tove galumphed over Rafin,\" the \"unless\" here is connecting two universal statements. So, maybe the correct way is to say that for all toves x, Kx holds unless for all toves y, Qy over b holds. Wait, but the \"unless\" here is at the level of the entire universal statements. So the whole \"Every tove is uffish\" is the A, and \"every tove galumphed over Rafin\" is B. So \"A unless B\" would be \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" So the entire formula would be \u00ac(\u2200y (My \u2192 Qyb)) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). But maybe there's another way to structure it.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that for each tove x, Kx is true unless \u2200y (My \u2192 Qyb)? So for each x, if \u2200y (My \u2192 Qyb) is false, then Kx must be true. Which would lead to \u2200x [ (Mx \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qyb) \u2192 Kx)) ]? But that seems more complicated. However, the original sentence is about the entire universal statements, not per individual. Let me check.\n\nOriginal sentence: \"Every tove is uffish unless every tove galumphed over Rafin.\" So the \"unless\" is between two universal statements. So the correct translation would be that either every tove is uffish, or every tove galumphed over Rafin. Wait, but \"A unless B\" is equivalent to A \u2228 B. But here, A is \"every tove is uffish\" and B is \"every tove galumphed over Rafin.\" So the entire statement would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u2200y(My\u2192Qyb). However, sometimes \"unless\" can be exclusive, but in logic, we usually take it as inclusive unless specified. So the translation would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb). But I need to confirm if that's the correct approach.\n\nBut another perspective: \"Unless\" can be translated as \"if not,\" so the statement is equivalent to \"If not every tove galumphed over Rafin, then every tove is uffish.\" Which would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb) \u2192 \u2200y(My\u2192Ky). Which is different from the disjunction. So which one is correct?\n\nLet me recall that in logic, \"A unless B\" is usually rendered as A \u2228 B. However, sometimes it's considered as \u00acB \u2192 A. These are logically equivalent because \u00acB \u2192 A is equivalent to B \u2228 A. So in this case, both approaches should be equivalent. However, when dealing with quantifiers, the structure might differ. Let me check:\n\nIf we take the \"unless\" as \u00acB \u2192 A, then B is \"every tove galumphed over Rafin,\" so \u00acB is \"it is not the case that every tove galumphed over Rafin,\" which would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). Therefore, the implication would be (\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb)) \u2192 \u2200y(My\u2192Ky). Alternatively, if we take the disjunction approach, it's \u2200y(My\u2192Ky) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb). Are these two equivalent?\n\nIn classical logic, the implication \u00acB \u2192 A is equivalent to B \u2228 A. However, when B and A are themselves universal statements, the equivalence between \u00acB \u2192 A and B \u2228 A holds. So in this case, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb) \u2192 \u2200y(My\u2192Ky) is equivalent to \u2200y(My\u2192Ky) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb). Therefore, both forms are acceptable. However, the problem says to use the standard predicate logic syntax. Which form is more standard?\n\nThe example given in the problem uses implication for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So perhaps using implication is preferred here. But for the \"unless\" case, since it's a compound statement, maybe using the implication form is better.\n\nBut let's think again. The original sentence is \"Every tove is uffish unless every tove galumphed over Rafin.\" So, if all toves galumphed over Rafin, then it's not necessary for them to be uffish. But if not all toves galumphed over Rafin, then all must be uffish. So the structure is: If it is not the case that all toves galumphed over Rafin, then all toves are uffish. Therefore, the formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb) \u2192 \u2200y(My\u2192Ky). \n\nAlternatively, the disjunction of the two universal statements: \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb). Both are logically equivalent. However, the problem may prefer one form over the other. Let me check the example again. The example uses implication in the conditional. But here, the \"unless\" is a conditional with a negation. \n\nBut in predicate logic, both forms are acceptable. However, since the problem asks for a single well-formed formula, either is acceptable. However, perhaps the expected answer is the implication form. Let me verify.\n\nAnother way to think: The \"unless\" is between two universal statements. So the translation could be that either all toves are uffish, or all toves galumphed over Rafin. So the disjunction of the two. But in that case, the formula would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb). However, the problem is that in natural language, \"A unless B\" sometimes implies that B is a sort of exception. But logically, both forms are equivalent. \n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the implication form. Let me see. Let's take the example again: \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" The formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). Now, if we have a sentence like \"Every A is B unless every A is C,\" how would that translate? It would be \u00ac(\u2200A are C) \u2192 (every A is B). Which is equivalent to \u2200A are B \u2228 \u2200A are C. \n\nBut in the problem, the answer could be either. However, the example uses implication. Let me check if there's a standard way. For example, \"P unless Q\" is usually translated as P \u2228 Q. However, when P and Q are themselves quantified statements, the same applies. So the correct translation would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb). However, another approach is to use the implication. \n\nBut let me think about the structure. The original sentence is \"Every tove is uffish unless every tove galumphed over Rafin.\" So, if the second part is true (every tove galumphed over Rafin), then the first part (every tove is uffish) may or may not be true. But if the second part is false, then the first must be true. So the implication is \u00ac(every tove galumphed over Rafin) \u2192 (every tove is uffish). Which would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb) \u2192 \u2200y(My\u2192Ky). \n\nBut how to write that? The antecedent is the negation of a universal statement, which becomes an existential statement. So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb) is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). Therefore, the implication becomes \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb) \u2192 \u2200y(My\u2192Ky). \n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations are M, K, Q, and b. So perhaps either form is acceptable, but which is more direct? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the disjunction of the two universal statements. However, in standard logic, \"A unless B\" is \u00acB \u2192 A, which is equivalent to B \u2228 A. So both are correct. However, since the example uses implication, maybe the expected answer is the implication form. \n\nBut the example is a simple universal statement. Let me think again. The example sentence is \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" The formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). If we had a sentence like \"Every linguist admires Charlie unless every linguist is a poet,\" perhaps the translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Px) \u2192 \u2200y(Ly\u2192Ryc), or equivalently \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) \u2228 \u2200x(Lx\u2192Px). \n\nBut in this problem, the user might expect the implication form. However, in the problem's example, the implication is used for the main connective. So perhaps for consistency, the answer should use implication. \n\nBut the problem is that the \"unless\" is connecting two universal statements. So the main connective is the implication. Therefore, the formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb) \u2192 \u2200y(My\u2192Ky). \n\nAlternatively, using the existential quantifier in the antecedent: \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb) \u2192 \u2200y(My\u2192Ky). But which is better? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are acceptable, but perhaps the first form is preferable because it directly negates the universal statement. \n\nSo, the final formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky). \n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Let's parse it: If it's not true that every tove galumphed over Rafin, then every tove is uffish. That matches the original sentence. \n\nAlternatively, the disjunction approach: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). Both forms are logically equivalent. \n\nBut which one does the problem expect? The example uses implication, so maybe the implication form is preferred here. However, since the example is a simple universal statement, perhaps the answer here is the implication form. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the formula is well-formed. Let's write it out:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 Ky)\n\nWhich in symbols would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\u2192\u2200y(My\u2192Ky). \n\nAlternatively, using the existential form:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb) \u2192 \u2200y(My\u2192Ky)\n\nBut both are equivalent. Which is better? The problem might prefer the form that directly uses the negation of the universal statement. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). \n\nBut I need to check if the variables are properly quantified. In the implication, the antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(...), and the consequent is \u2200y(...). Since variables are bound, it's okay. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx)\n\nWhich uses the same variable x in both parts, but since they are bound by different quantifiers, it's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, using different variables:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 Ky)\n\nBut both are correct. \n\nSo the correct formalization is the implication of the negation of the universal galumphing leading to the universal uffishness. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)",

The sentence is a conditional: \"If Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the components using the provided abbreviations. The antecedent is \"Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\" The abbreviation for snicker-snacking is R, which takes two arguments. Since both the subject and object are Rafin, that would be R(b, b), because 'b' stands for Rafin.\n\nNow the consequent is \"not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\" The negation of a universal quantifier usually translates to an existential quantifier with a negated predicate. So \"not all N galumphed over c\" would be \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Q(x, c)). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acQ(x, c)). But the original statement is in the form of \"not all,\" so sticking with the negation of the universal might be more direct here.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire conditional would be R(b, b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Q(x, c)). Let me double-check the abbreviations: N is \"[1] is a borogove,\" Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2],\" and c is Bungo.

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The main structure is a conditional statement: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves chortled at Bungo.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the first part of the conditional: \"not all borogoves are mimsy.\" In predicate logic, \"all A are B\" is usually translated as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)). So the negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x (N(x) \u2192 J(x)). Alternatively, using the quantifier negation rule, that's equivalent to \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 \u00acJ(x)). But since the original uses \"not all,\" I think the first form is more direct here. So the antecedent of the main conditional is \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx).\n\nNow the consequent is a bit trickier: \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves chortled at Bungo.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be confusing. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the structure is: \u00acR(b, b) only if \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Py(c)). Wait, let me check. The original says \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves chortled at Bungo.\" So the \"A only if B\" structure applies here. So A is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin\" (i.e., \u00acR(b, b)), and B is \"not all toves chortled at Bungo,\" which is \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Py(c)). \n\nPutting that together, the consequent is \u00acR(b, b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Py(c)). However, the original sentence says \"then [this consequent].\" So the entire main conditional is: \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [\u00acR(b, b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Py(c))]. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the \"only if\" part. Let me recall that \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So if the consequent is \"A only if B,\" then that part is A \u2192 B. So in this case, the consequent is (\u00acR(b, b)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 P(y, c))). \n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acR(b, b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 P(y, c)))\n\nBut I need to check if there's any other part I might have misread. Let me go through the original sentence again:\n\n\"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nYes, that's the structure. So the main connective is the implication from the antecedent (not all borogoves are mimsy) to the consequent (the \"only if\" statement). \n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations again to make sure I used them correctly:\n\n- N: [1] is a borogove\n- J: [1] is mimsy\n- R: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\n- b: Rafin\n- M: [1] is a tove\n- P: [1] chortled at [2]\n- c: Bungo\n\nYes, so \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin\" is \u00acR(b, b). \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is \u00ac\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 P(y, c)).\n\nPutting it all together, the formalization should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acR(b, b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 P(y, c)))\n\nAlternatively, we can write it using the same variable names and symbols as per the instructions. Also, need to make sure the quantifiers are correctly placed and the connectives are properly ordered. Since the consequent is an implication, the parentheses are necessary to group it correctly.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check for any possible mistakes. For example, maybe I should convert the \"not all\" into an existential? But the problem allows using the negation of the universal quantifier, which is acceptable in predicate logic. So \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) is fine. Similarly for \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Py(c)).\n\nYes, this seems to be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acRbb\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Py(c)))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is: \"A borogove galumphed over Rafin unless every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" And we have to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The structure here is \"A borogove galumphed over Rafin unless every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" The word \"unless\" is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A unless B\" usually translates to \"A \u2228 B\" or sometimes \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Wait, but I need to be careful here. Let me recall: \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"if not B, then A\", and also \"A or B\". So depending on context, either could work. But here, since the sentence is saying that either there's a borogove that galumphed over Rafin, or every borogove chortled at Bungo. So the main connective would be a disjunction between the two parts.\n\nLet me break down each part. The first part is \"A borogove galumphed over Rafin.\" Using the abbreviations, N is \"[1] is a borogove\", Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", and b is Rafin. So this part would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Qxb). Wait, because there exists some x that is a borogove (Nx) and x galumphed over b (Rafin). \n\nThe second part is \"every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" The abbreviation for chortled is P: \"[1] chortled at [2]\", and c is Bungo. So this would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc). Because for all x, if x is a borogove (Nx), then x chortled at c (Bungo).\n\nNow the original sentence is \"A borogove galumphed over Rafin unless [every borogove chortled at Bungo].\" So using the \"unless\" structure, this would be the first part OR the second part. But I need to check if \"unless\" here is exclusive or inclusive. But in logic, unless typically is inclusive. However, the way the sentence is phrased, it might be that if the second part is false, then the first must be true. So maybe it's better to represent it as \u00ac(second part) \u2192 first part. Wait, but the user might expect \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B. Let me think again. \n\nIn logic, \"A unless B\" is often translated as A \u2228 B. For example, \"I will go unless it rains\" becomes \"I go \u2228 it rains\". But sometimes people might model it as \u00acB \u2192 A. However, both are equivalent because A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. So in this case, since the sentence is structured as \"A unless B\", I can choose either form. But the question is about which form is more standard here. Let's check the example given in the problem. \n\nThe example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" The formalization was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they used implication for the universal. So for the \"unless\", perhaps using the disjunction is better. Let me go with the disjunction. \n\nSo putting it together, the entire formula would be (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Qxb)) \u2228 (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc)). But wait, is there a possibility that both could be true? Well, \"unless\" can sometimes imply that they are mutually exclusive, but in logic, unless is just logical OR. So the correct formalization would be the disjunction of the two. \n\nWait, but sometimes in English, \"unless\" can be a bit ambiguous. Let me check another example. Suppose \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A or B\". For instance, \"I will go unless it rains\" means \"I will go or it rains\". But in this case, the original sentence is \"A borogove galumphed over Rafin unless every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" So that would translate to \"There exists a borogove that galumphed over Rafin OR every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" Which is exactly the disjunction between the two parts. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Qxb) \u2228 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc). \n\nBut let me check if I need to use any parentheses. Since the connective is \u2228, and the two parts are separate formulas, I need to parenthesize each. So yes, the entire formula is (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Qxb)) \u2228 (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)). \n\nNow, checking the abbreviations again: N is for borogove, Q is galumphed over, b is Rafin, P is chortled at, c is Bungo. All correct. \n\nI think that's the right approach. So the final formula is the disjunction of the two parts. Let me write that out.\n</think>\n\n(\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Qxb) \u2228 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The sentence is a bit confusing: \"Every tove chortled at every rath that chortled at every rath.\" Hmm. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the main structure is \"Every tove chortled at every rath...\" So for every tove, and for every rath, there's some action. But then there's a relative clause: \"that chortled at every rath.\" So the rath in question must be one that chortled at every rath. Wait, that seems recursive. A rath that chortled at every rath, including itself maybe?\n\nLet me parse it step by step. The subject is \"Every tove.\" The verb is \"chortled at every rath\" that satisfies a condition. The condition is \"that chortled at every rath.\" So the structure is like: For every tove, and for every rath (let's call it y) such that y chortled at every rath, then the tove chortled at y.\n\nSo translating to predicate logic:\n\nFirst, for all x, if x is a tove (Mx), then for all y, if y is a rath (Oy) and for all z, if z is a rath (Oz), then y chortled at z (Pyz), then the tove x chortled at y (Pxy).\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2227 \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Pyz) \u2192 Pxy))\n\nWait, but the original sentence says \"every rath that chortled at every rath.\" So the rath y must be such that y chortled at every rath. So that's \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Pyz). Then, for every such y, the tove x chortled at y. So the formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ( (Oy \u2227 \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Pyz)) \u2192 Pxy ))\n\nBut maybe the \"that\" clause modifies the rath, so the y must satisfy both being a rath and chortling at every rath. So the antecedent for the inner implication is Oy \u2227 \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Pyz), and the consequent is Pxy. Then, for all x and y, if x is a tove and y meets that condition, then Pxy.\n\nSo the entire formula is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ( (Oy \u2227 \u2200z (Oz \u2192 Pyz)) \u2192 Pxy )).\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again. The original sentence is \"Every tove chortled at every rath that chortled at every rath.\" So the structure is: All toves chortled at all raths which have the property of chortling at every rath. So yes, the formula should capture that. The quantifiers are universal for the toves and the raths in question. The nested part is the condition on the rath. So I think that's right.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u2200y((Oy\u2227\u2200z(Oz\u2192Pyz))\u2192Pxy))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the sentence we need to formalize is: \"If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"[1] is a tove\", Q for \"[1] galumphed over [2]\", a for Zindle, and c for Bungo.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If P, then (Q only if R). Let me break down each part.\n\nThe first part of the conditional is \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\" In predicate logic, \"all toves galumphed over Zindle\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx a). So \"not all\" would be the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx a). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQx a), since the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential with the negated implication. But maybe it's better to stick with the negation of the universal for consistency unless there's a reason to switch.\n\nThen the consequent is \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is that if Bungo galumphed over Zindle (Qc a), then it must be the case that not all toves galumphed over Bungo. \n\nSo \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" would be similar to the first part. The original \"all toves galumphed over Bungo\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c), so the negation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c), or equivalently \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQx c).\n\nPutting it all together, the consequent becomes Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c). Wait, but the original consequent is \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all...\", so that's Qc a only if \u00ac\u2200x(...), which translates to Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c).\n\nTherefore, the entire sentence is: If \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx a), then (Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c)).\n\nSo combining these, the formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx a) \u2192 (Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c))\n\nAlternatively, we can write the implications as they are without converting the negated universals. Let me check if there's any alternative way. But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard symbols. So I think this is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the structure is correct. Let me re-express the original sentence again. The main conditional is: If [not all toves galumphed over Zindle], then [Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if [not all toves galumphed over Bungo]]. \n\nYes, so the structure is correct. The antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx a), and the consequent is Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c). So the entire formula is the implication of these two.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any scope issues or quantifier placement? For example, in the consequent, the implication is between Qc a and the negated universal. That seems right.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nUsing the abbreviations a for Zindle and c for Bungo, so Q takes the arguments correctly. So yes, that's the structure.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxa)\u2192(Qca\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"Not all borogoves are beamish and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"[1] is a borogove\", L for \"[1] is beamish\", P for \"[1] chortled at [2]\", and c as \"Bungo\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into two parts connected by \"and\". The first part is \"Not all borogoves are beamish\", and the second part is \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\".\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all borogoves are beamish\". In predicate logic, \"All A are B\" is typically expressed as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)). So, the negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)). However, I remember that the negation of \"all\" can also be expressed as \"there exists at least one that is not\". So, \u00ac\u2200x (N(x) \u2192 L(x)) is equivalent to \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 \u00acL(x)). I need to decide which form to use. The original instruction says to use the abbreviations provided, so maybe I should stick with the negation of the universal quantifier here. But both forms are logically equivalent. However, since the problem says \"Not all...\", the direct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x (N(x) \u2192 L(x)).\n\nNow, the second part: \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\" Using the abbreviation P for \"[1] chortled at [2]\", this would be \u00acP(c, c), since both the subject and the object are Bungo (c).\n\nNow, combining both parts with \"and\". The logical connective for \"and\" is \u2227. So the entire formula would be \u00ac\u2200x (N(x) \u2192 L(x)) \u2227 \u00acP(c, c).\n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. The first part is \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" which is indeed the negation of \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 L(x)), so that's correct. The second part is straightforward. So the entire formula is the conjunction of those two parts.\n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the correct quantifiers and connectives. Also, check if there's any parentheses needed. The first part is \u00ac\u2200x (N(x) \u2192 L(x)), and then \u2227 \u00acP(c,c). The parentheses around the implication are necessary to properly bind the quantifier. So yes, the formula should be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Lx) \u2227 \u00acPcc.\n\nI think that's it. Let me write that out properly with the abbreviations as given. The variables are lowercase letters, so x is fine. The constants are c. So the final formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Lx) \u2227 \u00acPcc.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Lx) \u2227 \u00acPcc",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"Every tove is uffish unless not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"[1] is a tove\", K for \"[1] is uffish\", O for \"[1] is a rath\", P for \"[1] chortled at [2]\", and c is Bungo.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The main structure seems to be \"Every tove is uffish unless [condition].\" The condition here is \"not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" So, the \"unless\" is a logical operator that I need to translate correctly.\n\nIn logic, \"A unless B\" can be translated as \"A \u2228 B\", but sometimes it's also represented as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Wait, I need to recall the exact equivalence. Let me think. The statement \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"if not B, then A\", which would be \u00acB \u2192 A. Alternatively, it can also be phrased as A \u2228 B. But depending on the context, sometimes it's exclusive. However, in formal logic, we usually use material implication or disjunction. So perhaps here, since we're dealing with universal quantifiers, it's better to use the implication form.\n\nSo breaking down the original sentence: \"Every tove is uffish unless not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" Let's rephrase this as \"If it is not the case that all raths chortled at Bungo, then every tove is uffish.\" Wait, no. The \"unless\" structure is A unless B, which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. So here, A is \"Every tove is uffish\" and B is \"not all raths chortled at Bungo\". Wait, no. Let me get this right. The original sentence is \"Every tove is uffish unless [not all raths chortled at Bungo].\" So the structure is A unless B, where A is \"Every tove is uffish\" and B is \"not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" So translating that would be \u00acB \u2192 A. So if B is \"not all raths chortled at Bungo\", then \u00acB is \"all raths chortled at Bungo\". Therefore, the implication is: If all raths chortled at Bungo, then every tove is uffish. Wait, but the original sentence says \"Every tove is uffish unless not all raths...\", which would mean that if it's not the case that all raths chortled at Bungo (i.e., B is true), then A is true. Wait, no. Let me think again. The \"unless\" can be a bit tricky. Let's recall that \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Let's take an example: \"I will go unless it rains.\" That means if it doesn't rain, I will go. So \u00acB (it doesn't rain) \u2192 A (I go). Alternatively, it's equivalent to A \u2228 B (I go or it rains). \n\nSo applying this to the problem. Let me define A as \"Every tove is uffish\" and B as \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" Then \"A unless B\" would be equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. So if B is false (i.e., all raths chortled at Bungo), then A must be true. Alternatively, it could be A \u2228 B. But in this case, since A is a universal statement and B is a negation of a universal, maybe it's easier to structure it as an implication.\n\nSo the main formula would be: If not B (i.e., all raths chortled at Bungo), then A (every tove is uffish). Therefore, the implication is \u00ac(not all raths chortled at Bungo) \u2192 (every tove is uffish). Wait, no. Let's clarify. Let me rephrase the original sentence: \"Every tove is uffish unless [not all raths chortled at Bungo].\" So the \"unless\" is separating two conditions. So it's saying that either every tove is uffish, or not all raths chortled at Bungo. Which would be A \u2228 B. But also equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to translate it as: (Every tove is uffish) \u2228 (not all raths chortled at Bungo). But how to formalize that.\n\nFirst, let's formalize \"Every tove is uffish.\" That would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx).\n\nNext, \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" The statement \"all raths chortled at Bungo\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Therefore, \"not all raths chortled at Bungo\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc).\n\nSo the original sentence is saying that either \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) is true, or \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) is true. Which would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, using the implication form, since \"A unless B\" is \u00acB \u2192 A, then if we take A as \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) and B as \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc), then the implication would be \u00acB \u2192 A. But \u00acB would be \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) which is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Therefore, the implication is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nSo which one is correct? Let's check. The original sentence is \"Every tove is uffish unless not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" So the \"unless\" is between the two parts. So it's like: A unless B, where A is \"Every tove is uffish\" and B is \"not all raths chortled at Bungo\". Therefore, according to the equivalence, this is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. Which would be: If all raths chortled at Bungo, then every tove is uffish. So the implication is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nAlternatively, the disjunction would be A \u2228 B, which is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Both forms are equivalent. However, in formal logic, implications are often preferred for clarity, especially when dealing with quantifiers.\n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. So either form is acceptable, but perhaps the implication form is better here. Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they use the implication. Therefore, perhaps the same approach here.\n\nBut let's make sure. Let me think again. The original sentence is saying that if the condition (not all raths chortled at Bungo) holds, then the \"every tove is uffish\" holds. Wait, no. Wait, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"if not B then A\". So if B is \"not all raths...\", then the negation of B is \"all raths...\". Therefore, the implication is: If all raths chortled at Bungo, then every tove is uffish. Which is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nAlternatively, if we take \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B, then we have \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Both are logically equivalent. However, the problem may expect one or the other. Let me check if there's a standard way to handle \"unless\" in such translations. \n\nIn logic, \"unless\" is typically translated as a disjunction. For example, \"A unless B\" becomes A \u2228 B. But sometimes, depending on context, it's considered as material implication. However, in this case, since the \"unless\" is connecting two statements (one universal and another about all raths), perhaps using the implication form is more straightforward. But let's see.\n\nLet me try both approaches.\n\nFirst approach (implication):\n\nThe formula would be: \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx)\n\nSimplify the antecedent: \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x ...) becomes \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). So the implication is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx).\n\nSecond approach (disjunction):\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)\n\nBoth are equivalent. Which one is preferred? The example uses implication for the universal statement. But the example is straightforward. However, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are acceptable, but perhaps the disjunction is more direct given the \"unless\".\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects a certain structure. The example uses implication for the universal quantifier. However, in the case of \"unless\", using disjunction might be more appropriate. Let me think of another example. Suppose the sentence is \"All A are B unless all C are D.\" Then translating that as (All A are B) \u2228 \u00ac(All C are D). Alternatively, as (All C are D) \u2192 (All A are B). Both are equivalent. So which one to choose? The problem says to return a well-formed formula. Either is acceptable, but perhaps the implication is better here because the \"unless\" is a conditional. \n\nBut the problem might prefer the disjunction. Let me think again. The original sentence is structured as \"Every tove is uffish unless [not all raths chortled at Bungo].\" So the \"unless\" is like an \"or\". So if we take that into account, then it's (Every tove is uffish) OR (not all raths chortled at Bungo). Which would be the disjunction. So that would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). \n\nBut in formal logic, sometimes people prefer to avoid having negations of quantifiers in the formula. However, the problem allows using the given abbreviations and standard symbols. Since \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) is equivalent to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc), perhaps we can rewrite the disjunction as \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc). But the problem says to use the abbreviations given, which include O, P, etc. So perhaps it's acceptable to have \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the implication form. Let me check the example again. The example had \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So when there's a universal statement, they use implication. But in this case, the \"unless\" introduces a disjunction. So perhaps the correct way is to use the disjunction. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me consider the meaning. The original sentence says that either every tove is uffish, or it's not the case that all raths chortled at Bungo. So if all raths did chortle, then every tove must be uffish. If even one rath didn't chortle, then the \"unless\" condition is satisfied, so the toves being uffish isn't required. Wait, no. If the \"unless\" is A unless B, then if B is true, then A might not be required. Wait, no. The structure is A unless B. So if B is true, then A might not hold. But if B is false, then A must hold. \n\nSo in our case, if \"not all raths chortled at Bungo\" (B is true), then the \"unless\" condition is satisfied, so the statement \"Every tove is uffish\" doesn't have to hold. Wait, no. Wait, the original sentence says \"Every tove is uffish unless not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" So if \"not all raths chortled at Bungo\" is true (i.e., B is true), then the \"unless\" clause is true, which would mean that the main clause (\"Every tove is uffish\") might not be required. Wait, no. The \"unless\" is like an exception. Let me think of it as \"A holds unless B holds\". So if B holds, then A might not hold. If B does not hold, then A must hold. Therefore, the correct translation is \u00acB \u2192 A. \n\nIn this case, A is \"Every tove is uffish\", B is \"not all raths chortled at Bungo\". Therefore, \u00acB is \"all raths chortled at Bungo\". Therefore, the implication is: if all raths chortled at Bungo, then every tove is uffish. So the formula would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nThis seems to capture the meaning correctly. Because if all raths did chortle, then the toves must be uffish. If not all did chortle, then the toves might or might not be uffish. \n\nAlternatively, using the disjunction, it would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Which is equivalent. \n\nBut which form is expected here? The example uses implication for the universal statement. However, in this case, the main connective is an implication between two universal statements. \n\nI think both are correct, but perhaps the problem expects the implication form. Let me check with an example. Suppose we have \"All A are B unless all C are D.\" Then translating as (All C are D) \u2192 (All A are B). That seems to make sense. Because if all C are D, then All A are B must hold. If not, then All A are B might not. \n\nIn our problem, the \"unless\" is between \"Every tove is uffish\" and \"not all raths chortled at Bungo\". So translating it as \u00ac(not all raths...) \u2192 every tove is uffish. Which is the same as all raths... \u2192 every tove is uffish. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nBut let me also check the disjunction approach. The disjunction would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Which is equivalent. However, in formal logic, implications are often preferred when there's a conditional relationship. Since the original sentence has a conditional structure (\"unless\"), using the implication might be more appropriate. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nBut wait, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Let me check the abbreviations again. \n\nAbbreviations:\n\nM: [1] is a tove\n\nK: [1] is uffish\n\nO: [1] is a rath\n\nP: [1] chortled at [2]\n\nc: Bungo\n\nSo yes, the formula uses these abbreviations correctly. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the order of the quantifiers. The antecedent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc), and the consequent is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). The variables in the antecedent and consequent are both universally quantified, but they use different x variables. However, in predicate logic, the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent are bound variables, so they can be reused. So the formula is well-formed. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the disjunction, then it would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). But I think the implication is better here. \n\nLet me verify with an example. Suppose all raths did chortle at Bungo. Then the antecedent is true, so the implication requires that every tove is uffish. If some raths did not chortle, then the antecedent is false, making the implication true regardless of the consequent. Which matches the original sentence's meaning. \n\nYes, this seems correct. So the final answer should be the implication form.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxc)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. \n\nFirst, the sentence is a conditional: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo galumphed over Zindle.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all borogoves are mimsy.\" In predicate logic, \"all borogoves are mimsy\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). The negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), meaning there's at least one borogove that isn't mimsy. But since the original is \"not all,\" I think using the negation of the universal quantifier is more direct here.\n\nNow the consequent: \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo galumphed over Zindle.\" The structure here is \"A only if B,\" which in logic translates to A \u2192 B. So the entire consequent should be a conditional where the antecedent is \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" and the consequent is \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle.\"\n\nBreaking down the antecedent of the consequent: \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\" The abbreviation for \"is a borogove\" is N, so we need to assert that there exists some x such that Nx (x is a borogove) and R(x, b) (since b is Rafin and R is [1] snicker-snacked [2]). So that part would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb).\n\nThe consequent of the consequent is \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle.\" Here, Q is [1] galumphed over [2], and c is Bungo, a is Zindle. So this would be Q(c, a), or Qca.\n\nPutting that together, the consequent of the main conditional is (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qca.\n\nWait, but the original says \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo galumphed...\" So the whole \"a borogove...\" part is the antecedent of the only if. So yes, the structure is (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qca.\n\nNow combining the antecedent and consequent. The entire statement is: If \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx), then [ (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qca ].\n\nSo the full formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [ (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qca ].\n\nBut let me check if there's a way to simplify or structure it correctly. Also, need to ensure that the quantifiers are properly scoped. The existential quantifier in the consequent is only inside the implication. Also, the main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nAnother thing to note: sometimes \"only if\" can be tricky. The structure \"A only if B\" is B is a necessary condition for A, so A \u2192 B. So if the statement is \"A only if B,\" then it's A \u2192 B. So in this case, the \"A\" is \"a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin,\" which is an existential statement. Therefore, the translation is correct as (\u2203x... ) \u2192 Qca.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 ( \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Also, need to make sure that the variables are properly bound. The existential quantifier in the consequent is only for x, which is fine.\n\nAlternatively, could we rephrase the antecedent? Since \u00ac\u2200x(...) is equivalent to \u2203x\u00ac(...), which would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). But the problem didn't specify whether to use the negation of the universal or the existential. Either is correct, but the original sentence is \"not all,\" which is more naturally expressed as \u00ac\u2200. However, sometimes in logic, it's preferable to push the negation inward, but the problem allows either as long as it's well-formed. The example given uses the universal with implication, so maybe the user expects the negation of the universal here. Let's stick with \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) as the antecedent.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 ( \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca )\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, implications have lower precedence than quantifiers and connectives, so parentheses are important here. Let me make sure the parentheses are correctly placed. The main implication is between the antecedent and the consequent. The consequent is itself an implication between the existential and Qca. So the structure is:\n\n(\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 ( (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qca )\n\nYes, that's correct. Now, in terms of writing it without unnecessary parentheses, but ensuring it's well-formed. Also, need to check if the variables are properly scoped. The x in the antecedent is bound by the universal, and the x in the consequent is bound by the existential. Since they are different quantifiers, they are separate variables, but in logic, variables can be reused as long as they are properly bound. However, in this case, the x in the antecedent is in a different scope than the x in the consequent. So it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final translation should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca)\n\nI think that's it. Let me double-check the abbreviations:\n\n- N: [1] is a borogove\n- J: [1] is mimsy\n- R: [1] snicker-snacked [2]\n- b: Rafin\n- Q: [1] galumphed over [2]\n- c: Bungo\n- a: Zindle\n\nYes, so Rxb is x snicker-snacked b (Rafin), and Qca is c (Bungo) galumphed over a (Zindle). All correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192Qca)",

That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"not all toves chortled at Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the \"A\" is \"not all toves chortled at Bungo,\" and \"B\" is \"every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" \n\nLet me rephrase the consequent. The original is: \"not all toves chortled at Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" So, the entire \"not all toves...\" is the antecedent of an implication where the consequent is \"every borogove...\". Wait, no, \"only if\" reverses that. So if we have \"A only if B\", that's A \u2192 B. So here, \"not all toves...\" (let's call this A) only if B (every borogove...). Therefore, A \u2192 B. \n\nBut what is A? \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo.\" The negation of \"all toves chortled at Bungo.\" The original \"all toves chortled at Bungo\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc), since M is being a tove and P is chortled at c (Bungo). So \"not all toves...\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc). But for the translation, maybe it's better to stick with the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nSo putting that together, the consequent is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc). Wait, but the original says \"only if every borogove...\", so the implication is that if not all toves chortled at Bungo, then it must be that every borogove did. Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive, but that's how \"only if\" works. So the structure is: (Not all M chortled at c) \u2192 (All N chortled at c). \n\nSo the entire consequent is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc). \n\nPutting it all together, the main conditional is \u00acRbb \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc)]. \n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, maybe I can write the consequent as (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc). \n\nSo the entire formula is \u00acRbb \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc)). \n\nAlternatively, using material implication equivalences, maybe we can rephrase. But the problem says to use standard symbols, so as long as the structure is correct. \n\nLet me check again. The original sentence: If A, then (B only if C). Which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Because \"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. So yes, the consequent is B \u2192 C where B is \u00ac\u2200x... and C is \u2200y... \n\nSo the final formula is \u00acRbb \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc)). \n\nNow, I need to make sure that all abbreviations are used correctly. R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], so Rbb is Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin. The negation is correct. M is being a tove, P is chortled at [2], so Pxc is x chortled at c (Bungo). Similarly, Ny is y is a borogove, and Pyc is y chortled at c. \n\nI think that's all. Let me write that in the formal syntax. Using the quantifiers and connectives as specified.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If Zindle gimbled, then...\" So the overall form is Ia \u2192 [something]. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the \"something\" part is \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" Let's parse that. \n\nThe phrase \"only if\" in logic usually translates to an implication where the consequent is the \"only if\" part. So \"A only if B\" becomes A \u2192 B. But here, the \"A\" is \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\" and \"B\" is \"every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nSo first, \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc), since O is [1] is a rath and R is [1] snicker-snacked [2], with c being Bungo.\n\nThen, \"every borogove chortled at Bungo\" is \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc), since N is [1] is a borogove and P is [1] chortled at [2], again with c as Bungo.\n\nPutting the \"only if\" together, the entire part becomes \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc). Wait, but \"only if\" in the original sentence is connecting the two universal statements. So the structure is: If Ia, then ( [\u2200rath R] \u2192 [\u2200borogove P] ). \n\nSo combining all parts, the entire formula should be Ia \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc) ). \n\nWait, but in logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if there's a way to simplify or structure it correctly. The main connective is the implication from Ia to the rest. The rest is an implication between the two universal statements. So the final formula would be:\n\nIa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc) )\n\nAlternatively, since the variables x and y are bound, we can use the same variable if they're not conflicting, but usually, different variables are used for clarity. Also, since the order of quantifiers doesn't matter here as they're in separate universals, but in this case, they are in different parts of the implication. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me verify again. The original sentence says that if Zindle gimbled, then whenever every rath snicker-snacks Bungo, it must be that every borogove chortled at Bungo. So yes, the implication is that the snicker-snacking by raths is a sufficient condition for the chortling by borogoves. Therefore, the formalization should capture that the entire \"every rath...\" implies the \"every borogove...\", and this whole implication is the consequent of the initial \"if Zindle gimbled.\"\n\nI don't see any other abbreviations needed here. All the terms are covered by the given abbreviations. So the final formula should be as above.\n</think>\n\nIa\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192\u2200y(Ny\u2192Pyc))",

The sentence is \"Every tove snicker-snacked a tove.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"[1] is a tove\" and R for \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. \"Every tove\" implies a universal quantifier. So for all x, if x is a tove, then something happens. The something is \"snicker-snacked a tove.\" \n\nNow, \"snicker-snacked a tove\" \u2013 the subject here is the same tove mentioned in the first part? Or is it another tove? The original sentence says \"Every tove snicker-snacked a tove.\" So each tove snicker-snacks some tove. So for every x that is a tove, there exists some y (which is a tove) such that x snicker-snacks y. \n\nSo breaking it down: For all x, if Mx (x is a tove), then there exists a y such that My (y is a tove) and Rxy (x snicker-snacks y). \n\nWait, but the original sentence says \"a tove\", which might imply that y is a tove. But since the abbreviation M is already \"[1] is a tove\", and the verb R is \"[1] snicker-snacked [2]\". So the structure would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2203y (My \u2227 Rxy)). \n\nIs that correct? Let me check. The original example had \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). Here, the structure is similar but with an existential quantifier for the second part. So instead of a specific constant like c, we have an existence. \n\nSo yes, the correct formalization should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2203y (My \u2227 Rxy)). That way, every tove x snicker-snacks some tove y. \n\nWait, could it be that the \"a tove\" is the same as x? Like, does each tove snicker-snack themselves? But the original sentence uses \"a tove\" which is indefinite, suggesting it's some tove, not necessarily the same one. So existential quantifier makes sense here. \n\nTherefore, the formula should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2203y (My \u2227 Rxy)).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u2203y(My\u2227Rxy))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. \n\nFirst, the main structure of the sentence is a conditional: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then [some statement].\" So the first part is the antecedent, and the consequent is the part after \"then.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all borogoves are mimsy.\" In predicate logic, \"all A are B\" is usually translated as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)). So the negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x (N(x) \u2192 J(x)). Alternatively, using the quantifier negation rule, that's equivalent to \u2203x \u00ac(N(x) \u2192 J(x)), but maybe the first form is clearer here. But I need to make sure I capture the correct negation. \n\nWait, the original says \"not all borogoves are mimsy,\" which is indeed the negation of \"all borogoves are mimsy.\" So the antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). \n\nNow the consequent is a bit trickier. The sentence says: \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" Let's parse this. \n\nThe phrase \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the \"A\" part is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin.\" Let me rephrase the whole consequent. The structure is: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then [\u00acR(b,b) only if \u2200rath Q(r, b)]\". \n\nBreaking down the consequent: \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" So \"only if\" here is a material implication. So \"\u00acR(b,b)\" is the antecedent of the implication, and \"\u2200rath Q(r, b)\" is the consequent. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is that \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin\" only if \"every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" So that would translate to \u00acR(b,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x, b)). \n\nWait, but the original wording is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if every rath...\" So \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So for \"A only if B,\" A can only be true if B is true. So that's A \u2192 B. So here, A is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin,\" which is \u00acR(b,b). B is \"every rath galumphed over Rafin,\" which is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x, b)). Therefore, the consequent is \u00acR(b,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x, b)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If [\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)], then [\u00acR(b,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x, b))]. \n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acR(b,b) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Q(x, b)))\n\nBut let me check if I need to handle the \"only if\" correctly. The original says \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if every rath...\" So the \"only if\" is between the two parts. So yes, the implication is that if the first part is true, then the second must be true. Hence, the implication direction is correct. \n\nAnother thing to check: the use of abbreviations. The abbreviations are N for borogove, J for mimsy, R for snicker-snacked, b for Rafin, O for rath, Q for galumphed over. So that's all correctly applied here. \n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qyb))\n\nWait, variables can be reused, but maybe using different variables for the two quantifiers. The first part uses x, and the second part, when translating \"every rath,\" uses another x. But in the consequent, the implication has a universal quantifier. Let me check variable capture. Suppose the outer quantifier is x in the antecedent. The consequent has a universal quantifier; perhaps using a different variable to avoid confusion. For example, in the consequent's universal quantifier, using y instead of x. But since variables are bound, it's okay to reuse them. However, in formal logic, variables can be renamed without changing the meaning. So maybe it's better to use different variables to avoid confusion. Let me adjust that. \n\nOriginal consequent: \u00acR(b,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x, b)). But if the antecedent of the main conditional has a \u2200x, and the consequent has another \u2200x, that's okay because they are separate scopes. So the formula as written is correct. \n\nTherefore, the final translation is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb))\n\nWait, the variables in the Q part: Q is \"[1] galumphed over [2]\". So the second argument is Rafin (b), so Qxb. Yes. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb))\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check once more. The main connective is the implication from the antecedent to the consequent. The antecedent is the negation of the universal statement. The consequent is the implication from \u00acRbb to the universal statement about raths. Yes. That seems right.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acRbb\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"There is not a tove that every rath chortled at.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"[1] is a tove\", O for \"[1] is a rath\", and P for \"[1] chortled at [2]\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The structure seems to be saying that it's not the case that there exists a tove such that every rath has chortled at it. In other words, there's no tove that all raths chortled at.\n\nBreaking it down, the original sentence can be rephrased as \"It is not true that there exists a tove x such that for all raths y, y chortled at x.\" \n\nIn predicate logic, the existence of such a tove would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyx)). Here, Mx ensures x is a tove, and for every y, if y is a rath (Oy), then y chortled at x (Pyx). \n\nBut since the sentence says there is not such a tove, we need to negate this entire statement. So the negation would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyx)). \n\nAlternatively, by moving the negation inside using quantifier negation rules, this is equivalent to \u2200x (\u00acMx \u2228 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyx)), but that's probably more complicated than needed. The original negation outside the existential quantifier is more straightforward and likely the correct approach here.\n\nI need to check if the original sentence is correctly interpreted. The phrase \"There is not a tove that every rath chortled at\" can be read as \"There does not exist a tove x for which every rath y chortled at x.\" So the correct formalization is indeed the negation of the existential quantifier, which is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyx)).\n\nAnother way to think about it: The statement claims that for all toves x, it's not the case that every rath chortled at x. But that would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyx)). However, this is equivalent to the previous expression because \u00ac\u2203x A is equivalent to \u2200x \u00acA. So both forms are equivalent, but the problem asks for a single well-formed formula. The first form with the negation in front of the existential quantifier is probably simpler.\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyx)).\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227\u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyx))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then [some statement].\" The antecedent is \"not all borogoves are mimsy,\" and the consequent is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all borogoves are mimsy.\" In predicate logic, \"all N are J\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So \"not all\" would be the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), but maybe the problem expects the direct negation of the universal statement. I'll go with \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) here.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" The phrase \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, A is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin,\" which is \u00acRbb (since R is the snicker-snack relation, and Rafin is b). B is \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" \n\nFor B: \"all toves galumphed over Bungo\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc), since M is tove, Q is galumphed over, and c is Bungo. So \"not all\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc), which again could be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc). But again, I'll use the negation of the universal form here.\n\nPutting it all together, the consequent is \u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc). \n\nSo the entire statement is: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc)). \n\nWait, but in formal logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, maybe the \"only if\" is correctly captured as the implication. Let me double-check: \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the sentence is \"Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves...\", then that's \u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nBut let me check if there's any other parts. The original sentence is \"If [antecedent], then [consequent].\" So the main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. The consequent itself is an implication. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any parts. The sentence structure is: If (not all borogoves are mimsy), then (Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo). So yes, the consequent is an implication where the antecedent is \u00acRbb and the consequent is the negation of the universal statement about toves.\n\nSo the final formula is as above. I need to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations are N, J, R, b, M, Q, c. So that's all correctly used here. \n\nI don't see any other parts to translate. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acRbb\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc))",

The sentence is \"No toves are uffish or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. It's a disjunction (OR) between two parts: \"No toves are uffish\" and \"every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"No toves are uffish.\" In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" is usually translated as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx). Here, A is \"toves\" (M) and B is \"uffish\" (K). So that would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acKx).\n\nThe second part: \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" \"Every A does R to b\" would be \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Rxb). Here, A is M, R is the snicker-snacked relation, and b is Zindle (a). So that's \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa).\n\nNow, the original sentence combines these two parts with \"or,\" which is logical disjunction (\u2228).

Each universal quantifier applies to its own part of the disjunction. So yes, each part is a separate universally quantified formula, and they are connected by \u2228. That seems right. There's no need to have a single quantifier covering both, since the original sentence is an \"or\" between two separate statements. \n\nLet me check if there's any ambiguity. The original sentence could be read as either \"No toves are uffish\" or \"every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" as two separate conditions.
