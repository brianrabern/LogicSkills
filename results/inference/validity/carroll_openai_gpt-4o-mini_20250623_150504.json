(Not necessarily true, as only borogoves whiffle and we don't know their types.)\n   - **Statement 2**: Zindle won't whiffle. (This could be true since Zindle is not confirmed to be a borogove.)\n   - **Statement 3**: Zindle gyred and only borogoves will whiffle. (This is true, but we don't know if Zindle is a borogove.)\n   - **Statement 4**: Zindle gyred and not all borogoves will whiffle. (This is possible but not necessarily true.)\n   - **Statement 5**: Zindle gyred and no borogoves will whiffle. (This contradicts the fact that only borogoves will whiffle.)\n   - **Statement 6**: Zindle will whiffle. (Not necessarily true, as Zindle could be a tove or a rath.)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only statement that must be true based on the information provided is **Statement 3**: \"Zindle gyred and only borogoves will whiffle.\" This is true because it aligns with the fact that only borogoves whiffle, regardless of whether Zindle is a borogove or not.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**Statement 3 must be true.**",

Not all toves chortled at Bungo, and no toves chortled at Bungo.\n4. If Zindle gimbled, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if no toves gimbled.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Every tove chortled at a rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. We know that no raths chortled at a tove, but we have no information about whether all toves chortled at raths.\n\n2. **A tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - This is also not necessarily true. Similar to the first statement, we cannot conclude that a tove chortled at every rath.\n\n3. **No raths chortled at every tove.**\n   - This statement is true because it is given that no raths chortled at a tove.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at every rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. We do not have enough information to conclude that no toves chortled at every rath.\n\n5. **Every tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - This is not true based on the information we have.

No borogoves chortled at a tove.\n4. No raths galumphed over a borogove.\n\nFrom the information, we can infer the following:\n\n- Since Rafin is a rath, we know that there are raths in the situation.\n- The statement \"No borogoves chortled at a tove\" implies that borogoves do not interact with toves in a way that involves chortling.\n- The statement \"No raths galumphed over a borogove\" indicates that raths do not galumph over borogoves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the statements:\n\n1. **Every borogove galumphed over a rath.**  \n   - This cannot be true because we know that no raths galumphed over borogoves, which implies that borogoves cannot galumph over raths either. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Every borogove galumphed over every rath.**  \n   - This is also false for the same reason as above. If no raths galumphed over borogoves, then it cannot be true that every borogove galumphed over every rath.\n\n3. **A borogove galumphed over a rath.**  \n   - This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the information provided. We know that raths do not galumph over borogoves, but we have no information about whether borogoves can galumph over raths. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No borogoves galumphed over every rath.**  \n   - This statement must be true because if any borogove galumphed over a rath, it would contradict the fact that no raths galumphed over borogoves. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **There is not a borogove that every rath galumphed over.**  \n   - This statement is true because if there were a borogove that every rath galumphed over, it would imply that raths can galumph over borogoves, which contradicts the information given. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n6. **A borogove galumphed over every rath.**  \n   - This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the information provided. We have no evidence that a borogove galumphed over any rath, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **4.

This means that if a tove snicker-snacked a rath, that rath cannot snicker-snack that tove back.\n3. **Raths and Borogoves**: Every rath snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked every rath. This implies a mutual snicker-snacking relationship between raths and borogoves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**  \n   - This is not necessarily true. The information does not state that every tove must snicker-snack a rath; it only states that every rath snicker-snacked every tove.\n\n2. **A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**  \n   - This could be true, but it is not guaranteed. There could be a scenario where no tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n\n3. **No toves snicker-snacked a rath.**  \n   - This is also not necessarily true. While it is possible, the information does not rule out the possibility of at least one tove snicker-snacking a rath.\n\n4. **Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**  \n   - This is not true based on the information provided. The raths snicker-snacked the toves, but it does not imply that the toves snicker-snacked the raths.\n\n5. **A tove snicker-snacked every rath.**  \n   - This is not necessarily true. Similar to the previous statements, there is no requirement for a tove to snicker-snack every rath.\n\n6. **A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.**  \n   - This statement is contradictory. It cannot be true that a borogove will burble and at the same time that no borogoves will burble.\n\nAfter analyzing all the statements, none of them must be true based on the information provided.

This means that if something is a rath, it cannot snicker-snack Bungo.\n3. **Rath snicker-snacking**: A rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked a borogove. This implies that at least one rath snicker-snacked another rath, which in turn snicker-snacked a borogove.\n4. **Rafin's snicker-snacking**: If no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin. This creates a conditional relationship between toves and Rafin's actions.\n5. **Chortling**: A borogove chortled at Bungo if and only if Rafin chortled at Bungo.

We cannot conclude that Bungo chortled at a borogove.\n\n3. **Bungo isn't a borogove if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement that cannot be verified with the information provided. We cannot conclude this.\n\n4. **No borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. We know that either every borogove chortled at Bungo or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle. We cannot conclude that no borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n\n5. **Every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is one possibility, but we cannot conclude it must be true since we also have the alternative that every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n6. **Bungo chortled at every borogove.**\n   - There is no information to support this statement. We cannot conclude that Bungo chortled at every borogove.\n\nAfter evaluating all the statements, we find that none of them must be true based on the information provided. The relationships and actions described do not lead to a definitive conclusion for any of the statements.\n\n**Final Answer**: None of the statements must be true.",

There is at least one of each.\n2. **Zindle's Behavior**: Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle and Zindle isn't mimsy.\n3. **Rath Behavior**: If every rath chortled at Rafin, then every rath is mimsy only if Rafin is a tove.\n4. **Chortling Events**:\n   - A borogove chortled at Rafin.\n   - Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n   - Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - We know a borogove did chortle at Rafin. However, Zindle is confirmed to not be mimsy. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - This contradicts the information that Zindle isn't mimsy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin or a borogove is mimsy.**\n   - We know Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle, and we have no information that contradicts Zindle not chortling at Rafin. Since we don't know if a borogove is mimsy, this statement could be true but is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This is a conditional statement that is difficult to evaluate without more information about the mimsy status of borogoves. It does not have to be true.\n\n5. **Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin unless a borogove is mimsy.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. Since we know Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle, we cannot conclude anything about Zindle's chortling at Rafin based on the mimsy status of borogoves. This statement does not have to be true.\n\n6. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n   - We know both parts of this statement are true: a borogove did chortle at Rafin, and Zindle isn't mimsy. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nAfter evaluating all the statements, the only one that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 6. A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle isn't mimsy.**",

This is a fact.\n   - Since no raths snicker-snacked Rafin, Rafin cannot be a rath.\n   - Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle, which means Bungo did not interact with Zindle in that way.\n   - Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo, which is a self-referential statement indicating Bungo did not find itself amusing.\n\n3. **Implications of the Conditional Statement**:\n   - The conditional statement about borogoves and Rafin implies that if a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then it can only snicker-snack Bungo if Rafin is beamish. This means that if Rafin is not beamish, then a borogove cannot snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Statements**:\n   - **Statement 1**: Rafin is uffish. (Not necessarily true; we have no information about Rafin's state.)\n   - **Statement 2**: Zindle and Rafin are uffish. (Only Zindle is confirmed to be uffish; we cannot conclude anything about Rafin.)\n   - **Statement 3**: Zindle is uffish but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle. (This contradicts the information that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.)\n   - **Statement 4**: Zindle is uffish and Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle. (This is true; Zindle is uffish, and we know Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.)\n   - **Statement 5**: Zindle and Bungo are uffish. (Only Zindle is confirmed to be uffish; we cannot conclude anything about Bungo.)\n   - **Statement 6**: Zindle isn't uffish.

There is at least one of each.\n2. **Chortling**: There is a specific tove that every tove chortled at. This implies that there is a tove that is notable among the toves.\n3. **Galumphing**: Every borogove galumphed over every tove. This means that for any borogove, it will galumph over any tove.\n4. **Uffish or Rath**: Every tove is either uffish or a rath galumphed over Zindle. This indicates that there is a distinction among toves, but it does not directly relate to the relationship between toves and borogoves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**  \n   - This is not necessarily true. We know that borogoves galumph over toves, but we have no information that indicates toves galumph over borogoves.\n\n2. **No toves galumphed over every borogove.**  \n   - This is also not necessarily true. While we know borogoves galumph over toves, we do not have information that excludes the possibility of toves galumphing over borogoves.\n\n3. **A tove galumphed over every borogove.**  \n   - This is not supported by the information given. We know borogoves galumph over toves, but we have no evidence that any tove galumphed over every borogove.\n\n4. **Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**  \n   - This is not necessarily true. We do not have information that guarantees every tove has galumphed over a borogove.\n\n5. **There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.**  \n   - This statement is true. Since every borogove galumphs over every tove, it follows that there is at least one tove (in fact, all toves) that every borogove galumphed over.\n\n6. **A tove galumphed over a borogove.**  \n   - This is not necessarily true based on the information provided. We know borogoves galumph over toves, but we do not have evidence that any tove has galumphed over a borogove.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 5.

This indicates some interaction between a rath and a tove.\n3. **Bungo and Zindle**: Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.

However, we know Bungo is mimsy, which implies that there is at least one borogove that is not mimsy.\n   - Since only borogoves can be beamish, and Bungo is not a borogove, it follows that there must be at least one borogove that is beamish.\n\n4. **Evaluating the statements:**\n   - **1. Zindle is mimsy.** (Not necessarily true; we have no information about Zindle.)\n   - **2. Every borogove is beamish.** (Not true; we know that Bungo is mimsy, which implies that not all borogoves can be beamish.)\n   - **3. No borogoves are beamish.** (False; we established that at least one borogove is beamish.)\n   - **4. Not all borogoves are beamish.** (True; since Bungo is mimsy, at least one borogove must be mimsy.)\n   - **5. Only borogoves are beamish and not all borogoves are beamish.** (True; this is consistent with our findings.)\n   - **6. A borogove is beamish.** (True; we established that at least one borogove is beamish.)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The statements that must be true are:\n     - 4.

However, not all borogoves will whiffle.\n4. **Rath Behavior**: Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Only borogoves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.**  \n   - This is true based on the information provided. It states that only borogoves whiffle, and we know that not all borogoves will whiffle.\n\n2. **Only borogoves will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.**  \n   - This is contradictory. If only borogoves whiffle, then it cannot be true that no borogoves will whiffle.\n\n3. **No borogoves will whiffle.**  \n   - This contradicts the information that states only borogoves will whiffle.\n\n4. **A borogove will whiffle.**  \n   - This is not necessarily true because we know that not all borogoves will whiffle. There could be borogoves that do not whiffle.\n\n5. **Every borogove will whiffle.**  \n   - This is false because we know that not all borogoves will whiffle.\n\n6. **Not all borogoves will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.**  \n   - This is contradictory. While it is true that not all borogoves will whiffle, it cannot be true that no borogoves will whiffle.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 1. Only borogoves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.**",

This means Zindle is either a tove or a borogove since it is not a rath.\n3. **Galumphing Relationships**: Every rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it. This indicates a mutual relationship among raths.\n4. **Conditional Statement**: If Bungo galumphed over Zindle, then every rath is beamish only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.

Only toves are stated to whiffle. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n2. **Zindle chortled at Bungo.**\n   - We know that every rath chortled at Zindle, but we have no information about Zindle's behavior towards Bungo. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n3. **Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n   - Since Bungo is a rath and every rath chortled at Zindle, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle's behavior towards Bungo. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n5. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - We cannot conclude this because Zindle's category is not specified as a tove. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n6. **Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle.**\n   - Since we established that Bungo, being a rath, must chortle at Zindle, this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 3. Bungo chortled at Zindle.**",

This means that statement 3 (\"A borogove chortled at a rath\") must be true because there are multiple raths and at least one borogove chortled at each of them.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the other statements:\n\n1. **No borogoves chortled at every rath**: This cannot be determined as true or false based on the information given. We know that borogoves chortled at every rath, but we don't know if there are any that did not.\n  \n2. **There is a borogove that every rath chortled at**: This statement is ambiguous and cannot be confirmed as true. We know borogoves chortled at every rath, but we do not know if there is a specific borogove that every rath chortled at.\n\n3. **A borogove chortled at a rath**: This is true, as established earlier.\n\n4. **Every borogove chortled at every rath**: This is not necessarily true. We know that at least one borogove chortled at every rath, but we cannot conclude that every borogove did.\n\n5. **No borogoves chortled at a rath**: This is false, as we know that borogoves did chortle at raths.\n\n6. **Every borogove chortled at a rath**: This is not necessarily true, similar to statement 4.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer**: 3.

This means at least one rath has interacted with a tove.\n3. **Rath Interaction**: Every rath galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it.

However, since every rath galumphed over Rafin, Rafin cannot be a rath (as raths galumphed over Rafin). Therefore, Rafin must be a borogove.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Zindle isn't a borogove**: This must be true because every borogove chortled at Zindle, and borogoves cannot chortle at each other.\n   \n2. **Rafin is a tove**: This is false because we established that Rafin is a borogove.\n\n3. **Zindle is a borogove**: This is false because we established that Zindle cannot be a borogove.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't a tove**: This must be true because if Zindle were a tove, then borogoves would chortle at Zindle, which contradicts the rule that borogoves cannot chortle at each other.\n\n5. **Zindle is a tove**: This is false because we established that Zindle cannot be a tove.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Zindle isn't a borogove (Statement 1).\n- Zindle isn't a tove (Statement 4).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**Statements 1 and 4 must be true.**",

Since there are raths, at least one must chortle at another.\n\n2. **There is not a rath that every rath chortled at.**\n   - This must be true because the first rule states that no raths chortled at every rath. Therefore, it is impossible for there to be a rath that every rath chortled at.\n\n3. **Every rath chortled at a rath.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. While some raths may chortle at other raths, the rules do not guarantee that every rath chortled at at least one rath.\n\n4. **A rath chortled at every rath.**\n   - This is false because the first rule states that no raths chortled at every rath.\n\n5. **Every rath chortled at every rath.**\n   - This is false because the first rule states that no raths chortled at every rath.\n\n6. **No raths chortled at a rath.**\n   - This is false because we have established that at least some raths chortled at other raths.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1.

This implies that at least one tove did not galumph over at least one borogove.\n3. **Rath and Tove Interaction**: A rath galumphed over a tove that galumphed over a borogove.
