This gives us some information about interactions but doesn't directly affect the donkey-monkey interactions.\n\n6. **Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement: if every monkey chased Hazel, then every human chased Hazel, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Every donkey saw every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey\" only requires each donkey to see at least one monkey, not every monkey.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts the condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **There is a donkey that every monkey saw.**\n   - There is no information given that supports this statement. The conditions do not imply that any donkey is seen by every monkey.\n\n4. **A donkey saw a monkey.**\n   - This must be true because the condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey\" implies that at least one donkey saw at least one monkey.\n\n5. **A donkey saw every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey\" does not imply that any donkey saw every monkey.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw every monkey.**\n   - This is consistent with the condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey,\" which does not require any donkey to see every monkey. However, it is not necessarily true unless we assume there are multiple monkeys and no donkey saw all of them.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n4. **A donkey saw a monkey.**",

      "model_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's analyze the given statements and conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means every individual in the scenario is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **Alfred doesn't see Alfred.**\n   - Alfred cannot see himself.\n\n3. **If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. If all monkeys see Lewis, then for all monkeys to be asleep, Lewis must be a donkey.\n\n4. **A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - At least one human saw Lewis. Hazel can see herself.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - Alfred is awake. Lewis cannot see Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - This contradicts the given condition that Alfred isn't asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - A human saw Lewis is true, but \"it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep\" implies Alfred is asleep, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred.**\n   - Since Alfred doesn't see Alfred (given), the condition \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is false. Therefore, \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred\" simplifies to \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" because the condition is false. This statement is true if Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n\n4. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep.**\n   - This is a disjunction. If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, the statement is true. If a human is asleep, the statement is also true. We know a human saw Lewis, but we don't have information about whether they are asleep. However, since Alfred doesn't see Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel, it's plausible that Alfred doesn't see Lewis, making this statement true.\n\n5. **A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - Both parts of this conjunction are true based on the given conditions. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless a human is asleep.**\n   - This is equivalent to saying if no human is asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis. We don't have information about whether humans are asleep, but if we assume Alfred doesn't see Lewis (as per statement 4), this statement holds true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **4. Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep.**\n- **5. A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that statements 4 and 5 must be true.",

Every monkey saw Alfred.\n6.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A monkey saw Alfred only if a donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. The condition \"a monkey saw Alfred\" is true because every monkey saw Alfred (from condition 5). However, \"a donkey saw Lewis\" is false because no donkeys saw Lewis (from condition 3). Therefore, the statement \"A monkey saw Alfred only if a donkey saw Lewis\" is false because the condition is true, but the consequence is false.\n\n3. **Alfred won't attack.**\n   - This contradicts condition 2, which states that Alfred will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Lewis and Hazel will attack.**\n   - We know Lewis will attack (from condition 2), but we have no information about Hazel attacking. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **If a monkey saw Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This is similar to statement 2. The condition \"a monkey saw Alfred\" is true, but \"a donkey saw Lewis\" is false. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw Lewis and every monkey saw Alfred.**\n   - This statement directly restates conditions 3 and 5.

Without knowing Alfred's species, we cannot definitively say he will run.\n\n3. **Lewis ate and only humans will run.**\n   - We know Lewis ate (condition 3), but condition 6 states that no humans will run, making this statement impossible.\n\n4. **A human will attack and no humans will attack.**\n   - This statement is contradictory. It cannot be true because it asserts both the occurrence and non-occurrence of the same event.\n\n5. **Lewis ate and no humans will run.**\n   - This statement is consistent with the given conditions. Lewis ate (condition 3), and condition 6 states that no humans will run. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - If either Alfred or Hazel is a human, they will not run due to condition 6.

Since Lewis chased someone, Lewis cannot be a donkey (as donkeys are not mentioned to chase anyone), so Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n\n4. **Every donkey saw Hazel only if not all donkeys are hungry.**  \n   This statement doesn't directly affect the relationships between monkeys, humans, and donkeys in terms of chasing.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **There is a monkey that every monkey chased.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The statement \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it\" implies mutual chasing, but not necessarily that there is one specific monkey that every monkey chased.\n\n2. **A monkey chased a monkey.**  \n   This must be true. From the statement \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it,\" it follows that there is at least one instance where a monkey chased another monkey.\n\n3. **A monkey chased every monkey.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The mutual chasing relationship does not imply that there is one monkey that chased every other monkey.\n\n4. **No monkeys chased a monkey.**  \n   This is false, as it contradicts the statement \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\"\n\n5. **Every monkey chased every monkey.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The mutual chasing relationship implies that each monkey chased at least one other monkey, but not necessarily every other monkey.\n\n6. **No monkeys chased every monkey.**  \n   This is consistent with the mutual chasing relationship, as it does not require any single monkey to have chased every other monkey.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n2. **A monkey chased a monkey.**",

It depends on whether Lewis is a human and whether humans can see each other.\n\n5. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The problem does not provide enough information to definitively categorize Alfred as a donkey.\n\n6. **Every human saw Lewis.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. While Lewis saw every human, it doesn't guarantee that every human saw Lewis unless Lewis is a human.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n2. **Lewis saw a human.**",

However, it doesn't provide direct information about the chasing relationships.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The condition states that every donkey chased a monkey that chased it, but it doesn't imply that a donkey chased every monkey.\n\n2. **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - This must be true because the condition states that every donkey chased a monkey that chased it. Therefore, at least one donkey chased at least one monkey.\n\n3. **No donkeys chased a monkey.**\n   - This is false because we know from the condition that every donkey chased a monkey that chased it.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The condition only states that every donkey chased a monkey that chased it, not every monkey.\n\n5. **There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The condition only states that for every donkey, there is a monkey that chased it, not that every monkey chased the same donkey.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - This is true. The condition only states that every donkey chased a monkey that chased it, not every monkey. Therefore, it is possible that no donkey chased every monkey.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n2. A donkey chased a monkey.",

Since Hazel is hungry, it is possible for some or all donkeys to attack, but we cannot definitively say that not all will attack.\n\n3. **No donkeys will attack.**  \n   This statement contradicts the condition that donkeys can attack if Hazel is hungry.

In fact, since they are asleep, it is unlikely they will run.\n\n3. **Alfred will run.**\n   - Again, there is no information to support that Alfred will run, especially since he is asleep.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - There is no information to support that either Alfred or Lewis will run.\n\n5. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - Since Alfred is asleep, it is reasonable to conclude that he won't run, making this statement likely true.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys will run and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given information that Alfred is asleep, so it cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 1: \"Not all donkeys will run but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.\"\n- Statement 5: \"Alfred won't run.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that statements 1 and 5 must be true.",

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is happy.**\n   - Condition 2 confirms that not all monkeys kicked Lewis. Condition 8 states that Lewis isn't happy. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - We need to determine if Alfred will attack. From condition 6, if Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis. Since not all monkeys kicked Lewis (condition 2), this condition doesn't apply. We don't have enough information to conclude that Alfred will attack.\n\n5. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis is happy.**\n   - Condition 2 confirms that not all monkeys kicked Lewis, but condition 8 states that Lewis isn't happy.

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Hazel saw Hazel and no humans will run.**  \n   This contradicts the fact that not all humans will run, meaning at least one human will run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Hazel saw Hazel and only humans will run.**  \n   This is false because every donkey will run, so it cannot be only humans running.\n\n6. **Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run.**  \n   We know Hazel saw Hazel, and it is given that not all humans will run.

      "model_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's analyze the given statements and the relationships between donkeys, humans, and monkeys.\n\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**  \n   - This means the set of all entities is partitioned into donkeys, humans, and monkeys, with at least one member in each category.\n\n2. **Lewis is a human.**  \n   - Lewis belongs to the human category.\n\n3. **Every monkey chased every donkey.**  \n   - This implies that for each monkey, it chased all donkeys. Therefore, no donkey can chase a monkey because the problem states that monkeys chase donkeys, not the other way around.\n\n4. **A monkey saw a human that saw a monkey.**  \n   - This indicates a chain of sight involving a monkey, a human, and another monkey.\n\n5. **A monkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.**  \n   - This is a conditional statement. If not all monkeys saw Hazel, then a monkey kicked Lewis. If all monkeys saw Hazel, then a monkey did not necessarily kick Lewis.\n\n6. **Not all humans kicked Alfred just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.**  \n   - This is another conditional statement. If no monkeys saw Lewis, then not all humans kicked Alfred. If at least one monkey saw Lewis, then all humans could have kicked Alfred.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **A donkey chased a monkey.**  \n   - This cannot be true because the problem states that every monkey chased every donkey, implying that donkeys do not chase monkeys.\n\n2. **A donkey chased every monkey.**  \n   - This cannot be true for the same reason as above.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased a monkey.**  \n   - This cannot be true because the problem specifies that monkeys chase donkeys, not the other way around.\n\n4. **A monkey chased every donkey.**  \n   - This is true because the problem explicitly states that every monkey chased every donkey.\n\n5. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**  \n   - This cannot be true because the problem states that monkeys chase donkeys, not the other way around.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**  \n   - This is true because the problem specifies that monkeys chase donkeys, not the other way around.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **4. A monkey chased every donkey.**\n- **6. No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n\nThese are the statements that align with the given conditions and logical deductions.",

It contradicts itself.\n\n5. **Every human will run.**\n   - This statement is false because it is given that no humans will run.\n\n6. **Only humans will run.**\n   - This statement is false because it is given that no humans will run, and every donkey will run.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. **Not all humans will run.**\n\nFinal Answer: 1.

However, Lewis could also be a monkey, as monkeys can be happy too.\n\n3. **If Alfred ate, then every monkey chased Hazel only if a human chased Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement.

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This is a contradiction because \"just in case\" means \"if and only if,\" and it is impossible for every human to be asleep if not all humans are asleep.

Let's break it down:\n     - If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then the condition \"every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel\" must hold.\n     - The phrase \"only if\" indicates a necessary condition, so \"every monkey saw Hazel\" implies \"every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Every human saw Hazel.**\n   - This statement would satisfy the condition \"every human saw Hazel\" in the conditional statement. However, we need to determine if it must be true in all cases.\n\n2. **No humans saw Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts the statement that Hazel saw every human, as seeing is typically a mutual action. If Hazel saw every human, at least some humans must have seen Hazel.\n\n3. **Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - This is the negation of statement 1. We need to determine if it's possible for this to be true without contradiction.\n\n4. **Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement. If Hazel is a human, then Hazel saw herself, which satisfies the condition of a human seeing Hazel. If Hazel isn't a human, then we need to check if a human seeing Hazel is necessary.\n\n5. **A human saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel saw every human, and seeing is typically mutual, it is reasonable to conclude that at least one human saw Hazel.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a human.**\n   - This is explicitly stated in the problem: Hazel saw every human.\n\nLet's focus on the conditional statement: \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n\n- If Alfred did kick Hazel, the conditional statement is irrelevant, and we only need to satisfy the other conditions.\n- If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then for the conditional to be true, either:\n  - Every human saw Hazel, or\n  - Not every monkey saw Hazel.\n\nGiven that Hazel saw every human, it is reasonable to conclude that at least one human saw Hazel, satisfying statement 5.\n\n**Final Answer: 5.

Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.\n   - This statement is a contradiction. If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel cannot be a human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. Hazel is a human.\n   - We have already deduced that Hazel cannot be a human because Hazel kicked a donkey, and no humans kicked a donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. Alfred will attack.\n   - We need to analyze the condition: \"If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\"\n   - If Alfred won't attack, then for the condition to hold, either not all donkeys kicked Hazel, or every monkey saw Hazel must be true.\n   - However, we don't have enough information to definitively conclude whether Alfred will attack or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n4. Alfred and Hazel will attack.\n   - Since we cannot determine if Alfred will attack, we cannot conclude that both Alfred and Hazel will attack. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n5. Hazel isn't a human.\n   - We have already deduced that Hazel cannot be a human because Hazel kicked a donkey, and no humans kicked a donkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.\n   - This statement is a contradiction. If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel cannot be a human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n5. Hazel isn't a human.",

However, the condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it\" does not imply that every donkey must be kicked by another donkey. It only establishes a reciprocal kicking relationship if a kicking occurs. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No donkeys kicked a donkey.**  \n   This contradicts the condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it,\" which implies that if a donkey is kicked, it must kick back. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked every donkey.**  \n   This is a stronger statement than required by the conditions. The condition only establishes a reciprocal relationship, not that every donkey kicks every other donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.**  \n   This would imply a specific donkey is kicked by all other donkeys. The conditions do not support this, as they only establish reciprocal kicking if a kicking occurs. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked a donkey.**  \n   Given the condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it,\" there must be at least one instance of a donkey kicking another donkey to satisfy this condition. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked every donkey.**  \n   This statement is consistent with the conditions, as the conditions do not require any donkey to kick every other donkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **5. A donkey kicked a donkey.**\n- **6. No donkeys kicked every donkey.**\n\nThus, the final answer is that statements 5 and 6 must be true.",

Additionally, every donkey drank.\n\n3. **A monkey is hungry and Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - This indicates that there is at least one hungry monkey. Hazel saw Alfred, but this doesn't provide information about Hazel's species.\n\n4. **Every monkey drank but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - This implies that every monkey drank.

Since we know a monkey is hungry, Lewis must be a monkey.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Not all monkeys drank.**\n   - This is false because the problem states that every monkey drank.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We know that every monkey drank, and Lewis is a monkey, so Lewis drank. However, we don't have enough information to conclude that Alfred drank because Alfred could be a human, and the problem doesn't state that humans drank. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred drank.**\n   - As mentioned above, we cannot conclude that Alfred drank because he could be a human, and the problem doesn't state that humans drank. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Only monkeys drank.**\n   - This is false because the problem states that every donkey drank, so donkeys also drank.\n\n5. **A monkey drank.**\n   - This is true because the problem states that every monkey drank, so at least one monkey drank.\n\n6. **No monkeys drank.**\n   - This is false because the problem states that every monkey drank.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n5. **A monkey drank.**",

If all donkeys attack, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every donkey is happy.**\n   - This is not necessarily true, even if all donkeys attack, because the condition allows for the possibility of happiness but does not guarantee it.\n\n3. **A donkey is happy.**\n   - This is not necessarily true, as it depends on whether all donkeys attack and whether happiness is achieved.\n\n4. **Every donkey will run.**\n   - This is not necessarily true, as the running condition applies to monkeys, not donkeys.\n\n5. **Only donkeys are happy.**\n   - This is not necessarily true, as it depends on the happiness of donkeys, which is not guaranteed.\n\n6. **A human will attack and no humans will attack.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1. **No donkeys are happy.**\n\nThis is because if not all donkeys attack, then no donkeys are happy must be true to satisfy the disjunction in statement 2. If all donkeys attack, the possibility of happiness exists but is not guaranteed, so the statement \"No donkeys are happy\" is the only one that must be true in at least one scenario.",

This statement is true.\n\n2. \"If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\"\n   - If not all humans are asleep, then not every human chased Hazel (from condition 2). From condition 3, if not every human chased Hazel, then not every monkey chased Hazel. Therefore, the condition \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is vacuously true because the antecedent (every monkey chased Hazel) is false. This statement is true.\n\n3. \"If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\"\n   - If not all humans are asleep, then not every human chased Hazel (from condition 2). From condition 3, if not every human chased Hazel, then not every monkey chased Hazel. The statement \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep\" does not logically follow from the given conditions. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. \"Not all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n   - From condition 2, if not all humans are asleep, then not every human chased Hazel. From condition 3, if not every human chased Hazel, then not every monkey chased Hazel. Therefore, \"not all humans are asleep\" implies \"not every monkey chased Hazel,\" which is the opposite of the statement. This statement is not true.\n\n5. \"Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n   - This is a restatement of the logical equivalence derived from conditions 2 and 3. This statement is true.\n\n6. \"If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\"\n   - If every human is asleep, then every human chased Hazel (from condition 2). From condition 3, if every human chased Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel. The statement \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" does not logically follow from the given conditions. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n1. A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n2. If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n5. Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nFinal answer:\nStatements 1, 2, and 5 must be true.",

This statement could be true if Lewis sees Hazel, but it doesn't have to be true based on the information given.\n\n2. **Lewis saw Lewis just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n   - \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" This statement would be true if Lewis seeing Lewis is equivalent to a human seeing Hazel. However, we have no information linking Lewis seeing himself to a human seeing Hazel.\n\n3. **A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - A human saw Lewis is given. Hazel saw Hazel is also given. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - Again, \"just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" We have no information about Lewis seeing himself or the condition of all humans seeing Hazel, so this statement cannot be determined to be true.\n\n5. **A human saw Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - A human saw Lewis is given. \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" contradicts statement 1, which is possible but not necessary. This statement could be true, but it doesn't have to be.\n\n6. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - A human saw Lewis is given. However, \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" contradicts the given information that Hazel sees Hazel.

Since every monkey kicked Lewis, Lewis cannot be a monkey (as monkeys don't kick themselves). Therefore, Lewis is either a donkey or a human.\n   - A monkey kicked Alfred, so Alfred is not a monkey. Alfred is either a donkey or a human.\n\n4. **If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no donkeys ate.**\n   - This is a conditional statement that doesn't directly help us determine the truth of the given options without additional context about Hazel or the actions of donkeys.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - We have no information suggesting that donkeys kicked monkeys. The problem only states that monkeys kicked donkeys.\n\n2. **A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - Again, there is no information provided that suggests any donkey kicked any monkey.\n\n3. **No donkeys kicked every monkey.**\n   - This statement is consistent with the information given, as there is no evidence that any donkey kicked any monkey.\n\n4. **Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - There is no information to support this. The problem only states that monkeys kicked donkeys.\n\n5. **Every donkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - There is no information to support this. The problem only states that monkeys kicked donkeys.\n\n6. **A monkey kicked every donkey.**\n   - This statement is true based on the information given: \"Every monkey kicked every donkey.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n6.

Also, there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **Lewis is a donkey unless Hazel isn't a human.**\n   - This is a conditional statement: If Hazel isn't a human, then Lewis is not a donkey. Conversely, if Lewis is a donkey, then Hazel must be a human.\n\n3. **A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - This tells us that there is a hungry monkey, and Lewis is not a donkey.\n\n4. **Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - This means Alfred is not hungry, and Lewis is hungry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- From statement 3, we know Lewis is not a donkey. Therefore, according to statement 2, Hazel must be a human (because if Hazel were not a human, Lewis would be a donkey, which contradicts statement 3).\n\n- Since Hazel is a human, Lewis cannot be a donkey, so Lewis must be either a human or a monkey. However, since Hazel is already the human, Lewis must be a monkey (because there is at least one of each, and Lewis cannot be a donkey).\n\n- From statement 4, Lewis is hungry. Since Lewis is a monkey (from the above deduction), this satisfies the condition that a monkey is hungry.\n\n- Alfred is not hungry, as stated in statement 4.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - False. We know Alfred is not hungry.\n\n2. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a contradiction. If Hazel isn't a human, she cannot be a human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Hazel is a human.**\n   - True. We have deduced that Hazel must be a human.\n\n4. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a logical contradiction and is always false.\n\n5. **Hazel isn't a human.**\n   - False.

Not all donkeys will attack or every human saw Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\"\n   - We know from the problem that no donkeys saw Hazel, so \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true.\n   - However, \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey\" implies Lewis is a donkey, which contradicts the given information that Lewis isn't a donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n   - \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true because no donkeys saw Hazel.\n   - The problem doesn't provide information about whether Lewis sees Hazel or not, so we cannot definitively conclude that \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true.\n\n3. \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n   - \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true.\n   - \"It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" implies that Lewis does see Hazel, but we have no information to confirm this. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true.\n\n4. \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n   - This statement is self-contradictory.

However, the statement also claims that Lewis isn't a donkey. The problem doesn't provide direct information about Lewis's identity, so we cannot definitively conclude that Lewis isn't a donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis saw every donkey.**\n   - The problem does not provide any information about what Lewis saw. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lewis saw every donkey. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - Since no donkeys saw Lewis, it is true that not all donkeys saw Lewis.

The statement \"Every monkey kicked Lewis\" only tells us Lewis is not a monkey. Lewis could still be a donkey or a human.\n\n2. **Hazel is a donkey.**\n   - This contradicts the statement \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" Therefore, Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a donkey.**\n   - This must be true because \"No donkeys saw Hazel,\" and Hazel saw Hazel. Therefore, Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n\n4. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - There is no information that directly supports or contradicts this statement. Alfred could be a donkey, human, or monkey.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't a donkey.**\n   - Similarly, there is no information that directly supports or contradicts this statement. Alfred could be a donkey, human, or monkey.\n\n6. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - This is possible, but not necessarily true.

This creates a situation where no two monkeys have a mutual sighting of each other.\n\n4. **A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Lewis ate.**  \n   This tells us two things:\n   - There exists at least one monkey who is hungry.\n   - Lewis did not eat.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements about Lewis:\n\n- **Statement 4: Lewis ate.**  \n  This is false because it is explicitly stated that \"it is not the case that Lewis ate.\"\n\n- **Statement 3: Lewis is a monkey.**  \n  If Lewis were a monkey, then according to the rule \"every monkey ate,\" Lewis must have eaten. However, it is given that Lewis did not eat. Therefore, Lewis cannot be a monkey.\n\n- **Statement 5: Lewis isn't a monkey.**  \n  Since we have established that Lewis cannot be a monkey (because he did not eat), this statement must be true.\n\n- **Statement 1: Lewis is hungry.**  \n  We know that a monkey is hungry, but since Lewis is not a monkey, this does not directly imply that Lewis is hungry. There is no information given about the hunger status of donkeys or humans, so we cannot conclude that Lewis is hungry.\n\n- **Statement 2: Lewis isn't hungry.**  \n  Similarly, there is no information that directly states that Lewis isn't hungry. The problem does not provide enough information to determine the hunger status of Lewis if he is not a monkey.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**5.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every human is happy.\n3. A monkey chased Alfred.\n4. It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel, which means Lewis sees Hazel.\n5. If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every human saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n   - Since every human is happy, if Alfred and Lewis are humans, they are happy. However, we don't have enough information to confirm their species. This statement cannot be determined as true without additional information.\n\n2. **A monkey is happy and every human chased Alfred.**\n   - We know every human is happy, but we don't have information about the happiness of monkeys. Also, we only know a monkey chased Alfred, not that every human did. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n3. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - We don't have information about Alfred's species. If Alfred is a human, he is happy, but if he is a donkey or a monkey, we cannot conclude he is happy. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel are happy.**\n   - Similar to the previous point, we don't know Alfred's species. If Alfred is a human, he is happy, but we don't have information about Hazel's species or happiness. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't happy.**\n   - This is the opposite of statement 3. Since we cannot determine if Alfred is happy, we also cannot determine if he isn't happy. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n6. **A human is happy and a monkey chased Alfred.**\n   - We know every human is happy, so at least one human is happy. We also know a monkey chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**6.

It explicitly states that no donkey has kicked a monkey.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis is happy.**  \n   This statement doesn't directly impact the truth of the options provided, but it tells us that at least one donkey did not see Hazel.\n\n4. **A monkey kicked Hazel only if a monkey saw Alfred.**  \n   This is a conditional statement.

However, it doesn't tell us whether a monkey actually kicked Hazel or saw Alfred.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **Every donkey kicked a monkey.**  \n   This cannot be true because we know from the conditions that no donkeys kicked a monkey.\n\n2. **A donkey kicked every monkey.**  \n   This cannot be true because no donkeys kicked a monkey.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked every monkey.**  \n   This cannot be true because no donkeys kicked a monkey.\n\n4. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**  \n   This statement is a logical contradiction. \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if,\" so it states that every human is asleep if and only if not all humans are asleep, which is impossible.

The statement \"Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human\" is only true if Hazel is indeed a human, because if Hazel were not a human, the condition would be false.\n\n5. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n   - \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" Therefore, Alfred doesn't see Hazel if and only if a human saw Hazel. Since Hazel is a human (from point 4), Hazel saw herself, satisfying the condition that a human saw Hazel. Thus, Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n\n6. **A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - \"It is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" means Hazel did chase Hazel. Since Hazel is a human, this doesn't directly affect the monkey's actions or observations.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Every monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - We know a monkey saw every human, and Hazel is a human. Therefore, at least one monkey saw Hazel. However, this doesn't imply every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n2. **Hazel saw every monkey.**\n   - There is no information given that Hazel saw any monkeys, only that Hazel chased every donkey.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - We know at least one monkey saw Hazel, but we don't have information about all monkeys. This statement could be true, but it doesn't necessarily have to be true based on the given information.\n\n4. **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This is false because we know at least one monkey saw every human, including Hazel.\n\n5. **Hazel saw a monkey.**\n   - There is no information given that Hazel saw any monkeys.\n\n6. **A monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - This must be true because a monkey saw every human, and Hazel is a human.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n6. **A monkey saw Hazel.**",

If a human kicked a donkey, that donkey must have kicked the human first.\n\n3. **A human is happy and Lewis didn't kick Alfred.**\n   - This tells us that there is at least one happy human, and Lewis (a human) did not kick Alfred (who could be a donkey, human, or monkey).\n\n4. **If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement.

No donkeys saw every monkey. There is a human that every donkey chased. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel. Not all donkeys chased Alfred and Hazel saw Alfred.\n\nWhich, if any, of the following statements must be true in this situation?\n\n1. A donkey chased a human.\n2. There is a donkey that every human chased.\n3. Every donkey chased every human.\n4. No donkeys chased a human.\n5. A donkey chased every human.\n6. No donkeys chased every human.\n",

This means every donkey chased \\( H_1 \\).\n\n- **If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.**  \n  This is a conditional statement that doesn't directly affect the options unless we know more about Lewis and Hazel.\n\n- **Not all donkeys chased Alfred and Hazel saw Alfred.**  \n  Some donkeys did not chase Alfred, and Hazel (who is a human or a monkey) saw Alfred.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n1. **A donkey chased a human.**  \n   Since there is a human \\( H_1 \\) that every donkey chased, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **There is a donkey that every human chased.**  \n   There is no information to support that every human chased the same donkey. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased every human.**  \n   The statement \"There is a human that every donkey chased\" does not imply that every donkey chased every human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased a human.**  \n   This contradicts the given information that there is a human \\( H_1 \\) that every donkey chased. This statement is false.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every human.**  \n   The information provided does not support that a single donkey chased every human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased every human.**  \n   This statement is consistent with the information provided, as there is no evidence that a single donkey chased every human. However, it does not have to be true, as the possibility is not ruled out by the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1. **A donkey chased a human.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n1. A donkey chased a human.",

Lewis could be a donkey or a monkey.\n   - Every monkey saw Alfred, so Alfred is either a human or a donkey.\n\n5. **Every donkey is happy unless Hazel doesn't see Alfred.**\n   - If Hazel doesn't see Alfred, then donkeys are not happy.

We know every monkey saw Alfred, but it doesn't imply Alfred saw a monkey.\n\n2. **No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - False. We know every monkey saw Alfred.\n\n3. **A monkey saw Alfred.**\n   - True.

Alfred could be a human who didn't drink or a donkey.\n\n6. **Alfred saw every monkey.**\n   - Not necessarily true.
