So both sides of this biconditional are true, making the entire statement true.\n\n5. \"If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n   We know the antecedent \"no humans are hungry\" is true. For the consequent, we have no information about whether Alfred sees himself or whether humans see Hazel, so we can't determine if this must be true.\n\n6. \"Alfred and Hazel are hungry.\"\n   Similar to statement 1, if either Alfred or Hazel is human, this statement is false. But we don't know their types, so we can't determine if this must be true.\n\nLooking at all statements, only statement 4 must be true because both parts of the biconditional are established facts in the given situation.\n\nFinal answer: Statement 4 \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no humans are hungry\" must be true.",

This is logically possible, so Alfred could be a donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. \"Hazel is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred\" - We know Hazel is happy, and we know not all donkeys chased Alfred. So both parts of this biconditional are true. However, this doesn't mean they're logically connected. This statement claims a specific relationship that isn't established in the premises, so it's not necessarily true.\n\n4. \"Alfred is a donkey\" - As analyzed in #2, Alfred could be a donkey, but he could also be a human or a monkey based on the given information.

Since no monkey saw any monkey (from \"No monkeys saw a monkey\"), there are no monkeys that saw any given monkey.

Everything is exclusively a donkey, human, or monkey, with at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n3. It is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel. This means Hazel sees Hazel.\n4. If Hazel kicked Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n5. Not all humans will run.\n6. Every donkey will run.\n\nNow, let's determine what we know about Hazel:\n\nFrom point 3, we know that Hazel sees Hazel. This is a definite fact.\n\nFrom point 5, we know that not all humans will run. This means at least one human won't run.\n\nNow, let's check each of the given statements:\n\n1. \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel and a human will run.\" - This is false because we know Hazel sees Hazel.\n\n2. \"Hazel will run.\" - We don't know what Hazel is (donkey, human, or monkey), so we can't determine this.\n\n3. \"Hazel saw Hazel and a human will run.\" - We know Hazel saw Hazel, but we don't know if any human will run. We only know not all humans will run.\n\n4. \"Hazel saw Hazel and no humans will run.\" - We know Hazel saw Hazel, but \"no humans will run\" contradicts \"not all humans will run\" (which allows for some humans running).\n\n5. \"Hazel saw Hazel and only humans will run.\" - We know Hazel saw Hazel, but \"only humans will run\" contradicts \"every donkey will run.\"\n\n6. \"Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run.\" - We know Hazel saw Hazel, and we know not all humans will run. Both parts are true.\n\nTherefore, statement 6 \"Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run\" must be true in this situation.\n\nFinal answer: Statement 6 is the only statement that must be true.",

If Alfred is a donkey, then Alfred will run. If Alfred is a human or monkey, Alfred might not run.

So it's true that \"not all humans saw Alfred,\" but this is actually an understatement.\n\nStatement 2: \"A human saw Alfred.\"\nThis contradicts our given fact that \"No humans saw Alfred.\" So this is false.\n\nStatement 3: \"Alfred saw a human.\"\nWe have no information about who Alfred saw, so we can't determine this.\n\nStatement 4: \"Every human saw Alfred.\"\nThis contradicts our given fact that \"No humans saw Alfred.\" So this is false.\n\nStatement 5: \"Alfred saw every human.\"\nAgain, we have no information about who Alfred saw, so we can't determine this.\n\nStatement 6: \"Alfred will attack.\"\nLet's analyze the conditional statement: \"If Alfred won't attack, then (every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel)\"\n\nSince we know \"No humans saw Alfred,\" it's possible that some humans didn't see Hazel either. If some humans didn't see Hazel, then the consequent \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel\" would make \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" false.\n\nSo if Alfred won't attack, we'd have a situation where the consequent is false, which would make the entire conditional statement false. But we're told this conditional statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent \"Alfred won't attack\" must be false, which means \"Alfred will attack\" must be true.\n\nThe final answer is: Statement 6, \"Alfred will attack,\" must be true in this situation.",

But we don't have information about other humans. There could be other humans who are asleep. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. \"Every human is asleep if and only if a human is asleep.\"\n   This is a logical tautology of the form \"P if and only if P\" where P is \"a human is asleep.\" Any statement of this form is always true, regardless of whether humans are actually asleep or not.\n\n3. \"A human is asleep.\"\n   We know Alfred is a human who is not asleep, but we don't know about other humans. Some might be asleep, some might not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. \"Only humans are asleep.\"\n   We don't have information about which types of beings might be asleep.

This isn't necessarily a contradiction, so we can't determine Lewis's type just from this.\n\nHowever, we know Lewis is happy, and we're told \"A human is happy.\" This suggests Lewis is human, but doesn't definitively prove it since the statement doesn't say only humans are happy.\n\nFor statements 3 and 4 about Lewis seeing donkeys, we don't have direct information.\n\nLooking at statement 2 more carefully: \"No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey\"\n- The first part is true\n- For the second part, we need to determine if Lewis is a donkey\n\nSince no donkeys saw Lewis, if Lewis were a donkey, he wouldn't see himself. This isn't necessarily contradictory.\n\nHowever, we know there's at least one donkey. If Lewis were a monkey, there would be no contradiction. If Lewis were a human, there would be no contradiction.

Since \"Every human chased Alfred,\" Alfred cannot be a human (as humans don't chase themselves in this scenario). So Alfred is either a donkey or a monkey.\n\nLet's consider the statement \"A human saw Alfred if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n- If Alfred is a donkey: Then Alfred chased a human (since every donkey chased a human). This means a donkey (Alfred) chased Alfred, making \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" false. By the biconditional, \"A human saw Alfred\" must also be false.\n- If Alfred is a monkey: We don't have direct information about whether donkeys chased Alfred or whether humans saw Alfred.\n\nWe also know \"It is not the case that Lewis is happy.\" This tells us Lewis exists and is not happy.

This means for each monkey, there is at least one donkey that both kicked the monkey and was kicked by the monkey.\n- This directly implies that at least one donkey kicked at least one monkey, and at least one monkey kicked at least one donkey.\n\nFrom this, I can immediately determine:\n- Statement 5 \"A donkey kicked a monkey\" must be true, since every monkey was kicked by a donkey that it also kicked.\n- Statement 6 \"No donkeys kicked a monkey\" must be false, contradicting what we just established.\n\nFor the remaining statements:\n- Statement 1: \"A donkey kicked every monkey\" - Not necessarily true. We only know each monkey was kicked by some donkey, not that there's one donkey that kicked all monkeys.\n- Statement 2: \"Every donkey kicked a monkey\" - Not necessarily true. Some donkeys might not have kicked any monkeys.\n- Statement 3: \"No donkeys kicked every monkey\" - Not necessarily true. It's possible one donkey kicked all monkeys.\n- Statement 4: \"Every donkey kicked every monkey\" - Not necessarily true.

This is because if Hazel were a donkey, then Hazel would have seen Hazel, which would mean all donkeys saw Hazel (since there would only be one donkey, Hazel). But we're told not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n\nSince Hazel is not a donkey, Hazel must be either a human or a monkey.\n\nFrom \"Hazel chased every donkey,\" we know statement 2 must be true if there's at least one donkey. Since we're told there's at least one of each type, statement 2 \"Hazel chased a donkey\" is definitely true.\n\nFrom \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel,\" we know the antecedent of the conditional \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then (every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is hungry)\" is true. Therefore, the consequent \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is hungry\" must also be true.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. \"Not all donkeys chased Hazel\" - We don't have information about which donkeys chased Hazel, if any. This might be true, but it's not necessarily true.\n\n2. \"Hazel chased a donkey\" - As established above, this is true because there's at least one donkey and Hazel chased every donkey.\n\n3. \"Every donkey chased Hazel\" - We don't have information about which donkeys chased Hazel, if any. This might be true, but it's not necessarily true.\n\n4. \"A donkey chased Hazel\" - We don't have information about which donkeys chased Hazel, if any.

This might be true, but it's not necessarily true.\n\n6. \"Hazel is hungry\" - We know \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is hungry\" is true. But this doesn't necessarily mean Hazel is hungry. It only means that if every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel is hungry.

So this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. \"Alfred and Hazel are happy.\"\n   We know Alfred is happy, but we have no information about whether Hazel is happy.

This establishes a symmetrical \"saw\" relationship between humans.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. \"A human saw every human that saw it.\"\n   This is directly given in the problem statement, just rephrased from \"every human\" to \"a human.\" Since every human has this property, at least one human must have it.\n   Therefore, statement 1 must be true.\n\n2. \"Every human saw every human.\"\n   This doesn't necessarily follow. The original statement only establishes that if human A saw human B, then human B saw human A. But it doesn't require that every human saw every other human.\n   \n3. \"A human saw a human.\"\n   We know there's at least one human. If there are at least two humans, and if any human saw any other human, then this would be true. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state that any human saw any other human.\n   \n4. \"Every human saw a human.\"\n   Similar to #3, this isn't necessarily true based on the given information.\n   \n5. \"A human saw every human.\"\n   This isn't necessarily true based on the given information.\n   \n6. \"No humans saw every human.\"\n   This isn't necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nLooking more carefully at statement 3: \"A human saw a human.\"\nIf there are at least two humans (which the problem implies), and if the \"saw\" relationship is non-empty among humans, then this would be true. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that any human saw any other human.\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, I realize that the statement \"Every human saw every human that saw it\" would be vacuously true if no human saw any human. Since the problem is presenting this as a meaningful constraint, it implies that some seeing between humans does occur.\n\nTherefore, statement 3 must be true.\n\nFinal answer: Statements 1 and 3 must be true in this situation.",

In an impossible situation, any statement can be proven true (principle of explosion).\n\nHowever, I'll analyze what we can determine before reaching the contradiction:\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that every donkey chased Alfred, which means statement 3 \"A donkey chased Alfred\" must be true (since we're told there's at least one donkey).\n\nFrom statement 3, we can determine that Alfred drank if and only if Alfred is a human.\n\nFinal answer: Statement 3 \"A donkey chased Alfred\" and statement 6 \"Alfred drank\" (assuming Alfred is human) must be true in this situation.

This statement could be true or false.\n\n4. \"No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey\" - The first part \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is given as true. However, we have no information about whether Lewis is a donkey or not. This statement could be true or false.\n\n5. \"Lewis saw every donkey\" - We have no information about who Lewis saw. This statement could be true or false.\n\n6. \"Every donkey saw Lewis\" - This contradicts our given information that \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n## Final answer:\nStatement 2: \"Not all donkeys saw Lewis\" must be true, as it follows directly from the given information that no donkeys saw Lewis.",

This doesn't tell us whether Hazel is a donkey, human, or monkey.\n\nLet's examine each statement:\n\n1. **\"A donkey chased a human.\"**\n   This requires at least one human to have chased a donkey, which would then cause that donkey to chase the human. But we don't know if any human chased any donkey.\n\n2. **\"Every donkey chased every human.\"**\n   This would only be true if every human chased every donkey, which we don't know.\n\n3. **\"No donkeys chased every human.\"**\n   We can't determine this from the given information.\n\n4. **\"Every donkey chased a human.\"**\n   This would only be true if every donkey was chased by at least one human, which we don't know.\n\n5. **\"A donkey chased every human.\"**\n   This would only be true if every human chased at least one donkey, which we don't know.\n\n6. **\"A donkey chased every human that chased it.\"**\n   This is directly implied by the given statement \"Every donkey chased every human that chased it.\" If every donkey does this, then certainly at least one donkey does this.\n\n## Final Answer:\nStatement 6 is the only statement that must be true: \"A donkey chased every human that chased it.\"",

We have no direct information about whether any donkey chased all humans. The given conditions don't force this to be true.\n\n2. \"Every donkey chased a human.\"\nFrom the third condition, we know every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey. But this doesn't guarantee that every donkey chased some human.\n\n3. \"No humans chased every donkey.\"\nFrom the first condition, no donkeys chased a human that chased it. This means if a human chases a donkey, that donkey cannot chase that human. But if a human chased every donkey, then no donkey could chase that human. However, from the third condition, every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey. This creates a contradiction if any human chased every donkey. Therefore, no human can chase every donkey.\n\n4. \"No donkeys chased a human.\"\nThis contradicts the fifth condition, which states a monkey chased a donkey that chased a human. So this statement is false.\n\n5. \"No donkeys chased every human.\"\nWe don't have enough information to determine if this must be true.\n\n6. \"Every donkey chased every human.\"\nWe don't have enough information to determine if this must be true.\n\nAfter careful analysis, statement 3 \"No humans chased every donkey\" must be true. If any human chased every donkey, then by condition 3, every donkey would chase this human. But this would violate condition 1, which states no donkeys chased a human that chased it.\n\nFinal answer: Statement 3 \"No humans chased every donkey\" must be true.",

This creates a \"seeing\" relationship between monkeys that is symmetric.\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n\nOption 5: \"A monkey saw a monkey.\"\nThis must be true from statement 2. Since there's at least one monkey, and every monkey saw a monkey that saw it, there must be at least one monkey that saw another monkey.\n\nOption 6: \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\"\nThis contradicts statement 2 and must be false.\n\nFor the remaining options, I need to determine if the \"seeing\" relationship among monkeys is more specific than just symmetric pairs.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know every monkey must see at least one other monkey (that also sees it). This doesn't necessarily mean every monkey sees every other monkey, or that there's a monkey that every monkey saw, or that no monkey sees every monkey.\n\nThe \"seeing\" relationship could be satisfied by pairs of monkeys seeing each other, or by all monkeys seeing each other, or various other arrangements.\n\nSince no other information constrains the \"seeing\" relationship among monkeys beyond what's in statement 2, I cannot definitively determine that options 1, 2, 3, or 4 must be true.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: Option 5 \"A monkey saw a monkey\" is the only statement that must be true in this situation.",

This immediately tells us:\n\n- Statement 3 \"A donkey saw Alfred\" must be false\n- Statement 5 \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" is misleading - it's not just that some donkeys didn't see Alfred, but actually NO donkeys saw Alfred\n\nLet's examine each statement:\n\n1. \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" - This contradicts our given information that no donkeys saw Alfred. So this is false.\n\n2. \"Alfred saw a donkey\" - Nothing in our premises tells us whether Alfred saw a donkey or not. This could be true or false.\n\n3. \"A donkey saw Alfred\" - This directly contradicts \"No donkeys saw Alfred.\" So this is false.\n\n4. \"Alfred is asleep\" - Nothing in our premises tells us whether Alfred is asleep. This could be true or false.\n\n5. \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" - While technically true (since no donkeys saw Alfred), this statement suggests that some donkeys saw Alfred, which is false. However, strictly logically speaking, \"not all X did Y\" is true whenever \"no X did Y\" is true.\n\n6. \"Alfred saw every donkey\" - Nothing in our premises tells us whether Alfred saw any or all donkeys. This could be true or false.\n\n## Final Answer:\nStatement 5 \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" is the only statement that must be true in this situation.

Since every monkey chased every monkey, each monkey chased monkeys that chased it.\n\n2. \"There is not a monkey that every monkey chased.\"\n   This is FALSE. Since every monkey chased every monkey, all monkeys were chased by every monkey.\n\n3. \"No monkeys chased every monkey.\"\n   This is FALSE. Since every monkey chased every monkey, each monkey chased all monkeys.\n\n4. \"A monkey chased every monkey.\"\n   This is TRUE.

Since we've established Hazel isn't human, this statement must be false.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a human.**\n   We've established this must be true based on our analysis.\n\n4. **Hazel is a human.**\n   We've established Hazel cannot be human, so this statement is false.\n\n5. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.**\n   This is the same as statement 2, just written differently. It's a contradiction and must be false.\n\n## Final Answer:\nStatement 3, \"Hazel isn't a human,\" is the only statement that must be true in this situation.",

This immediately tells us that statement 6 is true: \"There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\" In fact, every donkey is chased by every monkey.\n\nFor the other statements, I need to determine if donkeys chase monkeys.\n\nFrom \"A donkey chased a human that chased it,\" we know there exists at least one donkey (let's call it D1) and one human (H1) where D1 chased H1 and H1 chased D1. But this doesn't tell us anything about donkeys chasing monkeys.\n\nThe statements about Hazel and Lewis don't provide clear information about donkeys chasing monkeys either.\n\nSince we only know that monkeys chase donkeys, but have no information requiring donkeys to chase monkeys, statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 (which all assert that some or all donkeys chase some or all monkeys) are not necessarily true.\n\nStatement 2 says \"No donkeys chased every monkey.\" This could be true if donkeys don't chase monkeys at all, or if each donkey chases some but not all monkeys. Since we have no information requiring donkeys to chase monkeys, this statement is not necessarily true either.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is:\n6. There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n\nFinal answer: Statement 6 is the only statement that must be true.",

Since we know Hazel isn't a human, this would require Hazel to be both human and not human. FALSE.\n\n5. \"Hazel isn't a human.\" - TRUE, we determined this earlier.\n\n6. \"Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\" - FALSE, because Alfred isn't hungry (though Lewis is).\n\nThe final answer is: Statement 5 \"Hazel isn't a human\" must be true in this situation.",

If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\nLet's focus on statement 3: \"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\"\n\nThis means: For any donkeys x and y, if y chased x, then x chased y. This creates a symmetrical chasing relationship among donkeys - if any donkey chases another donkey, then the chase is mutual.\n\nNow, let's examine statement 5: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n\n\"Just in case\" means logical equivalence (if and only if). So this statement means:\n- \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true if and only if \"No donkeys chased Alfred\" is true.\n- These statements can only be equivalent if there are no donkeys that chased Alfred, because if even one donkey chased Alfred, then \"No donkeys chased Alfred\" would be false while \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" could still be true.\n\nNow I'll evaluate each of the possible answers:\n\n1. \"No donkeys chased every donkey\" - Not necessarily true. We don't have enough information.\n\n2. \"Every donkey chased every donkey\" - Not necessarily true. We know the chasing relationship is symmetrical, but we don't know if any chasing occurs.\n\n3. \"A donkey chased a donkey\" - Not necessarily true. We don't know if any chasing occurs.\n\n4. \"Every donkey chased a donkey\" - Not necessarily true. We don't know if any chasing occurs.\n\n5. \"A donkey chased every donkey that chased it\" - This must be true. From statement 3, we know that every donkey chased every donkey that chased it. Since there is at least one donkey (from the first premise), there exists a donkey that chased every donkey that chased it.\n\n6. \"A donkey chased every donkey\" - Not necessarily true. We don't have enough information.\n\nThe final answer is: Statement 5 \"A donkey chased every donkey that chased it\" must be true.",

However, if even one donkey is in set X, then that donkey would be chased by every donkey, contradicting our premise.\n\nTherefore, set X must be empty, meaning no donkey chased every human.\n\nChecking the options:\n1. \"A donkey chased a human\" - We can't determine this\n2. \"A donkey chased every human\" - False (as we just proved)\n3. \"Every donkey chased a human\" - We can't determine this\n4. \"Every donkey chased every human\" - False (as we just proved)\n5. \"No donkeys chased every human\" - True (as we just proved)\n6. \"No donkeys chased a human\" - We can't determine this\n\nThe final answer is option 5: \"No donkeys chased every human.\"",

We know both of these are true (from points 4 and 2), but the statement suggests they're logically connected, which isn't established in the premises.\n\n5. \"Alfred will run\" - We have no information about whether Alfred runs, so this isn't necessarily true.\n\n6. \"A human saw Alfred if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred\" - This claims an equivalence between \"a human saw Alfred\" and \"no donkeys chased Alfred\". We know \"a human saw Alfred\" is true, but we only know \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" - which is different from \"no donkeys chased Alfred\".\n\nLooking at statement 4 more carefully: \"A human saw Alfred just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred\" - both parts of this statement are independently true from our premises.

We have no information about humans chasing donkeys, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n   This is a logical contradiction (it can't be both true that \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" AND \"every monkey kicked Lewis\").

Since only donkeys are hungry, Lewis is not hungry.\n\n**Alfred**: \"A monkey kicked Alfred\" tells us something about Alfred but not what Alfred is. We don't have direct information about Alfred's type yet.\n\n**Hazel**: We have the statement \"Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"P only if Q\" which means P\u2192Q or \"If Hazel isn't a human, then every donkey saw Hazel.\"\n\nLet's see if we can determine more about Alfred:\nWe know \"If a donkey kicked Hazel, then Alfred isn't a human.\" But we don't know if a donkey kicked Hazel, so we can't conclude anything about Alfred from this statement alone.\n\nLooking at the options, the only thing we can definitively conclude is:\n- Lewis is not a donkey\n- Only donkeys are hungry\n- Therefore, Lewis is not hungry\n\nSo option 6, \"Lewis isn't hungry,\" must be true.\n\nFor Alfred, we don't have enough information to determine whether he's a donkey (and thus hungry) or not.\n\nMy final answer is: Statement 6 (Lewis isn't hungry) must be true.",

This is false.\n\n3. \"Every donkey kicked every monkey.\"\n   Again, since no donkeys kicked any monkeys, this is false.\n\n4. \"There is not a monkey that every donkey kicked.\"\n   This is equivalent to saying \"No monkey was kicked by every donkey.\" Since no donkeys kicked any monkeys, no monkey was kicked by any donkey, let alone every donkey. This statement is true.\n\n5. \"Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.\"\n   This is a logical contradiction. \"Every human is asleep\" and \"not all humans are asleep\" cannot both be true or both be false simultaneously.

Therefore, every monkey saw Hazel. This must be true.\n\n2. \"Hazel saw every monkey\" - We have no information about whether Hazel saw any monkeys.

We don't know if Hazel ate or if any monkey saw Alfred.\n\n3. \"Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" - UNKNOWN. We know all monkeys ate, but we don't know if Alfred sees Hazel.\n\n4. \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a monkey ate\" - UNKNOWN. We know a monkey ate (since every monkey ate), but we don't know if Alfred sees Hazel.\n\n5. \"Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred\" - TRUE. This is directly stated in our given information.\n\n6. \"If a monkey saw Alfred, then Hazel ate\" - UNKNOWN. We don't know if any monkey saw Alfred or if Hazel ate.\n\n## Final Answer:\nStatement 5 is the only statement that must be true: \"Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred.\"",
