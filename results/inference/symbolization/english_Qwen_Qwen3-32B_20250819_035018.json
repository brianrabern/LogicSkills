            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is \"Hazel saw Alfred and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" The abbreviations given are P for \"saw\", c for Hazel, a for Alfred, M for \"is a donkey\", and Q for \"kicked\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into two parts connected by \"and\". The first part is \"Hazel saw Alfred\", and the second part is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\". \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Hazel saw Alfred\". Using the abbreviation P, which is [1] saw [2], so Hazel (c) is the subject, and Alfred (a) is the object. That translates directly to Pca. \n\nNow the second part: \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\". The phrase \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" would be formalized as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa), meaning for every x, if x is a donkey, then x kicked Alfred. But since it's \"not all\", we need to negate that universal quantifier. The negation of \u2200x(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to \u2203x(A \u2227 \u00acB). So applying that here, it becomes \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). \n\nPutting the two parts together with \"and\", which is the logical conjunction \u2227. So the entire formula should be Pca \u2227 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). \n\nLet me double-check. The original sentence says Hazel saw Alfred (so Pca is correct) and it's not the case that all donkeys kicked Alfred. The negation of \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is indeed \"there exists a donkey who did not kick Alfred\". So the second part is correctly translated as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). \n\nSo combining them with \u2227, the final formula should be Pca \u2227 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just confirm the abbreviations again. Yes, c is Hazel, a is Alfred. Mx is x is a donkey, Qxa would be x kicked Alfred. The negation is correct. Quantifiers are properly used. The structure is correct. Alright, that should be the right formalization.\n</think>\n\nPca \u2227 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is: \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are Q for kicked, a for Alfred, c for Hazel, N for human, L for hungry, and P for saw.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then [some complex statement].\" The complex statement is \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" \n\nBreaking down the complex part: \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the statement is \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" So maybe it's structured as \"If there are no hungry humans, then every human saw Hazel\"? Wait, no. Wait, \"no humans are hungry\" is the antecedent of the \"only if\". Let me recall that \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B, where A is the statement before \"only if\". So if the sentence is \"No humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel,\" then A is \"no humans are hungry\" and B is \"every human saw Hazel.\" Therefore, it would translate to A \u2192 B. \n\nSo the complex part is \"No humans are hungry \u2192 every human saw Hazel.\" \n\nBut the entire original sentence is \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then [that implication].\" So the overall structure is \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)) ) ] ?\n\nWait, let me check. \"No humans are hungry\" can be formalized as \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx). And \"every human saw Hazel\" is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nSo the complex part is (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 [ \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)) ].\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different way to parse \"only if\". Let me think again. The original sentence is \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" Let me rephrase this as \"The absence of hungry humans holds only if all humans saw Hazel.\" So \"only if\" here is setting a condition for the absence of hungry humans. So that would be equivalent to: If there are no hungry humans, then all humans saw Hazel. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo the complex part is (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nNow, putting it all together. The entire sentence is \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then [that implication].\" So the main connective is an implication where the antecedent is \u00acQ(a,c) and the consequent is the implication we just formed.\n\nSo the formula is \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)) ].\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes implications can be rearranged. Let me check if there's a way to simplify or rephrase this. Alternatively, perhaps the entire consequent can be considered as a material implication. So the structure is correct as it is.\n\nBut maybe we can rephrase the inner implication. The inner implication is \"If there are no hungry humans, then every human saw Hazel.\" So that's (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)). \n\nAlternatively, the contrapositive of this implication would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx). But I don't think that's necessary here. The original translation seems okay.\n\nNow, let's check if all abbreviations are used correctly. Q is [1] kicked [2], so Q(a,c) is Alfred kicked Hazel. The negation is \u00acQ(a,c). The rest seems correct.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nBut in formal syntax, we need to make sure the quantifiers are properly scoped. Let me write it with the proper parentheses:\n\n\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 ( (\u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)) )\n\nBut since the user wants it in standard predicate logic syntax, using the abbreviations as given (with the terms like Qac, etc.), I can write it without the parentheses around the terms, assuming the standard precedence. However, to avoid ambiguity, it's better to include parentheses where necessary.\n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check again for any possible mistakes. The original sentence is a conditional where the antecedent is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" and the consequent is a conditional between \"no humans are hungry\" and \"every human saw Hazel\". The translation captures that structure. The use of the abbreviations is correct. Quantifiers are properly applied. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))",

The sentence is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis or every donkey kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviations are M for \"is a donkey,\" Q for \"kicked,\" and b for Lewis. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. It seems like a disjunction between two parts: \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" and \"every donkey kicked Lewis.\" So the structure is A or B, where A is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" and B is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" In logic, \"Not all\" translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. So \"All donkeys kicked Lewis\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). Therefore, the negation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb) by moving the negation inside, but since the original sentence uses \"Not all,\" maybe keeping it as \u00ac\u2200 is better unless there's a reason to convert it. However, the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax, so either form might be acceptable. But the original sentence is structured as \"Not all...\", so maybe it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200.\n\nThen B: \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" is straightforward: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb).\n\nSo the entire sentence is A \u2228 B, which would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nWait, but that seems like a tautology. Because \"Not all...\" or \"All...\" would be equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 P, which is always true. But maybe the original sentence is structured that way. Let me check the original again. The sentence is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis or every donkey kicked Lewis.\" So yes, it's exactly \u00acP \u2228 P, where P is \"All donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Therefore, the formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb). \n\nBut in predicate logic, this is a valid formula, so even though it's a tautology, it's correct. The user didn't mention avoiding tautologies, so I think that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether I can recognize that the disjunction combines these two statements. So the answer should be the disjunction of the two parts as described. \n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any other possible interpretations? For example, could \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" be interpreted as \"Some donkeys did not kick Lewis\"? But that's exactly what \u00ac\u2200x(...) is equivalent to. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, combining them with a disjunction, the formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence between \u00ac\u2200 and \u2203\u00ac, but I think the problem expects using the negation of the universal quantifier directly here unless specified otherwise. Since the example used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), I think keeping it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) is better.\n\nSo the final formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb).\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\u2228\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If every human is asleep, then [something].\" So the outermost form is probably an implication. Let's start with the antecedent: \"every human is asleep.\" Using the abbreviations, N(x) is \"x is a human\" and J(x) is \"x is asleep.\" So the antecedent would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx). Got that.\n\nNow the consequent is trickier: \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" Let's parse that. The phrase \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So in this case, the \"A\" is \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis,\" which is \u00acR(b, b), since R is \"chased\" and b is Lewis. The \"B\" part is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" \n\n\"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be the negation of \"all donkeys saw Hazel.\" The statement \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Px c), since M is \"donkey,\" P is \"saw,\" and c is Hazel. So the negation is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc), but maybe the problem expects the negation of the universal quantifier as is. \n\nPutting the \"only if\" together: \u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). \n\nSo the entire implication is: [\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)] \u2192 [\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc)].\n\nWait, but in formal logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, maybe we can write the consequent as a material implication. Let me check again. The original consequent is \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So yes, the consequent is \u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nBut wait, there might be a variable conflict here. The consequent has a \u2200x, but the antecedent also has a \u2200x. However, in formal logic, variables are bound within their quantifiers, so the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent are separate. So that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to use different variables for clarity, but the problem says to use the abbreviations given and standard syntax. Since the x in the consequent is a separate quantifier, it's acceptable. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc))\n\nBut wait, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Let me check if I need to adjust the variables to avoid confusion. For example, in the consequent, the existential quantifier (if I rewrite \u00ac\u2200x as \u2203x\u00ac...) might use a different variable, but the problem didn't specify to avoid variable reuse. Since the original uses x in both, but they are bound in different scopes, it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the consequent's universal quantifier to be written as \u2200y or something else, but since the user's example uses x again, perhaps it's acceptable. \n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acRbb\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc))\n\nBut let me check again. Let me write it with parentheses properly. The main implication is between the antecedent and the consequent. The consequent is itself an implication. So the whole formula is:\n\n(\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nYes, that's correct. I think that's the proper formalization.

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The main structure is a conditional: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred will run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, the antecedent of the main conditional is \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, using the quantifier negation rule, this can be rewritten as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). Either form is correct, but maybe the original is clearer here. However, depending on how the rest of the sentence is structured, maybe using the negation directly is better.\n\nNow the consequent is \"Alfred will run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" part is important. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, \"Alfred will run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" becomes Fa \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxhc)). Wait, the abbreviation for Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\". So Hazel is the second argument. Since the monkeys are the ones kicking Hazel, the Q would be Qxh (since x is the monkey, and Hazel is h). Wait, the abbreviation says Q: [1] kicked [2]. So if a monkey x kicked Hazel (c?), wait the abbreviations say c is Hazel. Let me check the abbreviations again.\n\nAbbreviations:\nN: [1] is a human\nJ: [1] is asleep\nF: [1] will run\na: Alfred\nO: [1] is a monkey\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\nc: Hazel\n\nSo Hazel is c. So \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). Because Q's first argument is the kicker (monkey x), and the second is Hazel (c). So Qxc means x kicked c (Hazel). Therefore, \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc), which is equivalent to \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc).\n\nSo putting the consequent together: Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). Alternatively, since \"only if\" is a material implication, the whole consequent is Fa \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x...). \n\nNow, the entire main conditional is: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc)]. Alternatively, using the existential form for the antecedent. Wait, \u00ac\u2200x(...) is equivalent to \u2203x(...) where we negate the inner. So \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). But maybe it's better to keep it as the negation of the universal for clarity unless there's a reason to switch. \n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc))\n\nBut we need to make sure that variables are properly renamed if there's a conflict. Wait, in the antecedent, the variable x is bound by the universal quantifier, and in the consequent, the existential quantifier also uses x. But since they are in different scopes, it's okay. However, to avoid confusion, maybe we should use different variables. Let me check. \n\nIn the antecedent, \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) is the same as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). The consequent has \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). If we leave the x as is, it's okay because each quantifier is in a separate scope. But when writing the entire formula, the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent are different variables (due to scoping). However, in the final formula, we need to ensure that variables are properly bound. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the entire formula as:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nBecause \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc) is equivalent to \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). Either form is acceptable, but maybe using the universal quantifier is better here to avoid confusion with the existential. Let me think. The original statement says \"no monkeys kicked Hazel,\" which is a universal statement over monkeys. So \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) might be more straightforward. \n\nSo putting it all together, the main formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nBut here, the variable x is used in both the antecedent and the consequent. However, in predicate logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers, so even if the same variable name is used, they are different variables in different scopes. However, to avoid confusion, it's better to use different variables. For example, in the antecedent, we can use x, and in the consequent, use y. Let me adjust that. \n\nSo the antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). The consequent's inner part is \u2200y(Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc). Therefore, the entire formula becomes:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc))\n\nThis way, the variables x and y are distinct, avoiding any possible confusion. \n\nNow, let's check if this captures the original sentence correctly. The original says: If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred will run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel. \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Not all humans are asleep: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx)\n- Alfred will run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel: Fa \u2192 \u2200y(\u00ac(Oy \u2227 Qyc)) which is equivalent to Fa \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc)\n\nSo the entire implication is correct. \n\nAnother thing to check is that \"only if\" is correctly translated. Since \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B, here A is Fa and B is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\", which is \u2200y(Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc). So yes, the consequent is Fa \u2192 B. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc))\n\nAlternatively, using the same variable in the consequent is acceptable, but renaming to y makes it clearer. \n\nSo I think this is the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(Fa\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192\u00acQyc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the main structure of the sentence is a conditional: \"If Alfred won't attack, then [complex part].\" So the overall form is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [something]. \n\nNow, the \"something\" is \"every monkey saw Lewis only if every monkey is asleep.\" Let's parse that. The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, for each monkey, if they saw Lewis, then they must be asleep. Wait, but the original says \"every monkey saw Lewis only if every monkey is asleep.\" Hmm. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me rephrase the part after the \"then\": For every monkey, if they saw Lewis, then every monkey is asleep. Wait, that might not make sense. Because if one monkey saw Lewis, then all monkeys are asleep? That seems odd, but maybe that's how the logic works here. Alternatively, maybe the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey saw Lewis\" conditional on \"every monkey is asleep.\" Let me think.\n\nThe original is: \"every monkey saw Lewis only if every monkey is asleep.\" So this could be read as: If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is asleep. Because \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So, (for all monkeys x, P(x, b)) \u2192 (for all monkeys x, J(x)). \n\nBut another interpretation might be that for each monkey, if they saw Lewis, then they are asleep. But the original uses \"every monkey saw Lewis\" as a whole condition. The wording is \"only if every monkey is asleep.\" So the entire \"every monkey saw Lewis\" is the antecedent, and \"every monkey is asleep\" is the consequent. Because \"only if\" typically links the entire antecedent to the consequent. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So in this case, A is \"every monkey saw Lewis,\" and B is \"every monkey is asleep.\" Therefore, the implication would be (\u2200x (O(x) \u2192 P(x, b))) \u2192 (\u2200x (O(x) \u2192 J(x))). Wait, but \"every monkey saw Lewis\" is already a universal statement. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nThe phrase \"every monkey saw Lewis\" is \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 P(x, b)). Because for every x, if x is a monkey, then x saw Lewis. Similarly, \"every monkey is asleep\" is \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 J(x)). So the \"only if\" part would be that if the first is true, then the second must be true. So the implication is [\u2200x (O(x) \u2192 P(x, b))] \u2192 [\u2200x (O(x) \u2192 J(x))]. \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u00acG(a), then [\u2200x (O(x) \u2192 P(x, b)) \u2192 \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 J(x))]. \n\nBut wait, the structure here is that the main conditional is \u00acG(a) \u2192 (A \u2192 B), where A is \"every monkey saw Lewis\" and B is \"every monkey is asleep.\" So the entire formula would be \u00acG(a) \u2192 [\u2200x (O(x) \u2192 P(x, b)) \u2192 \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 J(x))]. \n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, using the fact that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But maybe it's better to write it directly as given. \n\nAlternatively, the \"only if\" part could be treated as a biconditional, but no, \"only if\" is a one-way implication. So I think the correct translation is as above. \n\nLet me check again. The original sentence: If Alfred won't attack, then (every monkey saw Lewis only if every monkey is asleep). The \"only if\" part is \"every monkey saw Lewis only if every monkey is asleep,\" which is equivalent to \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is asleep.\" So the entire implication after the \"then\" is that if the antecedent (every monkey saw Lewis) holds, then the consequent (every monkey is asleep) must hold. Therefore, the inner part is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x,b)) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx). \n\nTherefore, the whole formula is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x,b)) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)]. \n\nBut in predicate logic, we can write this as \u00acG(a) \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x,b))) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) ). \n\nNow, I need to check if there's any way this could be misinterpreted. For example, maybe the scope of the quantifiers? But since the quantifiers are in the same form for both parts, it should be okay. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x,b)) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) )\n\nAlternatively, since the x in the two universal quantifiers are bound variables, we can use the same variable or different ones, but since they are in separate scopes, it's okay to reuse x. \n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x,b)) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) )\n\nBut in standard notation, using the symbols as given. The abbreviations are correct here: G is for \"[1] will attack\", so G(a) is \"Alfred will attack\". The negation is \u00acG(a). O is \"[1] is a monkey\", P is \"[1] saw [2]\", b is Lewis, J is \"[1] is asleep\". \n\nYes, that seems right. I don't see any errors in this translation.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) )",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure is \"A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\" The phrase \"just in case\" usually translates to a biconditional (\u2194), meaning that the happiness of the human is equivalent to the condition that no donkeys chased Alfred. \n\nLooking at the abbreviations: N is \"[1] is a human\", K is \"[1] is happy\", M is \"[1] is a donkey\", R is \"[1] chased [2]\", and a is Alfred. \n\nSo the sentence is saying that for any human (N), their being happy (K) is equivalent to there being no donkeys (M) that chased Alfred (a). \n\nBreaking it down, the left side of the biconditional is \"A human is happy.\" Since it's a general statement about all humans, I should start with a universal quantifier over x. So \u2200x (Nx \u2192 ...). Wait, but the original sentence is \"A human is happy...\" which sounds like a universal statement. But then the right side is about no donkeys chasing Alfred. So maybe it's \u2200x (Nx \u2194 Kx)? No, wait, the structure is \"A human is happy just in case...\", which is more like \"For all x, if x is a human, then x is happy if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\" Wait, maybe the \"just in case\" applies to the entire condition. Let me think again.\n\nThe original sentence: \"A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\" So, for any human, their happiness is exactly when no donkeys chased Alfred. So, for all x, if x is a human, then (Kx \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Ry a)). \n\nWait, but \"A human is happy\" might be interpreted as a universal statement. Like, all humans are happy if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred. Wait, but that would be different. Let me check. If the sentence was \"Every human is happy if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred,\" then it would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Kx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Ry a). But that's not the case here. The original sentence is structured as \"A human is happy just in case...\", which sounds like for each human, their being happy is equivalent to the condition. So it's more like \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Kx \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Ry a))). \n\nBut wait, does that make sense? If there's a human, then their happiness depends on whether any donkey chased Alfred. But if there are multiple humans, they all have their happiness dependent on the same condition. So if no donkeys chased Alfred, then all humans are happy, and if any donkey chased Alfred, then no humans are happy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a biconditional between being a human and being happy, but that doesn't fit. Let me check the structure again. The sentence says \"A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\" The \"just in case\" here is indicating a biconditional between the human's happiness and the absence of donkeys chasing Alfred. So, for any human x, Kx (x is happy) is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Rya). \n\nSo the formalization would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Kx \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Rya))). \n\nLet me check the abbreviations again. N is \"[1] is a human\", K is \"[1] is happy\", M is \"[1] is a donkey\", R is \"[1] chased [2]\", a is Alfred. \n\nYes, so for all x, if x is a human (Nx), then x is happy (Kx) if and only if there does not exist a y such that y is a donkey (My) and y chased Alfred (Rya). \n\nSo the formula would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Kx \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y (M y \u2227 R y a))). \n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the correct quantifiers and structure. The key is that the biconditional is between Kx and the negation of the existence of chasing donkeys. Also, since the original sentence is about \"a human\" in general, it's a universal statement over all humans. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me write it out with the symbols properly. The final formula should be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 (Kx \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Rya))).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192(Kx\u2194\u00ac\u2203y(My\u2227Rya)))",

        },
        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the sentence and understand its structure. The sentence is: \"If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nThe abbreviations provided are:\n- R: [1] chased [2]\n- b: Lewis\n- N: [1] is a human\n- c: Hazel\n- O: [1] is a monkey\n- Q: [1] kicked [2]\n\nSo, breaking down the sentence:\n\nThe main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the wording here might need careful analysis. Let me rephrase the original sentence. It says, \"If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" part is a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So the entire structure is: If (not Rbb), then (N(x) \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)).\n\nWait, let me think again. The original sentence after the \"if\" is a conditional where the consequent is \"a human chased Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So, the consequent is \"if a human chased Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So the overall structure is: \u00acRbb \u2192 [ (N(x) \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac(\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)) ] ?\n\nBut wait, \"a human chased Hazel\" would require that there exists a human who chased Hazel. Wait, but the wording is \"a human chased Hazel only if...\" So, the \"only if\" applies to the existence. Let me think.\n\nIn English, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the statement is \"A human chased Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel,\" then that would translate to: If there exists a human who chased Hazel, then it is the case that no monkeys kicked Hazel. So, \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). Alternatively, \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc), which might be equivalent.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u00acRbb, then [ \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) ].\n\nNow, formalizing this in predicate logic. The main connective is an implication with the antecedent being \u00acRbb and the consequent being the implication between the existence of a human chasing Hazel and the negation of monkeys kicking Hazel.\n\nSo the formula would be: \u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes it's preferable to use universal quantifiers where possible. Let me check if I can rephrase the consequent implication. The consequent is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). Which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2228 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc), but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, using the contrapositive or other forms. But I think the direct translation is acceptable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the scope of the quantifiers. The consequent is an implication where the antecedent is an existential quantifier, and the consequent is a universal statement (since \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) is equivalent to \u2200y (\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acQyc), which is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc)). So perhaps writing it as \u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc) )\n\nBut the problem allows using the abbreviations as given, and the user hasn't specified to minimize quantifiers or anything. So either form is acceptable. However, the original statement uses \"no monkeys kicked Hazel,\" which is straightforwardly \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). So I think the first version is correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications associate to the right, so we might need parentheses. Let me check the syntax. The main operator is the implication between \u00acRbb and the rest. The rest is another implication between \u2203x... and \u00ac\u2203y... So the formula is:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) )\n\nAlternatively, since implications are right-associative, maybe we can write it without some parentheses, but it's safer to include them for clarity.\n\nSo the final formalization would be:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc))\n\nI need to make sure that all the abbreviations are used correctly. Let me verify:\n\n- Lewis didn't chase Lewis: \u00acRbb (since R is [1] chased [2], so Rbb is Lewis chased Lewis, and the negation is \u00acRbb).\n\n- A human chased Hazel: \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc). Correct, because there exists an x that is a human (Nx) and x chased Hazel (Rxc, since c is Hazel).\n\n- No monkeys kicked Hazel: \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). Because Oy is [y] is a monkey, Qyc is [y] kicked Hazel. So there does not exist a y that is a monkey and kicked Hazel.\n\nSo the entire formula is correct. Now, check if there's any possible mistake. For example, is the \"only if\" correctly captured? The original says \"a human chased Hazel only if no monkeys...\", which is \u2203x... \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y... So yes.\n\nAnother possible way is to write the consequent as \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc), which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). So either form is acceptable, but since the user provided Q as [1] kicked [2], using the existential form with negation is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the formalization is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRbb\u2192(\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxc)\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(Oy\u2227Qyc))",

The main structure is a conditional: \"If every human is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the first part of the sentence: \"If every human is asleep.\" Using the abbreviations, N(x) means \"x is a human,\" and J(x) means \"x is asleep.\" So \"every human is asleep\" translates to \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequence part: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" is \u00acQ(a, c), since Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\" and a is Alfred, c is Hazel. The \"only if\" part connects this to \"no humans are hungry.\" \n\n\"No humans are hungry\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx), where L(x) is \"x is hungry.\" So putting the \"only if\" together: \u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). \n\nBut wait, the entire consequence is conditional on the first part. So the whole statement is: If [every human is asleep], then [\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)]. \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nBut let me check if I need to adjust the quantifiers. The inner \u2200x in the consequence might conflict with the outer \u2200x. To avoid variable capture, perhaps I should use different variables. Wait, in predicate logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers, so even if they have the same name, they're different if bound in different scopes. But maybe it's better to use a different variable for clarity, though the problem doesn't specify that. The original uses x in both places, so perhaps that's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the inner \u2200x is okay as is. Let me confirm: the outer quantifier is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx), and the inner part is \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Since the outer x is bound in its own scope, and the inner x is bound in its own scope, they are separate. So the formula is correct as written.\n\nAnother thing to check: the translation of \"only if\". The original sentence says \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" So if we let A be \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" and B be \"no humans are hungry,\" then A only if B translates to A \u2192 B. So that's correct. \n\nSo the entire formalization should be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nI need to make sure that all abbreviations are used correctly. N for human, J for asleep, Q for kicked, a and c for the individuals, L for hungry. Yes, that's all correct. \n\nAnother possible consideration: Could the \"only if\" part be part of a biconditional? No, because \"only if\" is one-directional. For example, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B, whereas \"if and only if\" is a biconditional. The sentence here uses \"only if,\" so it's a one-way implication. \n\nSo I think the final formula is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx))",

First, I need to parse the sentence: \"If not all donkeys will run, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are M for donkey, F for will run, P for saw, a for Alfred, O for monkey, Q for kicked, and c for Hazel.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"If not all donkeys will run.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys will run\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). So \"not all donkeys will run\" is the negation of that, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) because the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential with the negated implication. But maybe the original form is better here for the implication structure.\n\nThe second part is the then clause: \"Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is that if Alfred saw Alfred, then it's the case that no monkeys kicked Hazel. \n\nBreaking down \"Alfred saw Alfred\": that's Pa a, since P is [1] saw [2], and both are Alfred. \n\nThen \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" means that for all x, if x is a monkey, then x did not kick Hazel. So \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQx c). \n\nPutting the \"only if\" together: Pa a \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQx c).\n\nSo the entire implication is: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 (Pa a \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQx c)).\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's a way to simplify or restructure. Let me confirm each part again.\n\nOriginal sentence structure: If [not all donkeys run], then [Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel]. \n\nYes, so the main connective is the implication between the two parts. The antecedent is the negation of \"all donkeys will run,\" and the consequent is the \"only if\" statement.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the \"only if\" translates directly to an implication where the consequent is the \"no monkeys...\" part. So the consequent of the main implication is Pa a \u2192 (forall x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc)).\n\nTherefore, combining everything, the entire formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 (Pa a \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nBut I need to make sure that the quantifiers are correctly placed. Also, check if the scope of the negation is correct. The antecedent is indeed the negation of the universal statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using the existential form for \"not all,\" but in logic, both forms are equivalent. However, since the example uses the universal form with negation, perhaps it's better to stick with \u00ac\u2200x(...) here. \n\nAlso, check if there's any ambiguity in the original sentence. The \"only if\" part is straightforward. \n\nSo the final formula should be as above.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem. The sentence is \"A monkey chased a human that chased a donkey.\" The abbreviations given are O for monkey, N for human, M for donkey, and R for chased.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The main structure is that there's a monkey who chased a human. But that human, in turn, chased a donkey. So it's like a chain: monkey \u2192 human \u2192 donkey, each chasing the next.\n\nSince it's using \"a monkey\" and \"a human,\" these are existential quantifiers. So I need to use \u2203 for both. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \"A monkey chased a human.\" That would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Rxy)). But then there's more: the human that was chased also chased a donkey. So the human (y) must have chased a donkey (z). So the inner part for y should include that y is a human who chased a donkey. Therefore, the entire formula would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Rxy \u2227 \u2203z (Mz \u2227 Ryz))))?\n\nWait, but maybe I can structure it more efficiently. Let me see. The human that the monkey chased is the same human who chased a donkey. So the existential for y (the human) needs to include both being chased by the monkey and chasing a donkey. So it's \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2203y (N(y) \u2227 R(x,y) \u2227 \u2203z (M(z) \u2227 R(y,z))))). \n\nYes, that seems right. The monkey x chases human y, and human y chases donkey z. Each existential quantifier introduces a new variable. So the order is monkey, then human, then donkey. Each with their respective predicates. The connectives are all conjunctions because we're asserting the existence of each entity with their properties and the chasing relations.\n\nI need to make sure that all the variables are properly quantified. So x is a monkey, y is a human, z is a donkey. Each exists such that the chasing happens in sequence. \n\nLet me check if there's any need for universal quantifiers here. No, because the original sentence uses indefinite articles (\"a monkey\", \"a human\", \"a donkey\"), which in predicate logic translate to existential quantifiers. \n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the structure correctly captures that the same human is both chased by the monkey and chasing the donkey. By nesting the existentials properly, that's handled. The y in the middle is bound by its own existential, and within that, the z for the donkey. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formula should be:\n\n\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Rxy \u2227 \u2203z (Mz \u2227 Ryz)))\n\nAlternatively, since existential quantifiers can be nested, maybe we can write it as \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz). But does that capture the same meaning? Let's see. If we have all three existentials at the front, it would mean there exists a monkey, a human, and a donkey such that the monkey chased the human and the human chased the donkey. That's equivalent because the original structure requires the existence of each with the relations. So both forms are acceptable. However, sometimes nesting them might be preferred for clarity, but in predicate logic, the scope is such that moving the quantifiers to the front is allowed as long as the variables are properly bound. \n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Either way is correct, but perhaps the nested version is more faithful to the original sentence's structure. However, since all the variables are existentially quantified, it's acceptable to have them all at the front. Let me check the example given. In the example, they used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So quantifiers can be at the front. For existentials, same thing. So maybe the more concise way is to have all the quantifiers upfront. Wait, but the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. In standard syntax, you can have multiple quantifiers at the beginning. So perhaps the correct formalization is \u2203x \u2203y \u2203z (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz). But maybe the order of variables matters? Let me think. The original sentence is a monkey chased a human (so Rxy) that chased a donkey (Ryz). So the variables x, y, z would be monkey, human, donkey. So Ox, Ny, Mz. Therefore, the formula would be \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz). \n\nBut in the initial breakdown, I had nested existentials. However, in predicate logic, \u2203x (A \u2227 \u2203y (B \u2227 \u2203z (C))) is equivalent to \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z (A \u2227 B \u2227 C), assuming A doesn't mention y or z, etc. So yes, they are equivalent. Therefore, both forms are correct, but the example uses a single quantifier with nested implications. However, in this case, since we have multiple existentials, perhaps the more standard way is to have all the quantifiers upfront. \n\nBut the example uses a universal quantifier with an implication. For existentials, when you have multiple, you can either nest them or put them all at the front. Since the problem says to use standard syntax, and standard syntax allows multiple quantifiers, I think the answer would be better written with multiple \u2203 symbols. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"return a single well-formed formula in standard predicate logic syntax.\" So using multiple \u2203 is allowed. Let me check the example again. The example uses \u2200x(...\u2192...). So in that case, the quantifier is at the front. For our case, if we have multiple existentials, they can all be at the front. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the variables don't need to be all quantified at the front. But in predicate logic, you can write it either way. However, to match standard practice, it's better to have all quantifiers at the beginning. \n\nSo I think that's the correct approach. Let me verify once more. The original sentence asserts the existence of a monkey, a human, and a donkey, with the chasing relations between them. Therefore, the formula should be \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz). \n\nYes, that seems correct. The abbreviations are O, N, M, R as given. So variables x, y, z are used. Each has their respective predicates. The relations Rxy (monkey chased human) and Ryz (human chased donkey). \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(Ox \u2227 Ny \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz). \n\nAlternatively, using the nested structure as in the example. But the example had a universal quantifier and an implication. In our case, with existentials and conjunctions, putting all quantifiers upfront is more straightforward. \n\nYes, I think that's the right way. Let me check if there's any possibility of ambiguity. Suppose if there were more variables or different scopes, but here it's straightforward. Each existential introduces a new variable, and all conditions are conjunctions. \n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(Ox \u2227 Ny \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" So the overall form is \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, \"only if\" can be tricky. Let me recall that \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So the entire sentence is structured as: If (every monkey saw Lewis), then (Hazel kicked Alfred \u2192 not all donkeys kicked Hazel).\n\nNow, let's handle each part. Starting with the antecedent of the main conditional: \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, O is [1] is a monkey, P is [1] saw [2], and b is Lewis. So \"every monkey saw Lewis\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb). That's straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" Let's parse this. The \"only if\" here means that Hazel kicking Alfred (which is Qc a, since Q is [1] kicked [2], c is Hazel, a is Alfred) implies that not all donkeys kicked Hazel. \n\nThe \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" part is the negation of \"all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" \"All donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx c), since M is [1] is a donkey, and Q is [1] kicked [2], so Qx c means x kicked Hazel. Therefore, the negation is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx c). Alternatively, this can be written as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx c) by moving the negation inside, but maybe the problem expects the negation of the universal quantifier as is.\n\nPutting it together, the consequent is Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx c). \n\nSo the entire formula would be: \n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx c))\n\nBut I need to check if the quantifiers are properly scoped. Let me make sure that in the consequent, the \"not all donkeys...\" is correctly represented. Yes, \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc). Wait, Qx c is [x] kicked [c], which is correct because the donkey (x) kicked Hazel (c). \n\nLet me check the abbreviations again to make sure. Q: [1] kicked [2], so for \"donkeys kicked Hazel\", it's [donkey] kicked [Hazel], so Qx c. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main conditional is:\n\nIf [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)] then [Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc)]\n\nTherefore, the formalization is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nI need to make sure that variables are properly named. The first \u2200x is for monkeys, and the second \u2200x is for donkeys. Since variables are bound, it's okay to reuse x in different scopes. So that's acceptable in predicate logic.\n\nAnother way to write the consequent's negation is using an existential quantifier: \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc). But the problem says to use the standard logical symbols, and since the example uses \u2200 and \u2203 as needed, I think either form is acceptable. However, since the original statement says \"not all\", it's more direct to translate that as \u00ac\u2200..., so I'll stick with that.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nWait, I need to check the order of the arguments in Q. Q is [1] kicked [2]. So when it's \"donkeys kicked Hazel\", the first argument is the donkey (x), and the second is Hazel (c). So Qxc. But in the consequent's negation, it's \"donkeys kicked Hazel\", so yes, Qxc. But in the consequent, the original is \"Hazel kicked Alfred\" which is Qca (Hazel is c, Alfred is a; c kicked a). Correct.\n\nSo all abbreviations are used properly. Let me check again:\n\n- O: monkey\n- P: saw (so Pxb is x saw b (Lewis))\n- Q: kicked (Qca is c kicked a; Qxc is x kicked c)\n- M: donkey\n- c: Hazel\n- a: Alfred\n- b: Lewis\n\nYes, all correct. So the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192(Qca\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc))\n\nI think that's it. Let me just make sure there are no parentheses issues. The main conditional is between the first part and the entire consequent. The consequent is itself a conditional. So the structure is (A \u2192 (B \u2192 C)), which requires parentheses around the inner conditional. So yes, the formula is correctly structured.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192(Qca\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc))",

The sentence is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B.\" So A is \"a human chased Lewis,\" and B is \"Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate.\" \n\nStarting with A: \"a human chased Lewis.\" The abbreviation for human is N (N: [1] is a human). The chasing is represented by R: [1] chased [2]. Since it's \"a human,\" that implies there exists at least one human who chased Lewis. So A would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), because \"a human\" is an existential quantifier, and Lewis is denoted by b.\n\nNow for B: \"Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. But here, P is \"Lewis won't run\" and Q is \"no donkeys ate.\" Wait, let me make sure. The original statement is \"Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate.\" So, if Lewis doesn't run, then it must be that no donkeys ate. So B is Fb' \u2192 (no donkeys ate). Wait, \"Lewis won't run\" is \u00acFb, since F is [1] will run. So the structure is \u00acFb \u2192 (no donkeys ate). \n\nNow, \"no donkeys ate\" means that there are no donkeys that ate. Using the abbreviations, M is [1] is a donkey, and I is [1] ate. So \"no donkeys ate\" is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Alternatively, it could be written as \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Both are equivalent, but maybe the universal quantifier is more straightforward here.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), then (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx)). \n\nSo the formalization would be: \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx)). \n\nWait, let me check if I got the direction of the implication right. The original says \"Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate.\" As per logic, \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. Here, P is \"Lewis won't run\" (\u00acFb) and Q is \"no donkeys ate\" (the \u2200x part). So yes, \u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is: \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx)). \n\nI should make sure there's no ambiguity in the quantifiers. The \"a human\" is an existential, and the \"no donkeys\" is a universal. Also, the variables are properly scoped. The x in \u2203x is bound there, and the x in \u2200x is bound in its scope. Since they are different scopes, using the same variable x is acceptable, but maybe using different variables would be better? Wait, in predicate logic, variables can be reused as long as they are bound correctly. So the formula is okay as written. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second \u2200x could use a different variable, like \u2200y, but since the user didn't specify variable names, it's acceptable to use x again as long as it's bound. So the final formula should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192(\u00acFb\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acIx))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is \"Not all donkeys drank if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"is a donkey,\" H for \"drank,\" O for \"is a monkey,\" P for \"saw,\" and b for Lewis.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a biconditional (if and only if) between two parts: \"Not all donkeys drank\" and \"No monkeys saw Lewis.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all donkeys drank.\" In predicate logic, \"All donkeys drank\" would typically be expressed as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx). The negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx). However, sometimes \"not all\" can also be expressed as \"there exists at least one donkey that did not drink,\" which would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acHx). I need to check if these two are equivalent. The negation of a universal quantifier does distribute into the implication, so \u00ac\u2200x(A\u2192B) is equivalent to \u2203x(A \u2227 \u00acB). So both forms are equivalent here. So for the first part of the biconditional, either form is acceptable, but perhaps using the existential quantifier is more straightforward here.\n\nNext, the second part: \"No monkeys saw Lewis.\" This translates to \"For all x, if x is a monkey, then x did not see Lewis.\" So that would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb). Alternatively, it can also be written as \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Pxb), which is the negation of \"there exists a monkey who saw Lewis.\" Both forms are logically equivalent, but again, using the universal quantifier might be more direct here.\n\nNow, the entire sentence is a biconditional between these two parts. So combining them with \u2194. Therefore, the structure is:\n\n[\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx)] \u2194 [\u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb)]\n\nBut let me verify if that's correct. Let me rephrase the original sentence again. \"Not all donkeys drank if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis.\" So the biconditional connects the negation of \"all donkeys drank\" with the negation of \"some monkeys saw Lewis.\" Since \"no monkeys saw Lewis\" is equivalent to \"it is not the case that some monkeys saw Lewis,\" which is the same as \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb). \n\nAlternatively, using the existential form for the first part and the universal for the second. Let me think again. The first part, \"Not all donkeys drank,\" is equivalent to \"There exists a donkey who did not drink,\" which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acHx). The second part, \"No monkeys saw Lewis,\" is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb). So the biconditional would be (\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acHx)) \u2194 (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb)).\n\nBut wait, the original sentence uses \"if and only if,\" so both directions must hold. So when the first part is true (some donkey didn't drink), then the second must be true (no monkeys saw Lewis), and vice versa. \n\nNow, I need to make sure that I'm using the correct abbreviations. Let me check the abbreviations again:\n\n- M: [1] is a donkey\n- H: [1] drank\n- O: [1] is a monkey\n- P: [1] saw [2]\n- b: Lewis\n\nYes, that's correct. So for \"donkey drank,\" it's Mx and Hx. For \"monkeys saw Lewis,\" it's Ox and Pxb. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the formalization should be:\n\n(\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acHx)) \u2194 (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb))\n\nAlternatively, if I use the negated universal for the first part, it would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb). Both are equivalent, but perhaps the problem expects one form over the other. Let me check standard practice. Typically, \"not all\" is often expressed as the negation of a universal, but since \u00ac\u2200x(A\u2192B) is equivalent to \u2203x(A \u2227 \u00acB), both are acceptable. However, the problem might prefer using the existential form because it's more direct. However, in the example provided, they used the negation of the universal for \"Not all\" (though in the example, it was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which became \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). The example's negation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), but in the given problem, the first part is \"Not all donkeys drank,\" which would be the negation of \u2200x(Mx\u2192Hx). However, in the example, the user's answer was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is straightforward. So maybe in this case, the problem expects using the negation of the universal for \"Not all.\"\n\nBut which is more standard? In logic, both forms are correct. However, for the sake of consistency with the example, perhaps the problem expects using the negated universal. Wait, the example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which is a universal. The current problem's first part is the negation of a universal. But in the example, the formalization was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the problem's first part is \"Not all donkeys drank,\" then it's \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Hx). However, another way is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acHx). Both are correct. Which one should I use here? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Since the abbreviations for \"drank\" is H: [1] drank, so perhaps using the existential is better here. Because \"Not all donkeys drank\" can be read as \"There exists a donkey who didn't drink,\" which would use the existential. However, the problem's example uses the universal form for \"Every,\" so maybe the problem expects the negation of the universal. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem says \"Not all donkeys drank\" which is the negation of \"All donkeys drank.\" So if \"All donkeys drank\" is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Hx), then \"Not all donkeys drank\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Hx). So that would be the first part. The second part is \"No monkeys saw Lewis,\" which is \u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00acPxb). Therefore, the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Hx) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00acPxb). \n\nBut another way to write \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Hx) is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acHx). So which is better? Both are logically equivalent. However, the problem may prefer one form over the other. Since the example uses the universal form, maybe the problem expects the same here. But I need to check if there's any reason to prefer one over the other. For instance, in some contexts, using the existential might be more straightforward. However, since the example uses the universal form, perhaps the problem expects that approach here. Let me go with the negation of the universal for the first part. \n\nTherefore, the final formula would be:\n\n(\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Hx)) \u2194 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb))\n\nAlternatively, using the existential:\n\n(\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acHx)) \u2194 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb))\n\nBoth are correct. Which one is more appropriate? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Let me check the abbreviations again. The abbreviations don't specify any particular form, so both are acceptable. However, in formal logic, when translating \"not all,\" it's common to use the negation of the universal quantifier. For example, \"Not all A are B\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Ax\u2192Bx). So perhaps that's the expected form here. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb)\n\nBut to make sure, let's check if the biconditional is correctly placed. The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys drank if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis.\" So the entire statement is a biconditional between the two parts. Therefore, the formula should have the biconditional between the two translated parts. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nNow, I need to present this in the correct syntax. Using the standard symbols, with proper parentheses. Also, making sure that variables are properly bound. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb)\n\nAlternatively, with parentheses for clarity:\n\n(\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Hx)) \u2194 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb))\n\nBut since the problem requires a single well-formed formula, and the example uses no parentheses except those necessary for the structure. Let's check the example again: \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). The example doesn't have parentheses around the entire formula, but since it's a single quantifier, it's okay. In our case, the biconditional is between two quantified formulas. So we need to ensure that the biconditional is between the two, so parentheses might be necessary. However, in standard predicate logic syntax, the scope of quantifiers extends as far to the right as possible. But since we have two separate quantified formulas connected by \u2194, we need to make sure that each quantifier is properly scoped. \n\nLet me think: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx) is one formula, and \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb) is another. Connecting them with \u2194 would require that each is a complete formula. Therefore, the formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb)\n\nThis should be correct. However, in some notations, parentheses might be added for clarity, but the problem's example doesn't use them. So following the example's style, it's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects parentheses around each quantified formula, but I think that's not necessary here. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb)\n\nAlternatively, using the existential form:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acHx) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb)\n\nBut which one is correct? Let me check again. Since the problem says \"Not all donkeys drank,\" which is equivalent to both \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx) and \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acHx). Both are correct. However, in the example, the user formalized \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if we follow that, then \"Not all donkeys drank\" would be the negation of that structure, hence \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Hx). Therefore, using that form would be consistent with the example. \n\nTherefore, I will go with \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hx) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb).\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Hx)\u2194\u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00acPxb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. \n\nThe sentence is: \"If every human is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the structure. The main structure is a conditional (\"If... then...\") where the consequent is another conditional (\"only if\"). \n\nSo, the overall form is: If A, then (B only if C). \n\nIn logic, \"only if\" is typically translated as a material implication. So \"B only if C\" becomes B \u2192 C. Therefore, the entire sentence would be structured as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C).\n\nNow, let's identify each part:\n\nA: Every human is asleep.\nB: Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\nC: Every monkey is hungry.\n\nLet's translate each part using the given abbreviations.\n\nStarting with A: \"Every human is asleep.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a human\" is N, and \"[1] is asleep\" is J. So, for all x, if Nx then Jx. That's \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx).\n\nNext, B: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] kicked [2]\" is Q. Alfred is a, Hazel is c. So, the negation of Qac. That's \u00acQac.\n\nC: \"Every monkey is hungry.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a monkey\" is O, and \"[1] is hungry\" is L. So, for all x, if Ox then Lx. That's \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx).\n\nPutting it all together, the main formula is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C), which translates to:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the quantifiers. The variables in the antecedent and consequent are separate. The first part uses x, and the second part also uses x, but they are separate. However, in predicate logic, when we have multiple quantifiers, they can reuse variables as long as they are bound correctly. However, to avoid confusion, perhaps we should use different variables. But since the problem says to return a single well-formed formula, and the variables are bound, it's acceptable. For example, the first \u2200x is for humans, the second \u2200x is for monkeys. But in the formula, they are separate, so the x in the consequent is a new variable. Wait, no\u2014actually, the second \u2200x is inside the implication. So the formula would be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Ly))\n\nBut maybe the problem allows using the same variable. However, in standard logic, it's allowed because each quantifier binds its own variable. So even if they are both x, they are different scopes. But to prevent confusion, using different variables is better. However, the problem doesn't specify that variables need to be distinct, just to return a well-formed formula. \n\nBut in the example given, they used the same variable in different quantifiers. For example, in the example, \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), so they used x again if needed. So perhaps it's acceptable here. Therefore, the formula can be written as:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nBut in some logical systems, reusing the same variable in nested quantifiers is allowed. However, in this case, the two quantifiers are in different parts of the formula. The first is the antecedent, and the second is in the consequent. So they are separate. Therefore, the formula is valid.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formalization would be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nBut wait, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Let me check the abbreviations again to make sure:\n\nN: [1] is a human\nJ: [1] is asleep\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\na: Alfred\nc: Hazel\nO: [1] is a monkey\nL: [1] is hungry\n\nYes, that's correct. So the parts are translated correctly. \n\nAnother thing to check is the structure. The original sentence says \"If every human is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" The \"only if\" part is crucial. So \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry\" is equivalent to \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey is hungry.\" Wait, no. Wait, \"only if\" is the other way around. Let me recall: \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So if the statement is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry,\" that would be \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). So the consequent of the main implication is that \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(...). Therefore, the entire formula is the antecedent (every human is asleep) implies that (\u00acQac \u2192 ...). \n\nYes, that's correct. So the main structure is correct. \n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nBut since the problem requires using the abbreviations and proper syntax, I need to make sure there are no typos. Also, the variables in the second universal quantifier could be a different letter, but as discussed, it's acceptable to reuse x. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be as written.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Lewis is hungry only if every monkey is asleep.\" The abbreviations provided are M for donkey, P for saw, c for Hazel, L for hungry, b for Lewis, O for monkey, J for asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" and B is \"Lewis is hungry only if every monkey is asleep.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, using the equivalence, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc). So either form is acceptable, but maybe the negated universal is more direct here. However, since the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax, I think using the negated universal is okay.\n\nNow for B: \"Lewis is hungry only if every monkey is asleep.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So in this case, \"Lewis is hungry only if every monkey is asleep\" becomes Lb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx). Because \"every monkey is asleep\" is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx). So the entire B part is Lb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire conditional is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Lb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)).\n\nWait, but sometimes people prefer to avoid implications in the antecedent by using equivalences. Let me check if there's another way. The original is \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then (Lewis is hungry only if every monkey is asleep).\" The main connective is the implication between the two parts. So the structure is A \u2192 B, where A is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) and B is Lb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, could B be rephrased? Let me confirm: \"Lewis is hungry only if every monkey is asleep\" is equivalent to \"If Lewis is hungry, then every monkey is asleep.\" Yes, that's right. So B is indeed Lb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx).\n\nSo combining them, the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Lb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)). Alternatively, since implications can be nested, that's acceptable. I don't think there's a need to simplify further unless there's a specific requirement, but the problem says to use standard syntax, so this should be okay.\n\nLet me check for any possible mistakes. Did I use the abbreviations correctly? M is [1] is a donkey, so Mx. P is [1] saw [2], so Pxc where c is Hazel. L is [1] is hungry, so Lb since b is Lewis. O is [1] is a monkey, so Ox. J is [1] is asleep, so Jx. So yes, all abbreviations are correctly applied.\n\nAnother thing to check: the scope of quantifiers. In \"every monkey is asleep,\" it's \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx). Correct. And the \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc) would also work, but the problem allows either form as long as it's well-formed. Since the example used \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), using the negated universal here is consistent with the example's approach.\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Lb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)). I need to make sure that the parentheses are correctly placed to avoid ambiguity. The implication is between the negated universal and the entire B part, which itself is an implication. So parentheses around the B part are necessary.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc)\u2192(Lb\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Jx))",

The sentence to formalize is: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Alfred will run only if every monkey is hungry.\" The abbreviations provided are M for donkey, P for saw, c for Hazel, F for will run, a for Alfred, O for monkey, and L for hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then [consequent].\" The consequent is \"Alfred will run only if every monkey is hungry.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc) because the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential quantifier with the negated implication. But I'll stick with the negation of the universal for now unless there's a reason to switch.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Alfred will run only if every monkey is hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" in logic usually translates to an implication where the necessary condition is the consequent. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Here, Alfred running (Fa) is the antecedent, and the consequent is \"every monkey is hungry,\" which is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly). So the consequent becomes Fa \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is: \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly)). \n\nWait, but I should check if there's any variable conflict. The antecedent uses x, and the consequent uses y. Since they are bound variables, it's okay. Also, the abbreviations are correctly applied: Mx for donkey, Pxc for x saw Hazel (c), Fa for Alfred (a) will run, Oy for monkey, Ly for hungry.\n\nLet me double-check the \"only if\" part. The original sentence says Alfred will run only if every monkey is hungry. So if Alfred runs, then every monkey must be hungry. That's correctly captured by Fa \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly). \n\nSo the final formula should be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Ly)). \n\nI need to make sure that all the quantifiers are properly placed and that the variables are correctly bound. The antecedent is a negated universal, leading to an existential, but I left it as \u00ac\u2200x... which is acceptable. The consequent uses an implication for \"only if,\" which seems right. Also, the variables x and y are distinct, so there's no clash. \n\nYes, this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc)\u2192(Fa\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192Ly))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is: \"If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no donkeys ate.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. So A is \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis,\" and B is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no donkeys ate.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" The abbreviation for \"chased\" is R, where R is [1] chased [2]. Since both the subject and object are Lewis, which is represented by b, this would be \u00acRbb. Because it's the negation of R applied to b and b.\n\nNow B: \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no donkeys ate.\" Let's break this down. The phrase \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b), since O is [1] is a monkey, and Q is [1] kicked [2], so x kicked Lewis (b). \n\nBut then there's the \"only if no donkeys ate\" part. The \"only if\" suggests that the kicking happens only when the condition (no donkeys ate) is true. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is translated as P \u2192 Q. So the entire B part would be that if a monkey kicked Lewis, then it must be that no donkeys ate. \n\nBut \"no donkeys ate\" is the negation of \"there exists a donkey that ate.\" The abbreviation for donkey is M (Mx: x is a donkey) and I is [1] ate. So \"no donkeys ate\" is \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). \n\nPutting that together, the entire B part is \u2200x [(Ox \u2227 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)]. Wait, but \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if...\" So maybe it's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qx b \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))). Because for every monkey x, if x kicked Lewis, then no donkeys ate. That seems right. \n\nSo combining A and B with the conditional: \u00acRbb \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qx b \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)))]. \n\nWait, but the original sentence says \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no donkeys ate.\" So \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" part. Hmm, maybe another way to look at it is that the entire \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is the antecedent of the \"only if.\" But that would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). But that would mean if all monkeys kicked Lewis, then no donkeys ate. However, the original sentence says \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no donkeys ate,\" which is equivalent to saying that for each monkey, if they kicked Lewis, then no donkeys ate. So the previous approach with moving the implication inside the universal quantifier is correct. \n\nSo the final formula would be \u00acRbb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qx b \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))). \n\nNow, simplifying the existential quantifier: \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) is equivalent to \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy). So maybe we can write it as \u00acRbb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qx b \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy))). But the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The original abbreviations for I is [1] ate, so \"no donkeys ate\" is \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). So either form is acceptable. \n\nBut the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. So perhaps the first version is better. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal B: every monkey kicked Lewis only if no donkeys ate. \n\nThe structure is: For every monkey x, if x kicked Lewis, then no donkeys ate. So \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qx b \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acRbb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qx b \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))). \n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence, we can write \u00acRbb \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)). But that would be a different structure. Let me think. \n\nThe original sentence says \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if...\" So the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" statement. In that case, it would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). But the way the sentence is phrased is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if...\", which is similar to \"If every monkey kicked Lewis, then no donkeys ate.\" \n\nBut the original sentence is a bit ambiguous. However, the phrase \"only if\" usually connects two propositions. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So in this case, the A is \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" and B is \"no donkeys ate.\" Therefore, the entire B part would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). \n\nBut the problem is that the original sentence says \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no donkeys ate.\" So that would translate to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). \n\nBut then the entire conditional would be \u00acRbb \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)]. \n\nBut this is different from the previous approach where the implication was inside the universal quantifier. Which is correct?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose there are two monkeys. The first interpretation says that for each monkey, if they kicked Lewis, then no donkeys ate. So if even one monkey kicked Lewis, then no donkeys ate. The second interpretation says that if all monkeys kicked Lewis, then no donkeys ate. These are different. \n\nThe original sentence is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no donkeys ate.\" The wording \"only if\" here is likely connecting the entire \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" to the \"no donkeys ate.\" So it's like saying \"If every monkey kicked Lewis, then no donkeys ate.\" Therefore, the correct translation would be the second approach. \n\nBut how to parse that? The structure is: If (\u00acRbb), then [ (every monkey kicked Lewis) \u2192 (no donkeys ate) ].\n\nSo the formula would be \u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) ). \n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes people prefer to have the quantifiers properly scoped. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the structure is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 ...). \n\nIn our case, the second part would be: if \u00acRbb, then (if \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb), then ...). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to rephrase the implication using logical equivalences. Because A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. \n\nSo \u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) ) is equivalent to (\u00acRbb \u2227 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). \n\nBut the problem says to return a well-formed formula in standard syntax. Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the original way is better. \n\nBut which interpretation is correct? The original sentence says \"If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no donkeys ate.\" \n\nThe \"only if\" is part of the consequent of the main conditional. So the main structure is: If A, then (B only if C). Which translates to: If A, then (B \u2192 C). So the entire formula is \u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) ). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) ). \n\nBut to write this in standard syntax, we need to make sure the parentheses are correctly placed. \n\nSo the final formula is: \u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qx b)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) )\n\nBut checking the abbreviations again: \n\n- R: [1] chased [2]\n- b: Lewis\n- O: [1] is a monkey\n- Q: [1] kicked [2]\n- M: [1] is a donkey\n- I: [1] ate\n\nYes, so Qx b is correct (x kicked Lewis). \n\nSo putting it all together: \n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) )\n\nAlternatively, since the problem may prefer to have the negation of the existential as a universal, but the problem says to use the abbreviations given, and the abbreviations for I is [1] ate. So \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) is acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) )\n\nBut written with proper symbols and spacing. Let me check the example again. The example used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So no space between the quantifier and the variable. Similarly, connectives are written with no space. So the formula would be:\n\n\u00acRbb\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb)\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(My\u2227Iy))\n\nBut in the example, they used parentheses appropriately. Also, in standard syntax, the implication arrows are used with parentheses to clarify scope. \n\nYes, this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRbb\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb)\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(My\u2227Iy))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The main structure is a conditional: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Lewis won't run only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the antecedent and the consequent. The antecedent is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc), where Mx is \"x is a donkey\" and Pxc is \"x saw Hazel (c).\" So \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is the negation of that, which becomes \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, using the quantifier negation rule, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc). But since the original uses \"not all,\" maybe it's clearer to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(...).\n\nNow the consequent is \"Lewis won't run only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The phrase \"A only if B\" is logically equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, \"Lewis won't run\" is \u00acFb (since F is \"will run\" and b is Lewis). Therefore, \"Lewis won't run only if every monkey kicked Lewis\" translates to \u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qyb). Here, Oy is \"y is a monkey\" and Qyb is \"y kicked Lewis (b).\"\n\nPutting the whole conditional together: The entire statement is \"If [antecedent], then [consequent].\" So the structure is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qyb)). \n\nWait, but in formal logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if I need to use parentheses correctly. Yes, the consequent is itself an implication, so the main connective is the implication from the antecedent to that inner implication. So the formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qyb))\n\nAlternatively, I can also write the consequent as \u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qyb), and the antecedent as the negation of the universal. \n\nLet me check if there are any other abbreviations to use. The abbreviations provided are M for donkey, P for saw, c for Hazel, F for will run, b for Lewis, O for monkey, Q for kicked. All variables are properly accounted for. \n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers are correctly scoped. The antecedent uses x (donkeys), and the consequent uses y (monkeys), which is fine since they are separate quantifiers. \n\nAnother thing to check: the original sentence says \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\" That's \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qyb). Correct. \n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qyb))\n\nAlternatively, using the quantifier negation, it's equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc) \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qyb)), but the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard symbols. Since the original uses \"not all,\" maybe the first form with \u00ac\u2200 is better. \n\nYes, the instructions say to use standard logical symbols, and \u00ac\u2200 is acceptable. So the answer should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc)\u2192(\u00acFb\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192Qyb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If Alfred will run, then Lewis won't run only if every human saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are F for [1] will run, a for Alfred, b for Lewis, N for [1] is a human, P for [1] saw [2], and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional seems to be \"If Alfred will run, then [something].\" The \"something\" here is \"Lewis won't run only if every human saw Hazel.\" Let me break that down.\n\nThe phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So \"Lewis won't run only if every human saw Hazel\" would be \u00acFb \u2192 (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)). Wait, no. Let me think again. If we have \"Lewis won't run only if every human saw Hazel,\" that would mean that Lewis not running is conditional on every human having seen Hazel. So the structure is \u00acFb \u2192 (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))? Or is it the other way around? Wait, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So here, A is \"Lewis won't run\" (\u00acFb), and B is \"every human saw Hazel\" (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)). Therefore, the \"only if\" translates to \u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nSo the entire sentence is \"If Alfred will run, then [that implication].\" So the main structure is F a \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)).\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be chained. Also, sometimes \"if A then (B only if C)\" can be written as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So that would be the same as A \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x...). So that seems correct.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to interpret it. The original sentence is \"If Alfred will run, then Lewis won't run only if every human saw Hazel.\" So the \"only if\" is part of the consequent of the main conditional. Therefore, the formalization would indeed be F a \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)).\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations. F is for [1] will run. So Fa is \"Alfred will run,\" Fb is \"Lewis will run.\" The negation of Fb is \"Lewis won't run.\" The part about every human saw Hazel: every x such that Nx (x is a human) must satisfy Pxc (x saw Hazel). So that's \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nPutting it all together: F a implies that if \u00acFb then \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc). So the formula is F a \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)).\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. So this is a valid well-formed formula. Let me make sure there are no parentheses issues. The main connective is the implication between Fa and the rest. The rest is another implication between \u00acFb and the universal quantifier. So parentheses are correctly placed.\n\nI think that's the correct formalization. Let me double-check the original sentence again. The structure is: If A, then (not B only if C). Which translates to A \u2192 (\u00acB \u2192 C). Which is equivalent to A \u2192 (\u00acB \u2192 C). So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final formula should be F a \u2192 (\u00acF b \u2192 \u2200x (N x \u2192 P x c)).\n</think>\n\nFa\u2192(\u00acFb\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"Alfred is happy and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. There are two parts connected by \"and\": \"Alfred is happy\" and \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Alfred is happy.\" The abbreviation for being happy is K, which is [1] is happy. Since Alfred is the subject, this would translate to Ka. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the second part: \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" The negation of \"all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"all monkeys kicked Lewis\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b), because O is [1] is a monkey, and Q is [1] kicked [2], with Lewis being b. So the negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b). Alternatively, I remember that the negation of a universal quantifier can be expressed as an existential quantifier with the negated inner part. So \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP. Applying that here, it would become \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQx b). Wait, is that right? Let me check. The original statement is \"all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b). The negation is \"There exists a monkey who did not kick Lewis,\" which is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQx b). So yes, that's correct. So the second part is \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b) or equivalently \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQx b). But the problem says to use standard syntax, so maybe it's better to write it as the negation of the universal statement unless instructed otherwise. But both are equivalent. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided, so I need to make sure I use the correct structure. The original sentence says \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is a direct negation of the universal statement. So perhaps it's better to write it as \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). But sometimes, in logic, it's preferable to push the negation inside, but the problem doesn't specify that. Since the example given uses the universal quantifier with implication, maybe we should stick with that structure here. So the second part would be \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is the conjunction of Ka and \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b). So the formalization would be Ka \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b). Let me check the abbreviations again to make sure I didn't mix up any letters. K is [1] is happy, a is Alfred, so Ka is correct. O is [1] is a monkey, Q is [1] kicked [2], and b is Lewis. So Qxb would be \"x kicked b (Lewis)\", which is correct. So the entire formula is Ka \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nWait, but the example uses the implication for \"all\" statements. For example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So following that pattern, \"all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb), so the negation is \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). Therefore, the entire formula is Ka \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nI think that's correct. Let me make sure there are no other interpretations. Another way to think about \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is \"some monkeys did not kick Lewis,\" which would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). But the problem allows either form as long as it's well-formed. However, the example uses the universal quantifier with implication for the \"all\" case, so the negation would be the direct negation of that. Unless the problem requires a specific form, but since it's asking for a well-formed formula, both are correct. But perhaps the expected answer is the negation of the universal, as that's the direct translation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the existential form. Wait, let me think again. The original sentence is \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" In English, \"not all\" is logically equivalent to \"some... not,\" but in formal logic, depending on how you structure it. However, since the example uses the universal quantifier for \"every,\" the user might expect the same approach here. So the answer would be Ka \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the existential form. Let me check with an example. Suppose \"Not all students passed.\" If \"all students passed\" is \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), then \"not all students passed\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), which is equivalent to \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx). Both are correct, but the problem's example uses the universal form for the positive statement, so the negation would be the negation of that. Therefore, the answer should use \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nTherefore, the final formula is Ka \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). Let me double-check the abbreviations again. K is for happy, a is Alfred. O is monkey, Q is kicked, b is Lewis. Yes. So the formula is correct.\n</think>\n\nKa \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"[1] is a donkey\" and G for \"[1] will attack\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The phrase \"unless\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A unless B\" is often translated as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\", or equivalently \"A \u2228 B\". But here, the structure is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" So the \"unless\" connects the two parts: the first part is \"Not all donkeys will attack\" and the second is \"every donkey will attack\". \n\nLet me rephrase the sentence: If it is not the case that every donkey will attack, then not all donkeys will attack. Wait, that seems a bit circular. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that the only way for all donkeys to not attack is if every donkey does attack. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nThe original sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" So \"unless\" here is setting a condition. So it's like saying: Unless every donkey will attack, not all donkeys will attack. Which translates to: If not every donkey will attack, then not all donkeys will attack. Wait, but that's a tautology. Because if not every donkey attacks, then it's already true that not all attack. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure.\n\nWait, maybe the sentence is structured as \"Not (all donkeys will attack) unless (every donkey will attack).\" So \"unless\" is connecting two propositions. Let's recall that \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\". But here, the first part is \"Not all donkeys will attack\", so maybe the entire statement is \"Not all donkeys will attack\" \u2228 \"every donkey will attack\". But that would be \u00ac(\u2200Mx Gx) \u2228 \u2200Mx Gx. Wait, but that's a tautology because if \u2200Mx Gx is true, then the disjunction is true; if it's false, then \u00ac(\u2200Mx Gx) is true, so the disjunction is true. So that can't be the correct translation because the original sentence seems to be making a non-trivial claim. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the original sentence. Let me parse it again. The sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" The \"unless\" here is acting as a conditional. So \"Unless every donkey will attack, not all donkeys will attack.\" Which is equivalent to \"If not every donkey will attack, then not all donkeys will attack.\" But this seems like a tautology again. Because if not every donkey attacks, then it's already true that not all attack. Therefore, the implication holds. But that would mean the original statement is always true, which might be the case. But maybe the intended meaning is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the original sentence is trying to express that the only scenario where not all donkeys attack is when every donkey does attack. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the sentence is saying that if it's not the case that every donkey attacks, then not all donkeys will attack. Which again is a tautology. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is trying to express that \"Not all donkeys will attack\" is only true if \"every donkey will attack\" is true. Which is impossible because if every donkey attacks, then \"not all attack\" is false. So this seems contradictory. Perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nLet me think about the structure again. The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" Let's break it down. The phrase \"unless\" can be thought of as \"if not\". So \"A unless B\" is \"if not B, then A\". So applying that here: \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack\" becomes \"If not (every donkey will attack), then not all donkeys will attack.\" Which is the same as \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)) \u2192 \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx))? Wait, no. Wait, \"every donkey will attack\" is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \"Not all donkeys will attack\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). So the implication would be \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Which is just an implication of the form P \u2192 P, which is always true. Therefore, the entire statement is a tautology. But that seems odd. \n\nBut maybe the original sentence is trying to express something else. Let me consider that maybe \"not all donkeys will attack\" is being contrasted with \"every donkey will attack\". The sentence is saying that the only way for not all donkeys to attack is if every donkey does attack. Which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct translation is that the statement is equivalent to saying that \"every donkey will attack\" must be true. Because if the implication is \u00acB \u2192 A, and A is \"not all...\", and B is \"every...\", then if B is true, the implication holds regardless. But if B is false, then A must be true. But if B is false, then A is also true. Therefore, the implication is always true. Therefore, the entire statement is a tautology. \n\nBut the user is asking to translate the sentence into formal logic. So perhaps the correct translation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx), which is a tautology. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the original sentence. Maybe the original sentence is trying to express that \"Not all donkeys will attack\" is only true if \"every donkey will attack\" is true, which is impossible. Therefore, the only way the implication holds is if \"every donkey will attack\" is true. Therefore, the entire statement is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Because if the implication \u00acB \u2192 A is equivalent to B \u2228 A, and here A is \u00acB, then B \u2228 \u00acB is a tautology. Wait, no. Let me re-express: The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" Which is equivalent to \"Either every donkey will attack or not all donkeys will attack.\" Which is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx), which is always true. Therefore, the correct formalization is a tautology, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the sentence to mean something else. Let me check the original sentence again. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, the sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" So, maybe it's trying to say that unless every donkey attacks, it's not the case that all donkeys attack. Which is again a tautology. \n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to formalize it as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). That is, if not all donkeys attack, then every donkey attacks. Which is a contradiction unless the antecedent is false. Therefore, this would imply that \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) must be true. Because if the implication is \u00acA \u2192 A, then the only way for the implication to hold is if A is true. Because if A is true, then \u00acA \u2192 A is true. If A is false, then \u00acA is true, and the implication becomes false \u2192 false? Wait, no. If A is false, then \u00acA is true, and the implication is true \u2192 false, which is false. Therefore, the entire implication \u00acA \u2192 A is equivalent to A. Therefore, the original sentence is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nSo the formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx), which is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Therefore, the correct translation is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nWait, but how to get there from the original sentence? Let me think again. The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" If we interpret \"unless\" as \"if not\", then it's saying: If it is not the case that every donkey will attack, then not all donkeys will attack. But that's \u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x..., which is a tautology. But if we interpret it as \"Not all donkeys will attack if and only if it is not the case that every donkey will attack\", which would be \u00ac\u2200x... \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x..., which is also a tautology. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct way is to recognize that \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack\" is equivalent to saying that \"If not every donkey attacks, then not all donkeys attack\", which is trivial. But perhaps the user intended it to mean that \"Not all donkeys will attack only if every donkey will attack\", which would be a different structure. \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So \"Not all donkeys will attack only if every donkey will attack\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Which, as discussed, is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nGiven that the original sentence is a bit ambiguous, but the most plausible formalization that isn't a tautology would be that the sentence is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Therefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nBut how to derive that from the original sentence? Let's try again. \n\nThe original sentence: Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack. \n\nLet me rephrase it as: The statement \"Not all donkeys will attack\" is true only if \"every donkey will attack\" is true. So, if \"Not all...\" is true, then \"every...\" must be true. So, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Which, as discussed, implies that \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) must be true. \n\nTherefore, the formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nBut the user wants a single well-formed formula. So the answer would be that implication. Alternatively, since that implication is logically equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx), maybe the user expects that. \n\nBut how to know? Let me check with an example. Suppose there are donkeys. If \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) is true, then the implication holds. If it's false, then the antecedent \u00ac\u2200x... is true, and the consequent is false, making the implication false. Therefore, the entire implication is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Therefore, the two are logically equivalent. \n\nBut the original sentence is phrased in a way that might be more naturally translated as the implication. However, since they are equivalent, perhaps the user expects the simpler form. \n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations are M: [1] is a donkey, G: [1] will attack. So \"every donkey will attack\" is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \"Not all donkeys will attack\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nSo the original sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" Which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nAlternatively, since this is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx), maybe the user expects that. But the problem says to translate the given sentence, not to simplify it. \n\nBut perhaps the example given in the problem can give a clue. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they use the quantifier with the implication. \n\nTherefore, following that example, the correct formalization for \"every donkey will attack\" is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). The \"not all\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nSo the sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\" Which is equivalent to \"If not every donkey will attack, then not all donkeys will attack.\" So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)? No, wait. Wait, \"Not all donkeys will attack\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). The \"unless\" clause is \"every donkey will attack\", which is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nSo the structure is: \u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 \u2200x...? No, the structure is \"A unless B\" where A is \"Not all...\", B is \"every...\". As discussed earlier, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. Wait, no, \"A unless B\" is usually translated as B \u2228 A, or equivalently \u00acB \u2192 A. \n\nSo if A is \"Not all donkeys will attack\" (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)), and B is \"every donkey will attack\" (\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)), then \"A unless B\" is B \u2228 A, which is \u2200x... \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x... which is a tautology. But that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, if \"A unless B\" is \u00acB \u2192 A, then substituting, we get \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx), which is again a tautology. \n\nThis suggests that the original sentence is a tautology, but that seems odd. Maybe there's a different interpretation. Perhaps the sentence is intended to mean that \"Not all donkeys will attack\" is only possible if \"every donkey will attack\" is true. Which would be A \u2192 B, where A is \"Not all...\" and B is \"every...\". So \u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 \u2200x..., which is the same as before. \n\nIn that case, the formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). \n\nTherefore, the answer is that implication. Even though it's equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx), the problem asks to translate the given sentence, not to simplify it. \n\nSo the final answer is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx).\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The sentence is: \"If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the structure. The main conditional is \"If Alfred won't attack, then [something].\" The \"something\" is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" The \"only if\" part might be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. But here, it's part of a larger structure.\n\nSo, the entire sentence can be seen as: If \u00acG(a), then [ (\u00ac\u2200M(x) Q(x,c)) only if \u2200O(y) P(y,c) ].\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. The antecedent is \"Alfred won't attack\" which is \u00acG(a).\n2. The consequent is a bit more complex: \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\"\n\nLet's handle the \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" part. In predicate logic, \"not all\" translates to \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,c)). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,c)). But the original statement is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel,\" which is the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nNow, the \"only if\" part. The structure here is \"A only if B,\" where A is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" and B is \"every monkey saw Hazel.\" So, in logical terms, A \u2192 B. Therefore, the consequent of the main conditional becomes (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,c))) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 P(y,c)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,c))) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 P(y,c)) ]\n\nBut wait, let me check if I got the \"only if\" right. The phrase \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel\" is equivalent to saying that if not all donkeys kicked Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel. So yes, that would be A \u2192 B, where A is the antecedent (the \"not all...\") and B is the consequent (every monkey...). \n\nAnother thing to verify is the use of variables. The first part uses x for donkeys, and the second uses y for monkeys. Since they are separate quantifiers, using different variables is correct to avoid confusion. Also, Hazel is represented by c in both cases, which is correct since it's the same individual.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,c)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 P(y,c)))\n\nNow, let me check if I can simplify or rephrase this. The implication is nested, so maybe I can write it as a chain. Since in logic, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to return a single well-formed formula, and either form is acceptable. However, the original structure is an implication with another implication as the consequent, so I think the way I have it is correct.\n\nAlso, the abbreviations are correctly used: G for attack, a for Alfred, M for donkey, Q for kicked, c for Hazel, O for monkey, P for saw. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. Let me write the final answer accordingly.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Py c))",

The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. The antecedent is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" and the consequent is \"not all donkeys will run only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa).

The original uses \"not all,\" which is a negation of a universal, so \u00ac\u2200x(...) is correct. But maybe the problem expects it in a particular form. However, for the sake of accuracy, I'll stick with \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) as the antecedent.\n\nNow the consequent: \"not all donkeys will run only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" Let's parse this. The phrase \"only if\" in logic usually translates to a conditional where the \"only if\" part is the consequent. So \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. But here, the structure is \"not all donkeys will run only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" So the main clause is \"not all donkeys will run,\" which is similar to the antecedent. Let's first represent \"not all donkeys will run.\" Again, \"all donkeys will run\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx), so negating that gives \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx), or equivalently \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). \n\nNow the \"only if Hazel kicked Alfred\" part. So the entire \"not all donkeys will run\" is the antecedent of an implication where the consequent is \"Hazel kicked Alfred.\" Wait, no. Wait, \"only if\" reverses the direction. Let me think again. If we have \"A only if B,\" that's A \u2192 B. So in this case, the statement is \"Not all donkeys will run only if Qca (Hazel kicked Alfred).\" Therefore, the structure is (Not all donkeys will run) \u2192 Qca. \n\nPutting it all together, the consequent is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Qca. \n\nSo the entire conditional is: If \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa), then (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Qca). \n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then [not all donkeys will run only if Hazel kicked Alfred].\" So the consequent is the \"only if\" statement. Therefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Qca]\n\nAlternatively, we can write this using the existential quantifiers. Let me check if that's necessary. The problem allows using the standard logical symbols, so both universal and existential are okay. However, the way \"only if\" is handled here is as a material implication. \n\nBut let me verify if I have the structure right. The consequent is a conditional where the antecedent is \"not all donkeys will run\" and the consequent is \"Hazel kicked Alfred.\" So the consequent is (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx)) \u2192 Qca. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Qca)\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can use the equivalence A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem just wants the direct translation. So the formula as it is is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can rephrase the consequent. Let me check. The original sentence says \"not all donkeys will run only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" So \"only if\" here is binding the entire \"not all donkeys will run\" to the condition that Hazel kicked Alfred. So that's equivalent to saying that if not all donkeys will run, then Hazel must have kicked Alfred. Which is exactly what we have: \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 Qca. \n\nTherefore, the translation seems correct. Now, let's check if there are any alternative ways. For example, the antecedent could be written as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa), and the consequent's antecedent as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). But the problem allows using any equivalent form as long as it's well-formed. However, the example given uses the universal quantifier with implication, so perhaps the expected answer uses that form. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Qca)\n\nBut let me check the parentheses. The consequent is a conditional, so the parentheses are necessary to group it. Also, the main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. \n\nYes, this seems correct. So the answer should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxa) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Qca)\n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the abbreviations correctly. The abbreviations are:\n\nM: [1] is a donkey\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\n\na: Alfred\n\nF: [1] will run\n\nc: Hazel\n\nSo Qca is \"Hazel (c) kicked Alfred (a)\", which is correct. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxa)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)\u2192Qca)",

The sentence to formalize is: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis is happy.\" The abbreviations provided are M for being a donkey, Q for kicking, c for Hazel, K for being happy, and b for Lewis.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its two parts connected by \"but\". The first part is \"No donkeys kicked Hazel,\" and the second part is \"it is not the case that Lewis is happy.\" Since \"but\" is logically equivalent to \"and\" in this context, the overall structure will be a conjunction of the two parts.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\" In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" can be translated as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx). Here, A is \"donkey\" (Mx) and B is \"kicked Hazel\" (Qx c, since c is Hazel). So, the first part becomes \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acQx c). Alternatively, using the negation of an existential quantifier, \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" can also be expressed as \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Qx c). Both are logically equivalent, but the universal quantifier version might be more straightforward here.\n\nNow the second part: \"It is not the case that Lewis is happy.\" Since Lewis is represented by b, and K is \"is happy,\" this translates to \u00acKb.

So the final formula should be (\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acQx c)) \u2227 \u00acKb.\n\nLet me double-check. The first part correctly states that for all x, if x is a donkey, then x did not kick Hazel. The second part correctly negates that Lewis is happy. The \"but\" is just a conjunction here. I don't see any other elements to consider. The abbreviations are used correctly: M for donkey, Q with the second argument as c (Hazel), and K with b (Lewis). Quantifiers are properly applied.

The sentence to formalize is: \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is happy.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"is a monkey,\" Q for \"[1] kicked [2],\" b for Lewis, and K for \"[1] is happy.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"Not all\" translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. Normally, \"All A are B\" is \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). So \"Not all A are B\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Ax \u2227 \u00acBx), which means \"There exists an A that is not B.\" \n\nIn this case, the A is \"monkeys\" (Ox) and the B is \"kicked Lewis\" (Qxb, since Lewis is denoted by b). So the first part should be either \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) or \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). Both are logically equivalent due to quantifier negation. I need to choose the correct form based on the original sentence's structure. The original uses \"Not all,\" so using the negation of the universal might be more direct here. But either form is acceptable unless specified otherwise. The example given in the problem uses the universal form, so maybe following that style is better here.\n\nSo for the first part: \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nThe second part of the sentence is \"it is not the case that Lewis is happy.\" Since Lewis is represented by b, and K is \"[1] is happy,\" this translates to \u00acKb. \n\nNow, the entire sentence connects these two parts with \"but,\" which in logic is equivalent to a conjunction (\u00ac... \u2227 \u00ac...). So the entire formula should be the conjunction of the first part and the second part. \n\nPutting it all together: \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u00acKb.\n\nWait, let me double-check.

Both forms are correct, but the problem's example uses the universal with negation, so maybe I should stick with that for consistency. \n\nTherefore, the final formula should be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u00acKb.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb) \u2227 \u00acKb",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"Every monkey ate but it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The first part is \"Every monkey ate.\" The abbreviations provided are O for [1] is a monkey and I for [1] ate. So, for the first part, I think this would be similar to the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" became \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So applying that structure here, \"Every monkey ate\" should be \u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix). That makes sense because for all x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x ate (Ix).\n\nNow the second part is \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred.\" The abbreviations here are P for [1] saw [2], c for Hazel, and a for Alfred. So Hazel saw Alfred would be Pc a, right? Because P is a two-place predicate where the first argument is the subject and the second is the object. So Hazel (c) saw Alfred (a) is Pca. But the sentence says it's not the case, so we need to negate that. So \u00acPca.\n\nThe original sentence combines these two parts with \"but,\" which in logic is just a conjunction. Even though \"but\" implies some contrast, in formal logic it's treated the same as \"and.\" So the entire formula should be the conjunction of the two parts: \u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2227 \u00acPca.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The quantifier applies to all monkeys, and each monkey ate. Then the second part is a simple negation of Hazel seeing Alfred. Yes, that seems right. I don't think there are any quantifiers involved in the second part because Hazel and Alfred are specific individuals. So putting it all together, the formalization should be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2227 \u00acPca.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the correct symbols and structure. The universal quantifier for all x, the implication from Ox to Ix, then the conjunction with the negation of Pca. Yes, that looks correct. No need for parentheses around the negation since \u2227 has lower precedence than the quantifier and implication. Wait, actually, the entire universal quantifier statement is one part, and the negation is the other. So the \u2227 is connecting two separate formulas: the universal statement and the negated atomic formula. So the parentheses around Ox\u2192Ix are necessary because the quantifier only applies to Ox\u2192Ix. So the structure is correct. \n\nI think that's it.

The sentence is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank.\" The \"unless\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A unless B\" is usually translated as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\" or \"A \u2228 B\". Wait, but sometimes it can be tricky. Let me think. If the original is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank,\" that can be rephrased as \"If it's not the case that only donkeys drank, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\" Or maybe \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis if only donkeys drank.\" Hmm, no, \"unless\" is like a conditional. So \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"if not B, then A\". So here, \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank\" would mean that if it's not the case that only donkeys drank, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis. Wait, no, maybe the other way around. Let me check again. The structure is \"not P unless Q\" where P is \"Alfred sees Lewis\" and Q is \"only donkeys drank.\" So \"not P unless Q\" translates to \"Q \u2228 \u00acP\", which is equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". Alternatively, \"If not Q, then not P.\" So the original statement is saying that Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless (only donkeys drank). So the condition for Alfred not seeing Lewis is that only donkeys drank. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis if it's not the case that only donkeys drank.\" Which would be \"If not Q, then not P.\" So the implication is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. \n\nNow, what is Q? Q is \"only donkeys drank.\" How to express \"only donkeys drank\"? That would mean that everything that drank is a donkey. So for all x, if Hx (x drank), then Mx (x is a donkey). So Q is \u2200x(Hx \u2192 Mx). \n\nSo putting it together: The original statement is equivalent to \"If it's not the case that only donkeys drank, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\" So \u00ac(\u2200x(Hx \u2192 Mx)) \u2192 \u00acP(a, b). But in logic, the negation of \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx) is \u2203x (Hx \u2227 \u00acMx). So maybe we can write it as \u2203x (Hx \u2227 \u00acMx) \u2192 \u00acP(a, b). \n\nAlternatively, since the original is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank,\" which is equivalent to \"If Alfred sees Lewis, then only donkeys drank.\" Which would be P(a,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). That seems another way to phrase it. Let me check: \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" or \"A \u2228 B\". Wait, maybe I should recall that \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\". So in this case, \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is \u00acP(a,b). So the statement is \u00acP(a,b) \u2228 B, where B is \"only donkeys drank\". Which is \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). So the entire formula would be \u00acP(a,b) \u2228 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). Which can be written as \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx) \u2228 \u00acP(a,b). However, in predicate logic, the order doesn't matter for the disjunction. But maybe it's better to express it as an implication. Since A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. So if we take A as \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx) and B as \u00acP(a,b), then it's not exactly matching. Wait, original is \u00acP(a,b) \u2228 B, where B is \"only donkeys drank\", which is \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). So \u00acP(a,b) \u2228 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx) is equivalent to P(a,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). So that would be the implication form. \n\nSo which is the correct way to formalize? The original sentence says that Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank. So if Alfred does see Lewis, then it must be that only donkeys drank. So P(a,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). That seems correct. Alternatively, if it's not the case that only donkeys drank (i.e., there exists someone who drank and isn't a donkey), then Alfred doesn't see Lewis. Which would be \u2203x (Hx \u2227 \u00acMx) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). Both are logically equivalent, since the contrapositive of P\u2192Q is \u00acQ\u2192\u00acP. \n\nNow, which form is preferable? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Let me check the abbreviations. The abbreviations are P: [1] saw [2], a: Alfred, b: Lewis, M: [1] is a donkey, H: [1] drank. \n\nSo the formula would need to use these. Let me think. The \"only donkeys drank\" is \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). So if I go with the implication P(a,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx), that would be correct. Alternatively, the other way. But perhaps the first way is more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original sentence can be read as \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless (only donkeys drank)\", which is equivalent to \"Only if only donkeys drank, does Alfred see Lewis.\" Which is P(a,b) only if \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx), which translates to P(a,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the formalization is P(a,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). \n\nBut let me check again. The original is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank.\" So \"unless\" introduces the condition. So \"unless B\" is like \"if not B then not A\", where A is \"Alfred sees Lewis\". Wait, if the structure is \"A unless B\", then it's \"if not B, then A\". But here, the sentence is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless B\". So \"\u00acA unless B\", which would be \"if not B, then \u00acA\". So \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. Which is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So in this case, B is \"only donkeys drank\", which is \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). So \u00acB \u2192 \u00acP(a,b) is equivalent to P(a,b) \u2192 B. \n\nSo both forms are acceptable. The question is which one to choose. Since the problem asks for a well-formed formula, either is correct, but perhaps one is more straightforward. \n\nIn predicate logic, implications are often preferred when possible. So writing P(a,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx) is a valid formula. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx) \u2190 Pab, but in symbols, it's Pab \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). \n\nWait, the direction of the implication. Since \"if Alfred sees Lewis, then only donkeys drank,\" the implication is Pab \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the final formula is Pab \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). \n\nBut let me check again. Suppose Alfred does see Lewis. Then according to the formula, only donkeys drank. Which matches the original statement. If Alfred sees Lewis, then it must be that only donkeys drank. If there's someone who drank and isn't a donkey, then Alfred can't see Lewis. So the formula seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Pab \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank.\" So another way to think: the only way Alfred can see Lewis is if only donkeys drank. So yes, that's exactly what the implication says. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the formalization is P(a,b) \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx). \n\nNow, using the abbreviations: P is [1] saw [2], so Pab is \"Alfred saw Lewis\". The sentence says \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\", so the antecedent is Pab leading to the consequent. \n\nYes. So the final formula is Pab \u2192 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx).\n</think>\n\nPab\u2192\u2200x(Hx\u2192Mx)",

The sentence is: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred will run only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then (B only if C). \n\nSo, A is \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, O is [1] is a monkey, and P is [1] saw [2]. Since Lewis is 'b', A would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb). That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the then part is \"Alfred will run only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"B only if C\" translates to B \u2192 C. So, if Alfred runs (F a), then every monkey kicked Lewis. \n\nSo B is F a. C is \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\" For C, using Q (kicked), it would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is: If A, then (B \u2192 C). So the formula would be [A \u2192 (B \u2192 C)].\n\nNow substituting the parts:\n\nA is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)\nB is F a\nC is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)\n\nSo the whole formula is:\n\n(\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)) \u2192 (F a \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb))\n\nI need to check if I used all the abbreviations correctly. The abbreviations given are O, P, b, F, a, Q. Yes, I used them as specified. Also, the structure uses the standard logical symbols with quantifiers and connectives. The only connective here is \u2192, but I might need to check if there's a need for other connectives. Wait, the original sentence is a conditional leading to another conditional. So the structure is correct. \n\nI think that's it. Let me make sure there are no quantifier issues. The variables are all bound correctly. The first part is a universal quantifier over x for monkeys seeing Lewis. The conclusion part has F a leading to another universal quantifier over x for monkeys kicking Lewis. Yes, that seems right. \n\nNo need for parentheses beyond what's necessary for well-formedness. The main connective is the outer \u2192, then inside the consequent is another \u2192.

The abbreviations are N for being a human, M for being a donkey, and R for chased. \n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. There's a human who chased a donkey. But the donkey that was chased also chased \"it.\" The \"it\" here probably refers back to the human, right? So the donkey chased the human. Wait, but the original sentence says \"a donkey that chased it.\" So the structure is: there exists a human, and there exists a donkey, such that the human chased the donkey, and the donkey chased the human (since \"it\" refers to the human). \n\nBut how to represent this with quantifiers? The sentence starts with \"A human chased a donkey...\" which suggests there exists at least one human and one donkey with that relationship. Then the donkey \"chased it,\" meaning the donkey chased the human. \n\nSo breaking it down: \u2203x\u2203y (N(x) \u2227 M(y) \u2227 R(x,y) \u2227 R(y,x)). Wait, because the human x chased the donkey y (R(x,y)), and the donkey y chased the human x (R(y,x)). But wait, the original sentence is \"A human chased a donkey that chased it.\" So the donkey is the one that chased the human. The \"it\" refers to the human. So yes, the donkey chased the human. So the formula would be there exists x and y where x is human, y is donkey, x chased y, and y chased x. \n\nBut let me check if the \"it\" refers to the human. The sentence structure is: a human chased a donkey [that chased it]. The relative clause \"that chased it\" modifies the donkey. So the donkey chased something. What did it chase? The antecedent of \"it\" here is the human. So the donkey chased the human. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u2203x\u2203y (N(x) \u2227 M(y) \u2227 R(x,y) \u2227 R(y,x)). \n\nWait, but maybe there's a different way to structure it. Let me think again. The sentence could be read as: there's a human who chased a donkey, and that donkey chased something. But what did the donkey chase? The \"it\" is the antecedent, which is likely the human. So the donkey chased the human. Therefore, the formula is as I wrote before. \n\nAnother way: The structure is \"A human (x) chased a donkey (y) that (y) chased it (x).\" So yes, the variables x and y are such that N(x), M(y), R(x,y), and R(y,x). Therefore, the translation is \u2203x\u2203y (N(x) \u2227 M(y) \u2227 R(x,y) \u2227 R(y,x)). \n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers are correctly ordered. Since both are existential, the order of \u2203x\u2203y doesn't matter here. So the formula should be correct. Let me check if there's any other possible interpretation. Suppose \"it\" refers to the donkey? That would be odd. The donkey chased itself? Unlikely. So the correct interpretation is that the donkey chased the human. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is \u2203x\u2203y(Nx \u2227 My \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx).\n</think>\n\n\u2203x\u2203y(Nx \u2227 My \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"Every donkey is happy or it is not the case that Lewis will run\" into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is \"Every donkey is happy or [it is not the case that Lewis will run].\" The \"or\" here connects two parts: one about donkeys being happy and another about Lewis not running.\n\nThe abbreviations given are:\n- M: [1] is a donkey\n- K: [1] is happy\n- F: [1] will run\n- b: Lewis\n\nSo, for the first part, \"Every donkey is happy,\" that's a universal quantifier. So \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). That's straightforward.\n\nThe second part is \"it is not the case that Lewis will run.\" Since Lewis is represented by 'b', and F is \"[1] will run,\" then Lewis will run is Fb. So the negation would be \u00acFb.\n\nNow, the original sentence combines these two parts with \"or.\" So the entire statement is saying that for every donkey, either it is happy, or Lewis isn't running. Wait, but how is the \"or\" scoped here? The original sentence is \"Every donkey is happy or it is not the case that Lewis will run.\" The \"or\" is outside the quantifier? Or is it inside?\n\nWait, the structure is \"Every donkey (is happy or [global condition])\". Wait, no. Let me parse the English sentence again. The sentence is \"Every donkey is happy or it is not the case that Lewis will run.\" The \"or\" here is connecting two propositions: \"Every donkey is happy\" and \"Lewis will not run.\" So the entire statement is (Every donkey is happy) \u2228 (\u00acFb). But in predicate logic, how do you handle that? Because \"Every donkey is happy\" is a universal statement, and the \"or\" is at the top level.\n\nWait, but if you have a universal quantifier and then an \"or\" with another proposition, you need to structure it as (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx)) \u2228 \u00acFb. That would be correct. Because the original sentence is asserting that either all donkeys are happy, or Lewis isn't running. So the \"or\" is between two separate propositions.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible interpretation. Could the sentence be read as \"For every donkey, either it is happy or Lewis isn't running\"? That would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb)). But in that case, the \"or\" is inside the scope of the quantifier. Which interpretation is correct?\n\nThe original sentence is ambiguous in English, but the way it's phrased: \"Every donkey is happy or it is not the case that Lewis will run.\" The \"it\" here refers to the entire previous clause? Or does the \"or\" apply per donkey? \n\nIn English, sometimes the scope can be ambiguous. However, the way it's written here, \"Every donkey is happy or [something].\" Typically, in such sentences, the \"or\" can be read as applying to the entire universal statement versus the other disjunct. But sometimes it's read as a per-instance disjunction. \n\nBut let's look at the example given in the problem. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So when there's a universal quantifier, the structure is \u2200x (condition \u2192 ...). \n\nIn this case, if the original sentence was \"Every donkey is happy or sad,\" that would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 ...)). But here, the second disjunct is about Lewis. So perhaps the correct reading is that for each donkey, either it is happy or Lewis isn't running. Because the \"or\" is part of the predicate for each donkey. Wait, but the original sentence is structured as \"Every donkey is happy OR [something else].\" The \"or\" might be at the level of the entire statement. For example, either all donkeys are happy, or Lewis isn't running. \n\nBut how do we know? Let me think of an example. Suppose there are two donkeys. If the first reading is correct (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u00acFb), then the statement is true if either all donkeys are happy, or Lewis isn't running. If the second reading is correct (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb))), then for each donkey, either it is happy or Lewis isn't running. In this case, if Lewis is running (Fb is true), then each donkey must be happy. If Lewis isn't running, then the donkey can be happy or not. \n\nThe original sentence is ambiguous, but in formal logic, we need to pick one. How is it usually translated? Typically, when you have a sentence like \"Every A is B or C,\" it's often interpreted as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 (B(x) \u2228 C)). But here, the C is not about x, it's about Lewis. So perhaps the correct formalization is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb)). \n\nBut the original sentence is phrased as \"Every donkey is happy or it is not the case that Lewis will run.\" The \"it\" here refers to the entire previous clause? Or is it part of the same clause? \n\nAnother way to think: if you rephrase the sentence as \"Either every donkey is happy, or Lewis will not run,\" then it's (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx)) \u2228 \u00acFb. But if it's \"For every donkey, either it is happy or Lewis will not run,\" then it's \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb)). \n\nWhich is the correct interpretation? In English, the placement of \"or\" can change the scope. Let's consider that the original sentence is \"Every donkey is happy or it is not the case that Lewis will run.\" The \"it\" here is a bit ambiguous. However, in such sentences, if the second part of the \"or\" is a separate proposition not involving the quantified variable, it's often the case that the \"or\" is at the level of the entire universal statement. However, sometimes it's read as a per-instance disjunction. \n\nBut given that the example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier with an implication, perhaps the intended answer here is that the \"or\" is part of the implication. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose we have \"Every student passed or the exam was easy.\" How would we translate that? It could be either \u2200x (Student(x) \u2192 Passed(x)) \u2228 EasyExam, or \u2200x (Student(x) \u2192 (Passed(x) \u2228 EasyExam)). The first interpretation is that either all students passed or the exam was easy. The second is that for each student, either they passed or the exam was easy. Which is correct? It depends on context, but in formal logic, without more context, it's ambiguous. However, in some logical frameworks, the default might be to assume the second interpretation, where the disjunction is inside the scope of the quantifier. \n\nBut how would the original sentence be phrased if it meant the first interpretation? Maybe \"Either every donkey is happy, or Lewis will not run.\" Whereas the given sentence is phrased as \"Every donkey is happy or it is not the case that Lewis will run.\" The \"or\" here is after the universal subject. This structure might suggest that the \"or\" is part of the predicate for each donkey. For example, \"Every donkey is [happy or (Lewis won't run)]\". But since \"Lewis won't run\" isn't about the donkey, it's a bit odd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is intended to have the \"or\" outside. For example, if there's a donkey that isn't happy, then Lewis must not run. But how would that be phrased? \n\nGiven that the problem is asking for a formalization and the example uses a universal quantifier with an implication, perhaps the intended answer is that the \"or\" is inside the scope of the quantifier. Let me test both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb)). This would mean that for every donkey x, either x is happy or Lewis isn't running. \n\nSecond possibility: (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx)) \u2228 \u00acFb. This would mean that either all donkeys are happy or Lewis isn't running. \n\nWhich one is correct? Let me check with some examples. Suppose there are two donkeys: Donkey A and Donkey B. \n\nCase 1: Lewis is running (Fb is true). \n\nIn the first interpretation (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb))), since Fb is true, \u00acFb is false. Therefore, for each donkey to satisfy the implication, Kx must be true. Therefore, all donkeys must be happy. \n\nIn the second interpretation, (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx)) \u2228 \u00acFb, since \u00acFb is false, the entire statement is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). So again, all donkeys must be happy. \n\nIn this case, both interpretations give the same result when Fb is true. \n\nCase 2: Lewis is not running (\u00acFb is true). \n\nIn the first interpretation, since \u00acFb is true, for every donkey, the disjunction Kx \u2228 \u00acFb is true regardless of Kx. Therefore, the entire statement is true regardless of the donkeys' happiness. \n\nIn the second interpretation, since \u00acFb is true, the entire statement is true regardless of the universal part. \n\nSo in both cases, when Fb is false, both interpretations are true. \n\nBut what if Lewis is running (Fb true), and there's a donkey that is not happy? \n\nIn the first interpretation, the implication Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb) would be Mx \u2192 (False \u2228 False) \u2192 Mx \u2192 False. If there's a donkey (Mx true), then this implication is false. Therefore, the entire universal statement is false. \n\nIn the second interpretation, since \u00acFb is false, the entire statement is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). If there's a donkey that isn't happy, then this universal statement is false. \n\nSo in both cases, the truth value is the same. Wait, so in all cases, both interpretations are logically equivalent? \n\nWait, is \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 (B(x) \u2228 C)) equivalent to (\u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x))) \u2228 C, assuming C is a proposition not involving x? \n\nLet me check with logical equivalences. \n\nLet\u2019s suppose C is a proposition that doesn\u2019t involve x. \n\n\u2200x (A(x) \u2192 (B(x) \u2228 C)) is equivalent to \u2200x ((A(x) \u2227 \u00acB(x)) \u2192 C). But since C doesn't depend on x, if there's any x where A(x) \u2227 \u00acB(x), then C must be true. \n\nOn the other hand, (\u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x))) \u2228 C is equivalent to (\u00ac\u2203x (A(x) \u2227 \u00acB(x))) \u2228 C, which is equivalent to \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)) \u2228 C. \n\nBut are these two equivalent? Let's see. \n\nSuppose C is true. Then both statements are true. \n\nIf C is false, then \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 (B(x) \u2228 C)) becomes \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)), and (\u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x))) \u2228 C becomes the same. So when C is false, they are equivalent. \n\nBut when C is true, both are true. Therefore, the two statements are logically equivalent. \n\nWait, so in this case, the two interpretations are equivalent. Therefore, both formalizations are equivalent. \n\nBut how does that work? Let me take an example. Let\u2019s say A(x) is \"x is a donkey\", B(x) is \"x is happy\", and C is \"\u00acFb\". \n\nThen \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb)) is equivalent to (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx)) \u2228 \u00acFb. \n\nTherefore, both formalizations are equivalent. \n\nSo regardless of how we structure the \"or\", the resulting formulas are equivalent. Therefore, either formalization is acceptable. \n\nBut the problem says to use the given abbreviations and return a single well-formed formula. Given the example provided, where the universal quantifier is used with an implication, perhaps the intended answer is to have the \"or\" inside the implication, as in \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb)). \n\nBut since both are equivalent, maybe the problem expects one of them. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" The formalization was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So in that case, the structure is universal quantifier with implication leading to a relation involving the variable and a constant. \n\nIn the current problem, if we follow the same pattern, the structure would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ...). The ... would be the disjunction of Kx and \u00acFb. Therefore, the formalization would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb)). \n\nAlternatively, if the \"or\" was between two universal statements, but here the second part is not a universal statement. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u00acFb)). \n\nSo the answer should be \u2200x(Mx\u2192(Kx\u2228\u00acFb)).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192(Kx\u2228\u00acFb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is: \"If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure seems to be a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The original sentence is \"If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\" \n\nHmm. The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. So maybe the structure here is that the entire \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is the antecedent of a conditional where the \"only if\" introduces the consequent. Wait, but the sentence starts with \"If Hazel is hungry, then...\" So the whole thing is a conditional where the consequent is a statement involving \"only if\". Let me rephrase the sentence for clarity.\n\nThe sentence can be rephrased as: If Hazel is hungry, then (it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Hazel) only if (every human saw Hazel). So translating \"only if\" here would mean that the part before \"only if\" is the antecedent and the part after is the consequent. So, \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" only if \"every human saw Hazel\" becomes (not all donkeys kicked Hazel) \u2192 (every human saw Hazel). \n\nBut the entire thing is under the condition that Hazel is hungry. So the overall structure is: Lc \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2200 donkeys kicked c) \u2192 (\u2200 humans saw c) ].\n\nNow let's translate each part using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, \"Hazel is hungry\" is Lc, since L is \"[1] is hungry\" and c is Hazel.\n\nNext, \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\". The statement \"all donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx c), since Mx means x is a donkey, and Qx c means x kicked Hazel. The negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx c). Alternatively, by logical equivalences, that's equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx c). But maybe we should keep it as \u00ac\u2200x... unless the problem requires it to be in a certain form. The original sentence says \"not all...\", so it's straightforward to use the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nThen, \"every human saw Hazel\" would be \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Py c), since N is [1] is a human and P is [1] saw [2].\n\nPutting it all together, the consequent of the main conditional (the part after \"then\") is (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc). Therefore, the entire formula is Lc \u2192 [ \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc) ].\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original sentence is \"If Hazel is hungry, then [not all donkeys kicked Hazel] only if [every human saw Hazel]\". So the structure is: If A, then (B only if C). Which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Because \"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. So yes, the consequent is (B \u2192 C), making the whole formula A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). \n\nSo substituting, A is Lc, B is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc), and C is \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc). Therefore, the formula is Lc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc)).\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes people might prefer to rephrase implications for simplicity, but the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax. So I think that's correct. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here.\n\nAnother way to think about \"only if\": The original statement is saying that the truth of \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is conditional on \"every human saw Hazel\". So whenever \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true, it must be that \"every human saw Hazel\" is also true. Hence, the implication \u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 \u2200y... \n\nTherefore, combining with the initial condition about Hazel being hungry, the entire formula is as above. \n\nSo using the abbreviations provided:\n\n- Lc for Hazel is hungry.\n- Mx for x is a donkey.\n- Qx c for x kicked Hazel.\n- Ny for y is a human.\n- Py c for y saw Hazel.\n\nThe final formula is Lc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc)).\n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers and variables are correctly scoped. Also, the variables x and y can be the same or different; since they are bound by different quantifiers, it's okay. The formula should be well-formed. \n\nYes, I think that's the correct translation.\n</think>\n\nLc\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc)\u2192\u2200y(Ny\u2192Pyc))",

The main structure is a conditional: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then Hazel kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" \n\nFirst, I'll handle the antecedent of the main conditional: \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and P is \"[1] saw [2]\". So, \"every monkey saw Lewis\" translates to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb), where b is Lewis. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Hazel kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, the antecedent of this implication is \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" and the consequent is \"no humans are hungry.\"\n\nBreaking that down: \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" uses Q, which is \"[1] kicked [2]\". Since both are Hazel, it's Qcc. Then \"no humans are hungry\" means that for all x, if x is a human (N), then x is not hungry (\u00acLx). So that would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx).\n\nPutting it together, the consequent is Qcc \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). \n\nNow, combining the antecedent and consequent with the main conditional: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (Qcc \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)). \n\nWait, but in predicate logic, the implication is a material conditional, so the entire structure is correct. Let me check if there are any scope issues or if quantifiers need to be moved. The consequent's implication is between Qcc and the universal statement about humans. That seems right. Also, the variables in the second universal quantifier use x again, but since it's a different scope, it's acceptable. Alternatively, using a different variable like y wouldn't matter here, but since the original uses x, I can stick with x as it's within its own scope.\n\nSo the final formula should be: \u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192(Qcc\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx)). \n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations to make sure I didn't mix up any symbols. O is for monkey, P for saw, b is Lewis. Q is kicked, c is Hazel. N is human, L is hungry. Yes, that's all correct. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the \"only if\" part. The original sentence says Hazel kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry. So if Hazel did kick herself, then it must be the case that no humans are hungry. Which is exactly captured by Qcc \u2192 \u2200x... So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192(Qcc\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx))",

The sentence is: \"If Hazel is hungry, then no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The abbreviations given are L for \"[1] is hungry\", c for Hazel, O for \"[1] is a monkey\", Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\", M for \"[1] is a donkey\", and I for \"[1] ate\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main structure seems to be a conditional: \"If Hazel is hungry, then [some statement].\" The \"some statement\" part is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. But here, the whole thing is in the consequent of the main conditional.\n\nLet me break it down. The main conditional is Lc \u2192 [something]. The something is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" Let me rephrase that part. \"No monkeys kicked Hazel\" is equivalent to saying \"For all x, if x is a monkey, then x did not kick Hazel.\" So that would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQx c). \n\nNow, the \"only if\" part connects this to \"no donkeys ate.\" So \"no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate\" translates to: If no monkeys kicked Hazel, then no donkeys ate. Wait, but \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So here, A is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" and B is \"no donkeys ate.\" Therefore, the whole part would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)). Wait, \"no donkeys ate\" is equivalent to \"for all y, if y is a donkey, then y did not eat.\" Which can also be written as \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). Alternatively, \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy). Either form is acceptable, but maybe the negated existential is better here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main formula is Lc \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)) ].\n\nBut let me check if I got the \"only if\" right. The original phrase is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" So \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So the statement is that the truth of \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" requires that \"no donkeys ate.\" Therefore, the correct translation is indeed that if \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is true, then \"no donkeys ate\" must be true. Which is the implication I wrote above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to structure it. Let me think again. The original sentence is structured as \"If A, then (B only if C)\", where A is Hazel is hungry, B is no monkeys kicked Hazel, and C is no donkeys ate. So \"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. Therefore, the entire formula is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Which is equivalent to what I had before.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nA is Lc.\n\nB is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" which is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQx c).\n\nC is \"no donkeys ate\" which is \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy) or equivalently \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). Either way is fine, but perhaps using the universal quantifier is more straightforward here. Let me check the abbreviations again. The abbreviation for I is \"[1] ate\", so for \"no donkeys ate\", we can write \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nLc \u2192 [ ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) ) \u2192 ( \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy) ) ]\n\nBut since variables are just bound variables, we can reuse x or y if needed, but it's better to keep them separate for clarity. Also, in predicate logic, the order of quantifiers matters, but here they are in different scopes.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that I'm using the abbreviations correctly. Let me check each part:\n\n- Lc: Hazel is hungry (since L is [1] is hungry, and c is Hazel).\n\n- Ox: x is a monkey.\n\n- Qxc: x kicked Hazel (since Q is [1] kicked [2], so first argument is x, second is c).\n\n- My: y is a donkey.\n\n- Iy: y ate.\n\nSo yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the entire formula is:\n\nLc \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications are right-associative, so A \u2192 B \u2192 C is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, to make it explicit, parentheses can be added. But the standard syntax would parse it as (Lc \u2192 ( ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) ) \u2192 ( \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy) ) )).\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\nLc \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy) )\n\nAlternatively, since the variables x and y can be the same (as they are bound variables in different scopes), maybe we can use x in both, but it's better to use different variables to avoid confusion. However, in formal logic, it's acceptable to reuse variables in different scopes. But perhaps the problem expects distinct variables. However, since the original uses x and y in the example, maybe it's okay.\n\nBut looking back at the example given: \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). They used x as the variable. So perhaps in this case, for the two universal quantifiers, we can use the same variable, but since they are in different scopes, it's allowed. However, to avoid confusion, using different variables is better. However, since the problem says to return a single well-formed formula, and as long as it's syntactically correct, either way is acceptable. Let me check if there's a standard way. Typically, in such cases, variables are reused if they are in different scopes, but using different variables is also acceptable. For clarity, perhaps using different variables is better. But given that the example uses x, maybe the problem expects variables to be reused if possible. However, since there are two separate universal quantifiers, perhaps using x and y is okay. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\nLc \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy) )\n\nBut since the problem might expect the use of the same variable (as in the example), perhaps using x in both? Wait, no. The first universal quantifier is over monkeys (Ox), and the second is over donkeys (My). So variables x and y are in different scopes. Therefore, using different variables is necessary to avoid confusion. So I think using x and y is correct.\n\nTherefore, the formalization is:\n\nLc \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy) )\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write the consequent as an implication between the two universals, that's correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. The original sentence says \"no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" Another way to think about \"only if\" is that the entire statement is a material implication where the antecedent is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" and the consequent is \"no donkeys ate.\" Therefore, the structure is as above.\n\nSo I think this is the correct formalization. Let me check again for any possible mistakes. The main connective is the implication from Hazel being hungry to the implication between the two universals. Yes. And each part uses the correct predicates. The \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is correctly expressed as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). The \"no donkeys ate\" is \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\nLc \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy) )\n\nBut in the example, they used a single quantifier and implication. Here, we have nested implications. Also, in terms of notation, the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so this should be acceptable.\n</think>\n\nLc\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00acQxc)\u2192\u2200y(My\u2192\u00acIy))",

The sentence is: \"A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Alfred isn't hungry.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"[1] is a monkey\", L for \"[1] is hungry\", and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The first part is \"A monkey is hungry.\" In predicate logic, \"A monkey\" would be an existential quantifier, right? So there exists some x such that O(x) (x is a monkey) and L(x) (x is hungry). So that part would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx).\n\nThen the second part is \"but it is not the case that Alfred isn't hungry.\" The word \"but\" here is just a conjunction, so it's like \"and\" in logic. The phrase \"it is not the case that Alfred isn't hungry\" is a double negative. Let's parse that. \"Alfred isn't hungry\" would be \u00acL(a), since L is \"[1] is hungry\" and a is Alfred. Then \"it is not the case\" that would be another negation, so \u00ac\u00acL(a). But double negation cancels out, so this simplifies to L(a).\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire sentence is saying that there exists a monkey who is hungry, and Alfred is hungry. So the formula should be the conjunction of the two parts: \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 La.\n\nWait, but let me check if I got the abbreviations right. The first part uses O for monkey and L for hungry. The second part refers to Alfred, so using a as the constant. So yes, La would be \"Alfred is hungry\".\n\nSo combining both parts with a conjunction (since \"but\" is just logical and), the final formula should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 La. Let me make sure there are no quantifier issues. The existential quantifier applies only to the first part, and the second part is a separate statement about Alfred. So yes, the conjunction is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: the original sentence says \"A monkey is hungry\" which is an existential statement. If it had said \"All monkeys are hungry,\" it would be a universal. But here it's \"A monkey,\" so \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) is correct. \n\nSo the final answer should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 La.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 La",

The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the original sentence says \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if Alfred will run.\" So, the main conditional is \"If A, then (B only if C).\" \n\nIn logic, \"only if\" is typically represented as an implication where the consequent is the \"only if\" part. So \"B only if C\" translates to B \u2192 C. So the entire structure would be A \u2192 (B \u2192 C).\n\nNow, let's parse each part. \n\nA is \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, O is [1] is a monkey, and P is [1] saw [2]. So \"every monkey saw Lewis\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb), since b is Lewis. \n\nB is \"a human chased Hazel.\" Here, N is [1] is a human, R is [1] chased [2], and c is Hazel.

So this part translates to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb). Wait, no\u2014actually, \"a human\" here might be existential. So there exists some human who chased Lewis. So that would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb).\n\nThen the consequence is \"then Alfred saw Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The \"only if\" here is important. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So the structure here is: If [human chased Lewis], then [Alfred saw Alfred \u2192 every monkey kicked Lewis]. \n\nSo the main implication is (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 (Paa \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Qyb)).

Because R is [1] chased [2], so both arguments are c.\n\nNow B: \"every human saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" This part is a bit trickier. Let's parse it.

But here, it's \"every human saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" So for every human, if they saw Hazel, then it must be that no donkeys ate.\n\nSo first, \"every human saw Hazel only if...\" translates to \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 (P(x, c) \u2192 ...)). The ... is \"no donkeys ate.\" \"No donkeys ate\" would be \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)). Because there does not exist a y that is a donkey and ate.\n\nPutting that together, the entire B part is \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 (P(x, c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)) )).\n\nSo the entire formula would be: \u00acR(c, c) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 (P(x, c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)) )).\n\nWait, but maybe I can simplify the negation. \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)) is equivalent to \u2200y (M(y) \u2192 \u00acI(y)). But the problem says to use the given abbreviations, so I should stick with the existential quantifier negated. Let me check if that's allowed. The user didn't mention anything about simplifying, just to use the abbreviations. So I think using \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)) is acceptable.\n\nSo combining all parts, the formula is:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy)))\n\nI need to make sure the variables are properly quantified. The x is bound by \u2200x, and y by \u2203y. Also, since the abbreviations don't have arguments in the predicates, we need to apply them with variables. For example, Nx is \"[x] is a human\".\n\nAnother thing to check: the original sentence says \"every human saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The \"only if\" makes the implication direction correct as P \u2192 Q. So if a human saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. So the structure is correct.\n\nI think that's it. Let me write that in the formal syntax.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy)))",

The sentence is \"A human is happy and a monkey is happy.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. It has two parts connected by \"and\": \"A human is happy\" and \"a monkey is happy.\" \n\nLooking at the abbreviations:\n- N: [1] is a human\n- K: [1] is happy\n- O: [1] is a monkey\n\nSo for the first part, \"A human is happy,\" I think this means there exists at least one human who is happy. In predicate logic, that would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Kx). Wait, but maybe it's not about existence? Wait, the original sentence says \"A human is happy\"\u2014so it's like there exists a human who is happy. Similarly for the monkey part.\n\nSo the second part, \"a monkey is happy,\" would be \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Ky). Then combine them with \u2227 because of the \"and.\"\n\nBut wait, do I need to use different variables for each? Like x and y? Or can I use the same variable? Well, since they are separate statements, using different variables is better to avoid confusion. So the entire formula would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Kx) \u2227 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Ky).\n\nLet me check if there's another way. Maybe the sentence is asserting that there's a human and a monkey, each of whom is happy. So two separate existential quantifiers. Yes, that's correct. So combining the two existential statements with a conjunction.\n\nAlternatively, could it be interpreted as a single entity being both a human and a monkey? But no, the original sentence says \"a human is happy and a monkey is happy,\" which implies two different entities. So separate existentials.\n\nSo the final formula should be the conjunction of two existential statements. Each with their own variable. So using \u2203x and \u2203y. \n\nLet me make sure the abbreviations are used correctly. N for human, O for monkey, K for happy. So for the human part, Nx (x is a human) and Kx (x is happy). Similarly for the monkey: Oy and Ky. \n\nYes, that seems right. So putting it all together: \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Kx) \u2227 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ky). \n\nI think that's the correct formalization.

So the sentence is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Lewis won't run only if every human saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are N for being a human, R for chased, b is Lewis, F for will run, P for saw, and c is Hazel. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If a human chased Lewis, then...\" So the antecedent is \"a human chased Lewis,\" which would be an existential statement, right? Like there exists some x such that N(x) and R(x, b). Wait, but in formal logic, sometimes \"a human\" could be interpreted as an existential quantifier. So maybe \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb). \n\nThen the consequent is \"Lewis won't run only if every human saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the \"Lewis won't run\" is the A part, and \"every human saw Hazel\" is the B part. So the consequent would be \u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Py c). Wait, because \"Lewis won't run\" is \u00acFb. And \"every human saw Hazel\" is \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Py c). \n\nPutting it all together, the whole sentence is: If [there exists a human who chased Lewis], then [\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Py c)]. So the entire formula would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Py c)). \n\nBut wait, sometimes in logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if I need to adjust the quantifiers. The antecedent is an existential, and the consequent is a conditional. The consequent's antecedent is \u00acFb, and its consequent is a universal. So the structure is correct. \n\nAnother thing to consider: Are there any scope issues? The existential quantifier in the antecedent applies only to x. The universal in the consequent applies to y. Since variables are bound within their scope, this should be okay. \n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations. N is [1] is a human, so Nx. R is [1] chased [2], so Rxb means x chased b (Lewis). F is [1] will run, so Fb is Lewis will run. The negation is \u00acFb. P is [1] saw [2], so Py c is y saw Hazel (c). \n\nYes, that all seems right. So the final formula should be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc)). \n\nWait, I should make sure that the \"only if\" is correctly placed. The original sentence says \"Lewis won't run only if every human saw Hazel.\" So \"Lewis won't run\" is the sufficient condition here? Wait no, \"only if\" sets a necessary condition. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if Lewis doesn't run, then it must be that every human saw Hazel. So the consequent is \u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the whole implication is that if there's a human who chased Lewis, then this conditional holds. \n\nI think that's the right translation. Let me write it out again with the proper symbols. Using \u2200 and \u2203 as needed. So:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyc))\n\nYes, that looks like a well-formed formula. Let me check if all the variables are properly bound. The x in the antecedent is bound by \u2203x. The y in the consequent is bound by \u2200y. The b and c are constants. No free variables here. \n\nI think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192(\u00acFb\u2192\u2200y(Ny\u2192Pyc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is \"There is not a monkey that every human kicked.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"is a monkey,\" N for \"is a human,\" and Q for \"kicked.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the sentence. It's a negative existential statement. It's saying that there doesn't exist a monkey such that all humans have kicked it. In other words, for every monkey, it's not the case that every human kicked it.\n\nLet me break it down. The original sentence can be rephrased as \"It is not the case that there exists a monkey which is kicked by every human.\" In predicate logic, existential quantifiers (\u2203) are used for \"there exists,\" and universal quantifiers (\u2200) for \"every.\"\n\nSo starting with the negation: \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 ...). The \"...\" part should represent \"every human kicked x.\" How to express \"every human kicked x\"? For all y, if Ny (y is a human), then Qy (y kicked x). So \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx).\n\nPutting it together: The entire formula would be \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx)). But wait, let me check if that's correct. The original sentence is saying there's no monkey that every human kicked. So, for every monkey, there's at least one human who didn't kick it. Alternatively, the negation of \"there exists a monkey such that all humans kicked it\" is \"for all monkeys, there exists a human who didn't kick them.\"\n\nBut the formalization of the original sentence would be the negation of the existence. So the correct way is to take the negation outside the existential quantifier. So \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx)). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx)), which can be further transformed using quantifier duality. The negation of \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx) is \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u00acQyx). So the formula can also be written as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u00acQyx)).\n\nBut the problem says to use the given abbreviations and to return a single well-formed formula. The user didn't specify whether to push the negation in or keep it as a negation of the existential. However, the example given uses a universal quantifier with an implication. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they used implication for the universal quantifier. Therefore, perhaps the expected answer is the first form, keeping the negation outside.\n\nSo the original statement is \"There is not a monkey that every human kicked.\" So the direct translation would be \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx)). However, sometimes in logic, it's preferable to have the negation pushed in, but the problem says to use standard syntax. Let me verify.\n\nThe sentence is equivalent to saying \"For every monkey, it is not the case that every human kicked it.\" Which would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx)). Which is equivalent to the previous formula because of the negation of the existential. But which form is expected here? The example uses a universal with implication, so perhaps the answer should be in the form with the universal quantifier and the negation inside.\n\nWait, the original sentence is a negation of an existential, so the direct translation is \u00ac\u2203x(...). But maybe the problem expects that form. Let me think. The example uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is the standard way to express \"All L are R to c.\" Similarly, here, the original sentence is \"There is not a monkey that every human kicked,\" which is the negation of \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx)). So the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx)).\n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence between \u00ac\u2203 and \u2200\u00ac, it can be written as \u2200x\u00ac(Ox \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx)), which can be further rewritten as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx)). But which one is the correct answer? The problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are correct, but perhaps the first form is more direct.\n\nBut let's check the abbreviations. The sentence is about \"there is not a monkey that every human kicked.\" So the structure is: \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 (\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx))). So the answer would be \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyx)). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects moving the negation inside. Let's see. The example uses implication with the universal quantifier. So if we have \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyx), that's equivalent to \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u00acQyx). Therefore, the formula can also be written as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u00acQyx)). But which one is the correct answer here?\n\nThe problem says to use the abbreviations provided and return a single well-formed formula. The example uses implication with the universal quantifier. The original sentence is a negation of an existential, so the direct translation would be \u00ac\u2203x(...). However, the problem may prefer the form where all quantifiers are in their standard positions. But I need to see which one is more appropriate.\n\nIn the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). Similarly, if we have \"There is no linguist who admires everyone,\" that would be \u00ac\u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u2200y(Rxy)). So following that pattern, the answer here would be \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyx)). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyx)). \n\nBut let me check again. The sentence is \"There is not a monkey that every human kicked.\" So \"every human kicked\" refers to the monkey. So for a particular monkey x, every human y kicked x. The original statement says there's no such x. Therefore, the correct formalization is the negation of the existence of such an x. Hence, \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyx)). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyx)).\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyx))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is \"Hazel isn't a human only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" The abbreviations provided are N for \"[1] is a human\", c is Hazel, R is \"[1] chased [2]\", and b is Lewis.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is saying that Hazel not being a human (\u00acNc) only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis (\u00acRb b). Wait, because Lewis is the subject and object here, so R would be Rbb, meaning Lewis chased Lewis. So the negation is \u00acRbb.\n\nSo putting it together, \"Hazel isn't a human only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" becomes \u00acNc \u2192 \u00acRbb. But wait, let me check if I got the direction right. \"Only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So Hazel not being human (\u00acNc) can only happen if Lewis didn't chase himself. So if Hazel is not a human, then it must be that Lewis didn't chase Lewis. Therefore, the implication is \u00acNc \u2192 \u00acRbb. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might confuse \"if\" and \"only if\", but here the structure is \"A only if B\", which is A implies B. So yes, that's correct. So the formula would be \u00acNc \u2192 \u00acRbb. \n\nNow, checking the abbreviations again. Hazel is c, so Nc is \"Hazel is a human\". Therefore, \u00acNc is \"Hazel isn't a human\". Lewis is b, so Rbb is \"Lewis chased Lewis\", and \u00acRbb is \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\". \n\nSo the entire formula is \u00acNc \u2192 \u00acRbb. There are no quantifiers here because the sentence is about specific individuals (Hazel and Lewis), not making a general statement about all humans or anything. So no need for \u2200 or \u2203. \n\nI think that's all. Just need to write it using the symbols. Let me make sure there are no typos. The connective is \u2192, and the negations are properly placed. Yeah, looks good. The final formula should be \u00acNc \u2192 \u00acRbb.\n</think>\n\n\u00acNc\u2192\u00acRbb",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is: \"A monkey chased Hazel only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\" The abbreviations given are O for [1] is a monkey, R for [1] chased [2], c for Hazel, M for [1] is a donkey, and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The phrase \"only if\" usually translates to a conditional where the condition is necessary. So, \"A only if B\" becomes A \u2192 B. So here, the main structure is: If a monkey chased Hazel, then no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nNow, breaking it down. The first part is \"A monkey chased Hazel.\" Since \"A monkey\" is existential, but in the original example, \"Every linguist...\" used a universal quantifier. Wait, here it's \"A monkey\", which is an existential statement. Wait, but \"A monkey chased Hazel\" would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc). Because there exists some x that is a monkey and chased Hazel. But the original example used a universal for \"Every linguist\", so maybe here, since it's \"A monkey\" (i.e., there is a monkey), we need an existential quantifier for the monkey part.\n\nBut the \"only if\" part is the conditional. So the entire statement is: If there is a monkey that chased Hazel, then it is not the case that any donkey chased Alfred. Wait, \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" would be \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Rya). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acRya).\n\nSo putting it together: The entire statement is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Rya). Alternatively, we can write the negation as a universal. But which form is better? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so both are acceptable, but perhaps using the negation of the existential is more direct here.\n\nSo the formula would start with: \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Rya). Alternatively, moving the negation inside, it's equivalent to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acRya). Either form is logically equivalent, but the problem might expect one or the other. Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" was translated as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So for the \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" part, the example would use the universal quantifier. Let me think. The negation of \"some donkey chased Alfred\" is \"no donkeys chased Alfred\", which is \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acRya). So perhaps that's the better way to write it.\n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acRya)\n\nLet me verify. The original sentence says that if a monkey chased Hazel, then there are no donkeys that chased Alfred. So the antecedent is the existence of a monkey chasing Hazel, and the consequent is the absence of any donkey chasing Alfred. So the translation seems correct.\n\nWait, but the original sentence is \"A monkey chased Hazel only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\" So \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So the necessary condition is \"no donkeys chased Alfred\", meaning that for the monkey to have chased Hazel, it must be that no donkeys chased Alfred. Therefore, the structure is indeed (monkey chased Hazel) \u2192 (no donkeys chased Alfred). Which translates to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acRya). Alternatively, \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Rya). Both are equivalent, but perhaps the problem expects the universal quantifier form. Let me check the example again. The example used a universal quantifier for \"Every linguist\", but here, the consequent is a universal statement. So yes, using the universal would be consistent with the example's approach. Therefore, the correct formalization would be:\n\n\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 \u00acRya)\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check for any possible errors. Are there any other interpretations? For example, could the sentence mean that whenever a monkey chased Hazel, then no donkeys chased Alfred? But since \"a monkey\" is singular, but the antecedent is an existential, meaning there exists a monkey that did it. The consequent is a universal statement about all donkeys not chasing Alfred. So the formula is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 \u00acRya)",

The sentence to formalize is: \"Alfred isn't a human or every donkey chased Alfred.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"is a human,\" a for Alfred, M for \"is a donkey,\" and R for \"chased.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The sentence is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) between two parts: \"Alfred isn't a human\" and \"every donkey chased Alfred.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Alfred isn't a human.\" Since N stands for \"is a human,\" and a is Alfred, the negation would be \u00acNa. That's straightforward.\n\nThe second part is \"every donkey chased Alfred.\" In predicate logic, \"every donkey\" translates to a universal quantifier \u2200x. Then, for each x, if x is a donkey (Mx), then x chased Alfred (Ra). So, the structure would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is the disjunction of these two parts. So, we combine \u00acNa with \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) using the logical OR symbol (\u2228). Therefore, the formalization should be \u00acNa \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa).\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any quantifiers or connectives. The original sentence uses \"or,\" which is correctly represented by \u2228. The universal quantifier is correctly applied to the donkey part. Also, the order of the disjuncts is important here. The first part is about Alfred not being human, the second about all donkeys chasing him. No other abbreviations are needed, and the variables are properly used.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the sentence is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" And we need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. So the overall form should be A \u2192 B. \n\nStarting with the antecedent, \"a human chased Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, N is \"[1] is a human\" and R is \"[1] chased [2]\". Lewis is denoted by b. So \"a human chased Lewis\" would be an existential statement, right? Because it's saying there exists some human who chased Lewis. So that would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). Wait, or is it just \u2203x (Nx \u2192 Rxb)? No, I think for statements like \"a human did something,\" you need to say there exists a human who did it. So existential quantifier with conjunction: \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). \n\nNow the consequent: \"every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The \"only if\" part is important. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, the statement is that for every monkey, if it is hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred. Wait, but \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" So the whole thing is that if every monkey is hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred? Or is it that each monkey's being hungry is only if Alfred saw Alfred? Let me think. \n\nThe structure is \"every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" So \"only if\" here applies to each instance. So for every monkey, if it is hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred. Because \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So for each monkey m, Lm \u2192 (Pa \u2227 Pa?), wait, no. The \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is Paa, since P is [1] saw [2], so Alfred (a) saw Alfred (a). \n\nSo the consequent is: For all x, if O(x) (x is a monkey), then L(x) \u2192 P(a,a). Wait, but the original sentence says \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" So the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the sufficient condition? Wait, no. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if we have \"Every monkey is hungry only if C\", then it's equivalent to saying that if every monkey is hungry, then C. But that would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 C. But another interpretation is that for each monkey, being hungry only if C. Which would be \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 C). \n\nWhich is correct? Let's take an example. Suppose the sentence is \"Every student passed only if the exam was easy.\" The correct translation would be that if every student passed, then the exam was easy. But another way might be that each student's passing requires the exam was easy. So if a student passed, then the exam was easy. Which is stronger. \n\nIn the original sentence, \"every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" If we take the \"only if\" as applying to each monkey's hunger, then it would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 Paa)). Because for each monkey x, if x is hungry, then Paa. Alternatively, since Paa is a single proposition, if any monkey is hungry, then Paa must hold. \n\nBut the original sentence is \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" which might mean that the entire condition of all monkeys being hungry is only if Paa. So if all monkeys are hungry, then Paa. That would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 Paa. \n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the exact wording. The original is \"every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The structure is similar to \"All A are B only if C.\" How is that usually translated? \n\nIn logic, \"All A are B only if C\" can be read as \"If all A are B, then C.\" So that would be (\u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x))) \u2192 C. Alternatively, if it's \"Each A is B only if C,\" then it would be \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 (B(x) \u2192 C)), which simplifies to \u2200x ((A(x) \u2227 B(x)) \u2192 C). \n\nBut in our case, the sentence is \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" So \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent of the only if. So it's like \"If every monkey is hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred.\" Therefore, the consequent would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 Paa. \n\nBut wait, the original sentence is part of a larger conditional. The entire sentence is: If [a human chased Lewis], then [every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred]. \n\nSo putting it together: The antecedent is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb), and the consequent is [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Paa]. \n\nBut let me check again. Suppose the consequent is \"every monkey is hungry only if Paa\". How to translate that? \n\nIf we take \"only if\" as a material implication, then \"every monkey is hungry only if Paa\" is equivalent to \"If every monkey is hungry, then Paa.\" So that's (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 Paa. \n\nAlternatively, if the structure was \"Every monkey is (hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred)\", then that would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2194 Paa))? No, because \"only if\" is one direction. So \"hungry only if Paa\" is Lx \u2192 Paa. So if we parse it as \"For every monkey x, x is hungry only if Paa\", then it's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 Paa)), which simplifies to \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Paa). \n\nBut which interpretation is correct? The original sentence is ambiguous, but in natural language, \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" could be read either way. However, considering that \"only if\" typically scopes over the immediate clause, perhaps it's the second interpretation. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the sentence is \"Every student passed only if the exam was easy.\" This could mean that if every student passed, then the exam was easy. Or it could mean that each student's passing required the exam to be easy. The latter is stronger. For example, if even one student passed, then the exam was easy. Which is a stronger condition. \n\nIn the original problem, the sentence is part of a conditional. So maybe the intended meaning is that if there exists a human who chased Lewis, then whenever a monkey is hungry, Alfred saw himself. Because if the consequent was (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 Paa, then even if some monkeys are hungry and some aren't, as long as all are hungry, then Paa must hold. But if the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 Paa)), then whenever any monkey is hungry, Paa must hold. \n\nBut how to determine which is correct? Let's look at the original sentence structure. The phrase is \"every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The \"only if\" is modifying the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" part. So if \"every monkey is hungry\" is true, then \"Alfred saw Alfred\" must be true. So that would be the first interpretation: (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 Paa. \n\nAlternatively, if the sentence was \"Every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred,\" it might be read as \"For every monkey, if it is hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred,\" which is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 Paa)). Since Paa is a proposition that doesn't involve x, this is equivalent to (\u2200x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Paa). But since Paa is a single proposition, if any monkey is hungry, then Paa must hold. \n\nWhich interpretation is more likely? In formal logic, \"only if\" is usually treated as a material implication. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. If A is a universal statement, like \"All monkeys are hungry,\" then it would be (All monkeys are hungry) \u2192 B. \n\nBut in the original sentence, the structure is \"If [human chased Lewis], then [every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred].\" So the consequent is a conditional where the antecedent is \"every monkey is hungry\" and the consequent is \"Alfred saw Alfred.\" \n\nTherefore, the consequent of the main conditional is (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 Paa. \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 Paa ]\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, we need to make sure that variables are properly quantified. Also, note that in the consequent, the \u2200x is using x again. But since the antecedent of the main conditional also has an \u2203x, we need to make sure that the variables are properly scoped. \n\nWait, in the antecedent, the \u2203x is bound, and in the consequent, the \u2200x is also using x. But since they are in different scopes, this is allowed. However, to avoid confusion, perhaps we should use different variables. But the problem says to return a single well-formed formula, and using the same variable is acceptable as long as they are in different scopes. \n\nAlternatively, to make it clearer, we can use a different variable in the consequent. For example, in the antecedent, \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), and in the consequent, \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly) \u2192 Paa. But since the problem doesn't specify variable names, using x again is acceptable. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Paa )\n\nBut in predicate logic, this is a valid formula. However, sometimes people prefer to avoid reusing variables in nested quantifiers for clarity, but it's not required. \n\nAlternatively, the consequent could be written as ( \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly) ) \u2192 Paa. But since the problem allows any well-formed formula, using x again is okay. \n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any other parts? The main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. \n\nSo the final translation is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 ( (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 Paa )\n\nBut let me check if there are any parentheses issues. The consequent is a material implication, so it's (A \u2192 B), where A is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) and B is Paa. \n\nYes. So the entire formula is correct. \n\nBut wait, another way to write implications: In logic, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So perhaps the formula can be rewritten. However, the problem requires using the given structure. \n\nAlternatively, the entire consequent is \"every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred,\" which we translated as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Paa. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Paa )\n\nBut let me check for any possible mistakes. \n\n- The abbreviations are correctly used: N for human, R for chased, b for Lewis, O for monkey, L for hungry, P for saw, a for Alfred. \n\n- The antecedent is \"a human chased Lewis\" which is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb). \n\n- The consequent is \"every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred,\" which is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Paa. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the final formula is as above. However, in standard predicate logic syntax, we need to make sure that all quantifiers are properly placed. Also, note that in the consequent, the implication is between the universal statement and Paa. \n\nAnother way to think about the consequent: The statement \"every monkey is hungry only if Paa\" can be considered as a conditional where the antecedent is the universal statement and the consequent is Paa. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx)\u2192Paa)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the sentence is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\" And we have to translate it into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence carefully. Let me break it down. The main structure seems to be a conditional statement. The first part is \"If a human chased Lewis,\" which would translate to something like \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), since N is \"x is a human\" and R is \"x chased y,\" so Rxb would be x chased Lewis (b). \n\nThen the consequence part is \"then Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is \u00acRbb (since R is \"chased,\" so Lewis chasing himself is Rbb, and the negation is \u00acRbb). The \"only if every human saw Hazel\" would then be \u00acRbb \u2192 (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc)), right? Because \"every human saw Hazel\" is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc), where P is \"saw,\" so Pxc is x saw c (Hazel).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence would be: If there exists a human who chased Lewis, then (if Lewis didn't chase himself, then every human saw Hazel). So the structure would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original sentence is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's exactly how I structured it. A is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), B is \u00acRbb, and C is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc). \n\nLet me make sure there are no quantifier issues. The first part is an existential quantifier for the human chasing Lewis. Then, in the consequent, the implication is from \u00acRbb to a universal statement about all humans seeing Hazel. \n\nI don't see any other abbreviations needed here. The constants are b for Lewis and c for Hazel. The predicates N, R, P are used correctly. \n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nI need to make sure that the parentheses are correctly placed. The entire existential statement is the antecedent of the main implication, and the consequent is the implication between \u00acRbb and the universal statement. Yes, that seems right. Also, the variables are properly quantified; the x in the existential is bound, and in the universal quantifier, the x is also bound. Since the existential and universal use the same variable x, but they are in different scopes, that's acceptable in predicate logic. \n\nI think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192(\u00acRbb\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))",

The sentence has two parts connected by \"and\": \"A human will attack\" and \"Alfred isn't asleep.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: \"A human will attack.\" In predicate logic, statements about \"a human\" usually involve an existential quantifier because it's referring to at least one human. So, there exists some x such that x is a human and x will attack. The abbreviation Nx would represent \"x is a human,\" and Gx would be \"x will attack.\" So, the first part should be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx). \n\nNext, the second part: \"Alfred isn't asleep.\" Since J is \"is asleep,\" and a is Alfred, this would translate to \u00acJa. \n\nNow, combining both parts with the conjunction \"and,\" which in logic is represented by \u2227.

So \"all monkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Px c). Because \"all monkeys\" are the ones being quantified, and each monkey (Ox) must have saw Hazel (Pxc). \n\nBut since the original says \"not all monkeys saw Hazel,\" that's the negation of the universal statement. So \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc) by moving the negation inside and converting the universal to an existential with conjunction. But the problem says to use the standard syntax, so maybe keeping it as \u00ac\u2200x... is acceptable unless there's a specific instruction to convert. However, the example given uses the universal quantifier directly, so perhaps we should stick with the negation of the universal.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is \u00acNc \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). \n\nLet me check if that's correct. The original sentence is \"Hazel isn't a human or not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" So yes, the disjunction between \u00acNc and the negation of the universal statement. \n\nI need to make sure that the abbreviations are used correctly. N is for \"is a human\", so Nc would be \"Hazel is a human\", hence \u00acNc is correct. O is for \"is a monkey\", so Ox is \"x is a monkey\". P is \"saw\", so Pxc is \"x saw Hazel\". \n\nTherefore, the formalization should be \u00acNc \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc). \n\nI don't think there's any other part to it. Let me check for possible mistakes. Did I mix up the order of the arguments in P? The abbreviation says P: [1] saw [2]. So if x saw Hazel, then it's Px c. Yes, because [1] is x, [2] is Hazel (c). So Pxc is correct. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula is the disjunction of \u00acNc and the negation of the universal statement about monkeys seeing Hazel.\n</think>\n\n\u00acNc\u2228\u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxc)",

The sentence to formalize is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey is hungry.\" The abbreviations provided are N for being a human, R for chasing, b for Lewis, Q for kicking, c for Hazel, a for Alfred, O for being a monkey, and L for being hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If a human chased Lewis, then [consequent].\" The consequent is a bit more complex: \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey is hungry.\" The \"only if\" here is a material implication. Remember that \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So, if we let P be \"Hazel kicked Alfred\" and Q be \"every monkey is hungry,\" then the consequent becomes Q \u2192 P? Wait, no. Wait, \"only if\" is a bit tricky. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" is logically equivalent to A \u2192 B. So in this case, \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey is hungry\" would be Q(c, a) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx)? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is: If a human chased Lewis, then (Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey is hungry). So the entire consequent is \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey is hungry,\" which is Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). Wait, but \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So Hazel kicking Alfred (Qca) only if every monkey is hungry (which is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx)? Wait, no. Wait, \"every monkey is hungry\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx)? Or is it \u2200x(Ox \u2227 Lx)? Wait, no. To say every monkey is hungry, we need that for all x, if x is a monkey, then x is hungry. So \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). So the consequent is Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). But the original sentence says \"If a human chased Lewis, then [this consequent].\" So the entire formula would be: If there exists a human who chased Lewis, then (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx)). Wait, but the antecedent is \"a human chased Lewis,\" which could be interpreted as \"there exists a human who chased Lewis.\" But the original sentence starts with \"If a human chased Lewis...\" So in formal terms, that's \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb). Because \"a human\" here is an existential quantifier. Wait, but sometimes \"a\" can be ambiguous. However, in formal logic, \"a human chased Lewis\" would typically be translated as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb), meaning there exists some human x such that x chased Lewis. \n\nPutting it all together: The entire sentence is a conditional where the antecedent is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb), and the consequent is (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx)). So the formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nBut we can also check if there's any scope issues. Let me make sure. The antecedent is about the existence of a human chasing Lewis. The consequent is a material implication: if Hazel kicked Alfred, then all monkeys are hungry. So the structure is correct. \n\nAnother thing to check: the use of quantifiers. The consequent's consequent is \"every monkey is hungry,\" which is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). That's correct. \n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nI need to make sure I didn't mix up the order. The original sentence says \"If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey is hungry.\" So the main implication is (antecedent) \u2192 (consequent), where consequent is Hazel's kick only if all monkeys are hungry. Which is Hazel's kick implies all monkeys are hungry. So yes, the consequent is Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx).

The sentence to formalize is: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me break it down.\n\nThe main conditional is \"If not all humans are asleep, then [Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel].\" The antecedent is \"not all humans are asleep,\" and the consequent is a \"only if\" statement. \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So the negation is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be written as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), but maybe the problem expects the negation of the universal quantifier directly. I'll go with \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) for now.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" here means that the statement \"Hazel kicked Alfred\" is true only if \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true. In logic terms, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, Qc a (Hazel kicked Alfred) implies \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c). Let me check: \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c). Alternatively, \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQx c). Again, whether to use the negated universal or the existential. The problem says to use the abbreviations given, so perhaps stick with the negation of the universal.\n\nPutting it together: The consequent is Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c). \n\nSo the entire sentence is: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [Qc a \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c)].\n\nWait, but sometimes in logic, implications can be rearranged. Let me check if the structure is correct. The original sentence is: If A, then (B only if C). Which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's what I have. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nLet me verify the abbreviations again. The abbreviations are:\n\nN: [1] is a human\n\nJ: [1] is asleep\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\n\nc: Hazel\n\na: Alfred\n\nM: [1] is a donkey\n\nSo Qca is Hazel (c) kicked Alfred (a). And Qxc is x kicked Hazel (c). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the formalization should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of the existential quantifier for the negated universals. Let me see: \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP. So \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). Similarly, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc). But the problem says to use the abbreviations provided and standard syntax. Since the example used \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), the problem might prefer to keep the negation outside the universal quantifier rather than converting to existential. However, in the example, they didn't have a negation. So maybe it's better to stick with the negated universal as in the example. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nI think that's the correct translation. Let me check again the original sentence structure. The consequent is \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" So \"only if\" is a material implication where the antecedent is the action (Hazel kicked Alfred) and the consequent is the condition (not all donkeys kicked Hazel). Therefore, Hazel kicked Alfred implies that not all donkeys kicked Hazel. Which is Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the entire formula is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(Qca\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is \"A unless B\". In logic, \"A unless B\" can be translated as \"A \u2228 B\", but sometimes it's also \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Wait, but I need to be careful here. Let me think. The original statement is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So, if it's not the case that all donkeys run, then Lewis will run. Alternatively, Lewis will run unless (it is not true that all donkeys run). So maybe it's equivalent to \"If not all donkeys run, then Lewis runs.\" So that would be \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx)) \u2192 Fb. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, \"A unless B\" is sometimes formalized as \"A \u2228 B\". So here, A is \"Lewis will run\" (Fb), and B is \"not all donkeys will run\" (which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx)). Wait, but if we take \"A unless B\" as \"A \u2228 B\", then it would be Fb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). But that might not capture the implication correctly. Because \"unless\" can be a bit tricky. Let me think of the meaning. The original sentence says that Lewis will run except in the case where all donkeys run. So if all donkeys run, then Lewis won't run? Or is it that Lewis will run unless it's not the case that all donkeys run. Wait, the original is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So the \"unless\" separates two conditions. So if the condition after \"unless\" is true (i.e., not all donkeys run), then Lewis must run. If the condition is false (i.e., all donkeys run), then Lewis might not run. So it's equivalent to: \u00ac(not all donkeys run) \u2192 Fb? Wait, no. Let me think again. \"A unless B\" is usually equivalent to \"if not B, then A\". So here, A is \"Lewis will run\", B is \"not all donkeys will run\". So \"Lewis will run unless B\" becomes \"if \u00acB, then A\". So \u00acB \u2192 A. So \u00acB is \"it is not the case that not all donkeys will run\", which simplifies to \"all donkeys will run\". Therefore, the formula would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Fb. Wait, but the original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So B is \"not all donkeys will run\". So the structure is A unless B, which is \u00acB \u2192 A. Therefore, \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx)) \u2192 Fb. Simplifying \u00acB, which is \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(...)) becomes \u2200x(...). So yes, \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Fb. Alternatively, the other way to think about it is that Lewis runs unless [condition], meaning that the condition is the case where he doesn't run. Wait, maybe I have it backwards. Suppose \"A unless B\" means that A is true except when B is true. So if B is true, then A is not necessarily true. But if B is false, then A must be true. So in logical terms, it's equivalent to A \u2228 B. Wait, no. Let me take an example. If I say \"I will go to the party unless it rains.\" So if it doesn't rain, I will go. If it rains, I might not go. So this is equivalent to \"If it does not rain, then I will go.\" Which is \u00acR \u2192 G. Alternatively, it's equivalent to G \u2228 R. But in some cases, the two might differ depending on context. However, in classical logic, \u00acB \u2192 A is equivalent to A \u2228 B. Because \u00acB \u2192 A is equivalent to B \u2228 A. So perhaps both approaches are valid. Let me check. For the given sentence, translating as \u00acB \u2192 A or A \u2228 B. Let me see what B is. B is \"not all donkeys will run\", which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). Therefore, A \u2228 B would be Fb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). Alternatively, \u00acB \u2192 A would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Fb. Both are equivalent. But which is the better formalization? Well, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. Let me check the abbreviations again. F is [1] will run, b is Lewis, M is [1] is a donkey. So the formula needs to use these. Now, the question is whether to use implication or disjunction. Since the original sentence is phrased as \"A unless B\", and in formal logic, \"A unless B\" is often rendered as \u00acB \u2192 A. However, since the user provided an example where \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), which is a straightforward universal implication, perhaps here the expected answer is using implication. Let me think again about the structure. The sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So the \"unless\" introduces a condition where Lewis doesn't run. Wait, no. If the condition after \"unless\" is true, then Lewis might not run. Wait, no. Let me think. If the sentence is \"A unless B\", then B is the exception. So normally A is true, except when B is true. So when B is true, A is not necessarily true. So the correct translation is that if B is not true, then A is true. So \u00acB \u2192 A. In this case, B is \"not all donkeys will run\", so \u00acB is \"all donkeys will run\". Therefore, if all donkeys will run, then Lewis will run. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. Let me think of an example. Suppose all donkeys run. Then according to the formula \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Fb, Lewis must run. But the original sentence says \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So if not all donkeys run (i.e., B is true), then the \"unless\" condition is met, which would mean that Lewis will run. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is A unless B. So if B is true, then A might not hold. But if B is false, then A must hold. So in the original sentence, if \"not all donkeys will run\" (B) is true, then Lewis will run. If B is false (i.e., all donkeys will run), then Lewis will run? Wait, that can't be. Because if B is false, then according to \u00acB \u2192 A, which would be \"if all donkeys run, then Lewis runs\". But the original sentence says \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So if not all donkeys run (B is true), then Lewis will run. If all donkeys run (B is false), then there's no constraint? Or does the sentence imply that Lewis will run in all cases except when not all donkeys run? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase the original sentence. \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So the only scenario where Lewis does not run is when not all donkeys run? No, that seems inverted. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of \"A unless B\" is that A is true except when B is true. So B is the exception. So if B is true, then A is not true. If B is false, then A is true. Therefore, the correct translation is \u00acB \u2192 A, and also B \u2192 \u00acA? Wait, no. Because \"A unless B\" does not necessarily mean that B implies not A. It could be that both A and B are true. For example, \"I will go to the party unless it rains.\" If it doesn't rain, I go. If it rains, I don't go. So here, B (it rains) implies \u00acA. But in some cases, maybe there are other reasons. However, in logic, \"A unless B\" is typically formalized as A \u2228 B, which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. But if you want to capture that B is the exception, you might need to also have that B \u2192 \u00acA. But that's not usually part of the standard translation. Let me check with the example. Suppose the original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So if not all donkeys run (B is true), then Lewis must run. Wait, that seems odd. If the \"unless\" is like \"except if\", then maybe it's better phrased as \"Lewis will run except if not all donkeys run.\" Which would mean that Lewis runs if all donkeys run, and does not run if not all donkeys run. But that would be B \u2194 \u00acA. Where B is \"not all donkeys run\". So B \u2194 \u00acFb. Which would be (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)) \u2194 \u00acFb. Which is equivalent to Fb \u2194 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx). But the original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So maybe the intended meaning is that Lewis will run if all donkeys run, but if not all donkeys run, then he will not? No, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the original sentence is ambiguous. Let me parse the original again. \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So the \"unless\" is separating two conditions. So \"Lewis will run\" is the default, unless the condition \"not all donkeys will run\" holds. Wait, that's confusing. Normally, \"A unless B\" means that A is true except when B is true. So if B is true, then A is not true. But here, the B is \"not all donkeys will run\". So if \"not all donkeys will run\" is true, then Lewis will not run? But that would mean Lewis runs only if all donkeys run. But the original sentence says \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So if the exception (not all donkeys run) occurs, then Lewis will run. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me try to think of it as \"Lewis will run unless [condition]\". The [condition] here is \"not all donkeys will run\". So the [condition] is the case where Lewis does not run. Therefore, if the [condition] is true (i.e., not all donkeys run), then Lewis does not run. If the [condition] is false (i.e., all donkeys run), then Lewis does run. Therefore, the correct translation would be \u00ac[condition] \u2192 Fb. Which is \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)) \u2192 Fb, simplifying to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Fb. But then, if the [condition] is true (not all donkeys run), then Lewis does not run. But the original sentence says \"Lewis will run unless [condition]\". So if [condition] is true, Lewis will run? No, that's the confusion. Let me think of it as \"A unless B\" meaning \"A is true if B is false, and maybe true or false if B is true.\" But in some cases, it might be that B being true makes A false. However, the standard logical translation is \u00acB \u2192 A. So for the given sentence, translating as \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)) \u2192 Fb, which is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Fb. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that Lewis runs only when all donkeys run, then it would be Fb \u2194 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx). But the original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So maybe it's better to think that Lewis will run if it's not the case that not all donkeys run (i.e., all donkeys run), and if not all donkeys run, then he might or might not run. But the original sentence uses \"unless\", which in some contexts can be exclusive. However, without more context, the safest formalization is to use the standard \"A unless B\" as \u00acB \u2192 A. Therefore, the formula would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Fb. Alternatively, if the user expects a different approach. Wait, another way to look at it: \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run\" can be rephrased as \"If it is not the case that all donkeys will run, then Lewis will run.\" Which is exactly \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 Fb. Wait, but that would be B \u2192 A, where B is \"not all donkeys will run\". But earlier analysis suggested that \"A unless B\" is \u00acB \u2192 A. Which would be \u2200x(...) \u2192 Fb. But if we rephrase the original sentence as \"Lewis will run if not all donkeys run\", then it's B \u2192 A. Which is different. So which is correct? Let me check with an example. Suppose all donkeys run. Then according to \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys run\", does Lewis run? The sentence says he will run unless the condition (not all donkeys run) holds. Since the condition doesn't hold (all donkeys run), then Lewis will run? Or does he not? If the \"unless\" is like \"except when\", then if the exception doesn't occur, the default holds. So if the exception is \"not all donkeys run\", then when the exception doesn't occur (all donkeys run), Lewis will run. But if the exception occurs (not all run), then Lewis might not. But the original sentence says \"Lewis will run unless [exception]\". So maybe the exception is the case where Lewis doesn't run. So if [exception] is true (not all run), then Lewis doesn't run. But that contradicts the original sentence's wording. Wait, this is getting really confusing. Let me try to use a truth table approach. Let's consider two scenarios: \n\n1. All donkeys run (\u00acB is true, B is false).\n   - What should happen to Lewis? According to the sentence, since the \"unless\" condition (B) is false, Lewis should run. So Fb is true.\n\n2. Not all donkeys run (B is true).\n   - What should happen? The sentence says \"Lewis will run unless B\". So if B is true, does that mean Lewis will run or not? The wording is ambiguous. But \"A unless B\" usually means that if B is true, then A is not necessarily true. But in this case, the original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So if not all donkeys run (B is true), then Lewis will run. Wait, that seems odd. Let me take an example. Suppose there are donkeys, and some don't run. Then according to the sentence, Lewis will run. But why would that be the condition? Maybe the intended meaning is that Lewis will run unless it's the case that all donkeys run. Wait, but the original sentence says \"unless not all donkeys will run\". Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the sentence should be \"Lewis will run unless all donkeys will run.\" That would make more sense, implying that if all donkeys run, then Lewis won't. But given the sentence as written, it's \"unless not all...\".\n\nAssuming the original sentence is correct, then when B (not all donkeys run) is true, Lewis will run. When B is false (all donkeys run), Lewis will run. Wait, that would mean Lewis always runs, which can't be right. That suggests that my translation is wrong. Because if B is false, then according to \u00acB \u2192 A (which is \u2200x(...) \u2192 Fb), then Fb must be true. And if B is true, then there's no constraint on Fb. But the original sentence says \"Lewis will run unless B\", which would mean that Lewis runs in all cases except when B is true? No, that's not right. Wait, no. If it's \"A unless B\", then A is true except when B is true. So when B is true, A is not true. But in our case, B is \"not all donkeys will run\". So when B is true (not all run), then A (Lewis runs) is not true. But the original sentence says \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" So this would mean that Lewis runs except when not all donkeys run, i.e., he runs only when all donkeys run. So the correct translation would be B \u2192 \u00acA, where B is \"not all donkeys run\", and A is Lewis runs. So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u00acFb. Which is equivalent to Fb \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx). But also, if B is false (all donkeys run), then A must be true. So \u00acB \u2192 A, which is \u2200x(...) \u2192 Fb. So combining both, we get Fb \u2194 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx). But the original sentence doesn't specify that Lewis must not run when B is true, only that he will run unless B. So maybe the correct translation is \u00acB \u2192 A, which is \u2200x(...) \u2192 Fb. But in that case, when B is true (not all run), Lewis may or may not run. But the original sentence says he will run unless B, which implies that when B is true, he doesn't run. So perhaps the correct translation requires both \u00acB \u2192 A and B \u2192 \u00acA, making it a biconditional. However, the original sentence doesn't explicitly state that. It only says that Lewis will run unless B. So the standard translation is \u00acB \u2192 A. But this leads to the problem that when B is true, A can be either true or false. But maybe in the context of the problem, we're to assume that the \"unless\" is exclusive, so that Lewis runs exactly when B is false. In that case, the biconditional would be needed. However, without explicit information, it's safer to stick with the standard \"A unless B\" as \u00acB \u2192 A. Given that in the example provided by the user, the translation of \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), which is a straightforward universal implication, perhaps the expected answer here is to use implication. \n\nSo, going back, the sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys will run.\" Translating \"unless\" as \"if not\", we get: If it is not the case that not all donkeys will run, then Lewis will run. Which simplifies to: If all donkeys will run, then Lewis will run. So \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Fb. That's one possible translation. Alternatively, if we take \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B, then it would be Fb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). Which is logically equivalent to \u2200x(...) \u2192 Fb. So both are acceptable. However, the example uses implication, so maybe the expected answer is the implication form. Therefore, the formalization would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 Fb.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)\u2192Fb",

The abbreviations are M for \"[1] is a donkey\", Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\", and a for Alfred. \n\nFirst, the sentence says that there is some donkey that performed the action of kicking Alfred. So, I should probably use an existential quantifier here because it's about the existence of a donkey. The structure would be something like \"There exists an x such that x is a donkey and x kicked Alfred.\"\n\nBreaking it down: The existential quantifier \u2203x. Then, the predicates. For x to be a donkey, that's Mx. Then, the kicking action: Q takes two arguments, the kicker and the kicked. So Qxa, since x kicked Alfred (a). \n\nSo putting it all together: \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa). \n\nWait, is there any other way to interpret this? Like, maybe if it were a universal quantifier, but no. The sentence is stating that at least one donkey did the kicking, not all donkeys. So existential makes sense. Also, the use of \"a donkey\" in English usually translates to an existential quantifier in logic. \n\nI should check if the predicates are correctly ordered. The Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\", so the first argument is the subject (the donkey), the second is the object (Alfred). So Qxa is correct. \n\nNo need for implication here because we're not saying \"if something is a donkey then it kicked Alfred,\" which would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ...).

        },
        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"If Alfred ate, then every monkey saw Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are I for \"[1] ate\", a for Alfred, O for \"[1] is a monkey\", P for \"[1] saw [2]\", b for Lewis, N for \"[1] is a human\", and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main structure is a conditional: If Alfred ate, then [some condition]. The [some condition] part is \"every monkey saw Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So, the entire \"only if\" part would mean that the statement \"every monkey saw Lewis\" is true only if \"every human saw Hazel\" is true. So, that part would be translated as (every monkey saw Lewis) \u2192 (every human saw Hazel).\n\nNow, breaking it down further. \"Every monkey saw Lewis\" can be formalized as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb). Because for all x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x saw Lewis (b). Similarly, \"every human saw Hazel\" would be \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc). For all y, if y is a human (Ny), then y saw Hazel (c).\n\nPutting that together, the \"only if\" part becomes \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc). But since variables are bound, we can reuse x in the second part. So maybe \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc). But variables are bound variables, so the name doesn't matter as long as they are bound correctly. So that's okay.\n\nNow, the entire original sentence is: If Alfred ate, then [that implication]. So the antecedent is Ia (Alfred ate), and the consequent is the implication we just built. Therefore, the whole formula should be Ia \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc)].\n\nWait, but in predicate logic, we need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly placed. Let me check again. The main connective is the implication from Alfred eating to the \"only if\" statement. The \"only if\" is an implication where the first part is \"every monkey saw Lewis\" and the second is \"every human saw Hazel\". So yes, that translates as (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pyc)). Since the variables x and y are bound, we can use x again in the second part. So it's okay to write \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc). But sometimes people use different variables for clarity, but logically it's the same. Since the problem allows any well-formed formula, using the same variable is acceptable as long as they are bound by their own quantifiers.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the entire formula is Ia \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc) ). However, in predicate logic, implications can be nested. But maybe we can simplify or rephrase it. Alternatively, using logical equivalences, but since the problem asks for a direct translation, we should stick to the structure of the original sentence.\n\nAnother thing to check: the original sentence says \"every monkey saw Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\" The \"only if\" here is connecting the two universal statements. So the structure is (Every monkey saw Lewis) only if (every human saw Hazel), which is equivalent to: If every monkey saw Lewis, then every human saw Hazel. Therefore, the consequent of the main conditional is that implication.\n\nSo the main formula is Ia \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc)) ). \n\nBut in predicate logic, this is a valid formula. However, sometimes people might prefer to have the quantifiers at the front, but in this case, since it's an implication between two universal statements, the structure is correct as is. \n\nTherefore, the final formalization should be:\n\nIa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc) )\n\nBut let me check if there's any possible misinterpretation. For example, could the original sentence be parsed differently? The sentence is \"If Alfred ate, then every monkey saw Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\" The \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey saw Lewis\" part. So yes, the structure is correct. The main conditional is Ia \u2192 [A \u2192 B], where A is \"every monkey saw Lewis\" and B is \"every human saw Hazel\".\n\nTherefore, the translation seems correct.\n</think>\n\nIa\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))",

So here, for each monkey, if it is hungry, then it must be the case that no donkeys ate. \n\nSo, the consequent is saying that for all x, if x is a monkey and x is hungry, then it's not the case that any donkey ate. Wait, but how to express \"no donkeys ate\"? That would be the negation of the existence of a donkey that ate. So \u00ac\u2203y (M y \u2227 I y). \n\nPutting it together: For every x, if O x (x is a monkey) and L x (x is hungry), then \u00ac\u2203y (M y \u2227 I y). \n\nBut wait, the original says \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" So maybe it's structured as: For all x, if O x, then (L x \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M y \u2227 I y)). \n\nSo combining these parts, the entire implication is: If Ia, then [for all x, (O x \u2192 (L x \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M y \u2227 I y)))]. \n\nLet me check if that's correct. The original sentence says that if Alfred ate, then whenever a monkey is hungry, there must be no donkeys that ate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the consequent is \"every monkey is hungry only if no donkeys ate\", which could be rephrased as: For all monkeys, if they are hungry, then no donkeys ate. So for all x, (O x \u2192 (L x \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M y \u2227 I y))). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the entire formula would be Ia \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)))].\n\nBut I should make sure about the scope of the quantifiers. The \"no donkeys ate\" is a universal statement? No, it's the negation of existence. So \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) is correct. \n\nLet me also check if the \"only if\" is correctly placed. The structure \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So for each monkey, being hungry (A) only if (B) no donkeys ate. So Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y... \n\nYes. Therefore, putting it all together, the formalization should be:\n\nIa \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)))\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"every monkey is hungry\" is the A part. Wait, no. The structure is \"every monkey is hungry only if no donkeys ate\". So the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the A in \"A only if B\". Wait, that might be a different parsing. Let me think again.\n\nThe sentence is \"every monkey is hungry only if no donkeys ate\". Let me parse this as: (For all monkeys, they are hungry) only if (no donkeys ate). But that would be different. Because \"only if\" connects two propositions. So if we take \"every monkey is hungry\" as A and \"no donkeys ate\" as B, then A only if B translates to A \u2192 B. \n\nBut that would mean: If every monkey is hungry, then no donkeys ate. But the original sentence is structured as \"If Alfred ate, then [every monkey is hungry only if no donkeys ate]\". So the consequent would be that implication. \n\nBut that would be different from my previous interpretation. Which is correct? \n\nThe original sentence is \"every monkey is hungry only if no donkeys ate\". Let's think about the meaning. It should mean that for a monkey to be hungry, it's necessary that no donkeys ate. So for each monkey, if it is hungry, then no donkeys ate. Which would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) ). But this is equivalent to \u2200x ( Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y... )).\n\nAlternatively, if we take the whole \"every monkey is hungry\" as A, then A \u2192 B, where B is \"no donkeys ate\". But \"every monkey is hungry\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). So the implication would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). \n\nBut that would mean that if all monkeys are hungry, then no donkeys ate. However, the original sentence seems to suggest that each monkey's being hungry depends on no donkeys having eaten. For example, if even one monkey is hungry, then no donkeys ate. Which is a stronger condition. But the original sentence's wording is \"every monkey is hungry only if...\", which could be ambiguous. \n\nBut in natural language, \"only if\" usually introduces a condition that must be met for each instance. For example, \"Every student passed only if the exam was easy\" would mean that for each student, if they passed, then the exam was easy. Not that if all students passed, then the exam was easy. The former is \u2200x (Student(x) \u2192 (Passed(x) \u2192 Easy)), whereas the latter is (\u2200x (Student(x) \u2192 Passed(x))) \u2192 Easy. These are different. \n\nIn our case, the correct interpretation is likely the first one: for each monkey, if it is hungry, then no donkeys ate. Because \"only if\" applies to each individual case. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization of the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))).\n\nPutting it all together with the antecedent Ia, the entire formula is:\n\nIa \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)))\n\nNow, let's check if we can simplify or reorder the quantifiers. The \u2203y is inside the implication. Also, note that the \u00ac\u2203y can be written as \u2200y \u00ac(My \u2227 Iy), but the problem allows using the given abbreviations and standard symbols. \n\nBut the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so either form is acceptable. However, since the example uses \u2203 and \u2200 as they are, I'll stick with \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy).\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\nIa \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)))\n\nI need to make sure that all the abbreviations are used correctly. The abbreviations are:\n\nI: [1] ate. So Ia is \"Alfred ate\".\n\nO: [1] is a monkey.\n\nL: [1] is hungry.\n\nM: [1] is a donkey.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formula uses all the abbreviations properly. Also, the variables are properly quantified. \n\nAnother thing to check: the order of the quantifiers. The \u2203y is inside the implication, so for each x, if Ox and Lx, then there does not exist a y that is a donkey and ate. \n\nYes, that seems right. \n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nIa \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)))\n\nWhich can also be written with parentheses adjusted for clarity, but in predicate logic, the arrows associate to the right, so maybe we can omit some parentheses, but to be safe, including them as I did.\n</think>\n\nIa\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Lx\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(My\u2227Iy)))",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is: \"Not all donkeys ate if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"is a donkey\", I for \"ate\", O for \"is a monkey\", R for \"chased\", and c for Hazel. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a biconditional (if and only if) between two parts: \"Not all donkeys ate\" and \"every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the left side: \"Not all donkeys ate.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys ate\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix). The negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix). Alternatively, using the equivalence that \"not all\" can be expressed as \"there exists at least one that doesn't,\" which would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). But which form is more appropriate here? Since the original is a direct negation of a universal quantifier, I think \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix) is correct. However, sometimes in logic, it's preferable to push the negation inside, so \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx) is equivalent. But maybe the problem expects the direct negation. Let me check. The example given uses the universal quantifier with implication. So maybe here, the left part is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix).\n\nNow the right side: \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"is a monkey\", R is \"chased\", and c is Hazel. So this would be \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Ryc). The variable here can be y or x, but since the left side uses x, maybe using a different variable to avoid confusion. But in predicate logic, variables are bound, so it's okay if they are different. However, in the final formula, the variables should be properly bound. So the right side is \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Ryc).\n\nPutting them together with the biconditional (\u2194): \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Ryc). But wait, variables in different quantifiers can use the same variable name as long as they are bound. For example, \u2200x P(x) \u2194 \u2200x Q(x) is acceptable because each x is bound in its own quantifier. However, sometimes it's clearer to use different variables. But the example uses x in both parts, like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So maybe here, the right side can use x as well. Let me adjust that. So the right side would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc). Then the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc).\n\nWait, but the original sentence uses \"if and only if\" between the two parts. So the structure is (Left) \u2194 (Right). That seems right.\n\nLet me verify each part again. \n\nLeft part: \"Not all donkeys ate.\" So \"all donkeys ate\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix). The negation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix). Alternatively, \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). But the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations for \"ate\" is I, so I think using the negation of the universal is acceptable here. The example uses a universal for \"Every linguist...\", so here \"Not all donkeys...\" is the negation of that structure.\n\nRight part: \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" That's straightforward. All monkeys (Oy) have chased Hazel (c), so \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Ryc). \n\nNow, combining them with \u2194. So the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Ryc). But variables x and y are just bound variables; they can be renamed. So maybe the answer expects both quantifiers to use x, even though they are separate. Let me check the example again. In the example, the formula is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). The right side of the biconditional here would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc). So yes, using x again is okay.\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc).\n\nWait, but in the original sentence, the left side is \"Not all donkeys ate\". Another way to think about \"Not all donkeys ate\" is \"There exists a donkey that did not eat\", which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). So maybe the problem expects that form. Which one is correct? The example uses the universal with implication for \"Every linguist...\", so the negation would be the existential with conjunction. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. Let me check the abbreviations again. The abbreviations for \"ate\" is I: \"[1] ate\". So the statement \"all donkeys ate\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix). The negation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix), which is equivalent to \u2203x\u00ac(Mx \u2192 Ix), which simplifies to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). So both forms are equivalent. But which one is preferred here? The example uses the universal form for \"Every linguist...\", so perhaps the problem expects using the negation of the universal quantifier rather than the existential. However, sometimes in logic, it's more standard to push the negation in. But the problem says to use the abbreviations given. Wait, the abbreviations don't include anything about \"not ate\"\u2014they just have I for \"ate\". So perhaps either form is acceptable. However, the example uses the universal with implication for the positive statement, so the negation would be the \u00ac\u2200... form. However, in the example, the right side of the biconditional is a universal. So maybe the problem expects the same approach here. \n\nBut I need to decide. Let me think. In the example, the sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So for \"Not all donkeys ate\", which is the negation of \"All donkeys ate\", which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). So that's the direct translation. However, sometimes people prefer to avoid starting with a negation of a universal. But the problem doesn't specify that. The instructions say to use the abbreviations given and return a well-formed formula. So both forms are correct, but perhaps the problem expects the \u00ac\u2200x(...) version here. \n\nTherefore, the left side is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix), and the right side is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc). So the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc). \n\nLet me check for any possible mistakes. The variables are properly bound. The connectives are correct. The abbreviations are used correctly. The biconditional is between the two parts. Yes, this seems right.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix)\u2194\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"No monkeys kicked a human.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main components are \"monkeys\" and \"kicked a human.\" The negation here is \"No,\" which usually translates to a universal quantifier with a negation inside. So, \"No A are B\" becomes \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 \u00acB(x)). But here the action is \"kicked a human,\" so it's about monkeys not doing that action towards humans.\n\nThe abbreviations given are O for \"[1] is a monkey,\" N for \"[1] is a human,\" and Q for \"[1] kicked [2].\" So, the structure should be something like for all x and y, if x is a monkey and y is a human, then x did not kick y. Wait, but maybe it's better phrased as there does not exist a monkey who kicked a human. Let me think.\n\nOriginal sentence: No monkeys kicked a human. So, there are no instances where a monkey kicked a human. That would be the negation of \"There exists a monkey who kicked a human.\" So, in logical terms, \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Qxy)). Alternatively, using universal quantifiers, it might be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). Let me check which one is correct.\n\nLet me recall that \"No A are B\" is \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 \u00acB(x)), but when it's about actions between two entities. So \"No A did C to B\" would be \u2200x \u2200y ((A(x) \u2227 B(y)) \u2192 \u00acC(x,y)). So in this case, for all x and y, if x is a monkey and y is a human, then x did not kick y. That would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). Alternatively, since the quantifiers can be moved, maybe it's equivalent to \u2200x \u2200y ((Ox \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nBut the original sentence is \"No monkeys kicked a human.\" So it's saying that there is no monkey who has kicked any human. So another way is to say that for all monkeys, they do not kick any human. So for every x, if x is a monkey, then for every y, if y is a human, then x does not kick y. That's the same as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). \n\nAlternatively, you could also express this as \u00ac\u2203x \u2203y (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2227 Qxy). Which is the negation of \"There exists a monkey x and a human y such that x kicked y.\" Both forms are logically equivalent. However, depending on the required form, sometimes one is preferred over the other. \n\nBut in predicate logic, the standard way to formalize \"No A are B\" in a relational context (like actions between two entities) is to use universal quantifiers. However, since the example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier with an implication, maybe the expected answer is using universal quantifiers. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So for \"No monkeys kicked a human,\" the structure would be similar but with negation. So perhaps using the universal quantifier approach.\n\nSo, the correct formalization would be that for all x and y, if x is a monkey and y is a human, then x did not kick y. So:\n\n\u2200x\u2200y((Ox \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy)\n\nAlternatively, using nested quantifiers:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy))\n\nBut since the example uses a single universal quantifier for x, maybe the expected answer uses a similar structure. However, since the action involves two entities (the kicker and the kickee), we need to quantify over both. \n\nAlternatively, the negation could be expressed as the absence of an existential statement. So \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Qxy)). Which is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)).\n\nBut which form is more standard? The problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are correct, but perhaps the first approach with universal quantifiers is better here. Let me think about how to structure it.\n\nIn the example, the formula was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is a universal quantifier over x, with an implication that if x is a linguist, then x relates to c. In the current problem, the relation is between two variables: the monkey and the human. So perhaps the correct approach is to use a universal quantifier over x (the monkey), and then for each x, if it's a monkey, then for all y, if y is a human, then x didn't kick y. So:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy))\n\nAlternatively, since the order of quantifiers can be switched in universals, this is equivalent to \u2200x\u2200y (Ox \u2192 (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)), which is the same as \u2200x\u2200y ((Ox \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy).\n\nSo both forms are acceptable. However, the problem may expect one of them. Let me check standard translations. For \"No A's are B's\" in a relation. Wait, here it's \"No A's did C to B's.\" So the standard way would be to say that for all A and B, A does not do C to B. Hence, \u2200x\u2200y (A(x) \u2227 B(y) \u2192 \u00acC(x,y)).\n\nSo in this case, \u2200x\u2200y (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). That would be the formula.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to use the implication structure as the example, perhaps \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). Either form is correct. But since the example uses a single universal quantifier, maybe the answer is expected to use nested quantifiers. However, in formal logic, both are equivalent. Let me check the example again. The example had a single universal quantifier over x and a constant c. Here, since we have two variables, perhaps the answer is \u2200x\u2200y... \n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both forms are well-formed. However, maybe the answer is expected to use the universal quantifier approach. Let me think about how to write it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \u00ac\u2203x\u2203y (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2227 Qxy). But that would be the negation of the existential. Which is equivalent to the universal statement. However, the example uses a universal quantifier, so perhaps the answer is expected to follow that pattern. \n\nBut the example was about a universal statement, and the current problem is a negative universal. But how to express that. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"No monkeys kicked a human.\" So it's equivalent to \"For all monkeys, they didn't kick any human.\" Which is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Qxy)). Which would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). \n\nSo that's the same as \u2200x\u2200y (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nTherefore, the answer is either of those forms. Now, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations are O, N, Q as given. So the formula would be:\n\n\u2200x\u2200y (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)\n\nAlternatively, using nested quantifiers:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy))\n\nBut which one is more standard? Both are correct. However, in the example, the formula was written with a single universal quantifier. Since the current problem requires two variables (because Q is a two-place predicate), perhaps the correct way is to use two universal quantifiers. \n\nIn standard predicate logic, the two are equivalent. So the formula can be written as \u2200x\u2200y ((Ox \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nTherefore, I think that is the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x\u2200y((Ox \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy)",

Wait, but how do I structure that?\n\nThe general structure for \"Every A B\" is \u2200x(Ax \u2192 ...). But here it's \"Every A saw every A.\" So maybe two universal quantifiers. So \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 Pxy))). Let me check.\n\nBreaking it down: For every x, if x is a donkey, then for every y, if y is a donkey, then x saw y. That would mean every donkey saw every donkey. Yeah, that seems right. So the formula would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Pxy)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quantifiers can be combined. But the structure is correct. Let me make sure. The predicate P is [1] saw [2], so Pxy is x saw y. So yes, the inner part is My \u2192 Pxy. Wait, but the outer part is Mx \u2192 the inner universal.

The sentence to translate is: \"If Alfred doesn't see Alfred, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" The abbreviations provided are P for \"[1] saw [2]\", a for Alfred, Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\", and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional statement: If (A), then (B). The antecedent (A) is \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred,\" and the consequent (B) is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred.\" Using the abbreviation P, which is a two-place predicate meaning \"[1] saw [2]\", so when both arguments are Alfred (a), it becomes Paa. Since the sentence says \"doesn't see,\" this should be the negation of Paa, so \u00acPaa.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" The predicate Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\", so with Alfred as the first argument and Hazel (c) as the second, it would be Qac. The negation here is \"didn't kick,\" so \u00acQac.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is a conditional where the antecedent is \u00acPaa and the consequent is \u00acQac.

There are no quantifiers here because all the subjects and objects are specific (Alfred and Hazel), so no need for \u2200 or \u2203. The predicates are applied directly to the constants a and c. So the final formula should be \u00acPaa \u2192 \u00acQac. I don't see any other elements needed here.

The main structure is \"Every human saw a monkey...\" So for every human, there's a monkey involved. Then the monkey \"saw it,\" where \"it\" refers back to the human, I think. So the monkey saw the human.\n\nBreaking it down: For every human x, there exists a monkey y such that x saw y, and y saw x. Wait, because \"a monkey that saw it\"\u2014the 'it' here is the human, since the human is the subject.

Then inside, we need that there exists a monkey y such that O(y) and P(x,y) (x saw y) and P(y,x) (y saw x).

The sentence is: \"If Hazel is hungry, then Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate.\" The abbreviations given are L for \"[1] is hungry\", c for Hazel, F for \"[1] will run\", b for Lewis, M for \"[1] is a donkey\", and I for \"[1] ate\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence carefully. The main structure seems to be a conditional: \"If Hazel is hungry, then [something].\" The \"something\" is \"Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate.\" Let's break that down.\n\nThe phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the part after the main \"if\" is saying that Lewis not running (\u00acFb) only if no donkeys ate. So that would be \u00acFb \u2192 (no donkeys ate). \n\nNow, \"no donkeys ate\" would be the negation of \"there exists a donkey that ate.\" So that's \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Alternatively, it can be written as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx), but I think the first form is more direct here since we're dealing with an existential quantifier's negation.\n\nPutting it together, the main conditional is Lc \u2192 [\u00acFb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)]. Wait, but the original sentence says \"Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate.\" So substituting, that's \u00acFb only if \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix), which translates to \u00acFb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). \n\nSo the entire formula would be Lc \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)). However, in logic, implications can be nested, but sometimes it's better to simplify. Also, note that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But here, the original structure is important. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal: If Hazel is hungry (Lc), then (Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate). The \"only if\" part is a material implication where the antecedent is Lewis not running. So yes, the structure is correct as Lc \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x...). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"only if\" is part of the main conditional. Wait, the sentence is \"If Hazel is hungry, then [Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate]\". So the main connective is the first \"if\", and the rest is the consequent. So the structure is correct.\n\nAnother way to think: The entire statement is Lc \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)). Let me make sure I'm not missing any quantifiers or connectives. The abbreviations are all used correctly here: Lc (Hazel is hungry), Fb (Lewis will run), Mx (x is a donkey), Ix (x ate). \n\nI should also check if there's any ambiguity. The original sentence says \"Lewis won't run only if no donkeys ate.\" So the \"only if\" is binding the \"no donkeys ate\" as the necessary condition for Lewis not running. So Lewis not running can only happen if no donkeys ate. Therefore, if Lewis doesn't run, then it must be that no donkeys ate. Which is exactly \u00acFb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). \n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization is:\n\nLc \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence of A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) being equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C, this could be written as (Lc \u2227 \u00acFb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). But the problem says to use standard syntax, and both are correct. However, since the original sentence structures it as a nested conditional, perhaps the first form is more accurate. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects the most straightforward translation without reordering. Let me stick with the original structure. So the final formula is:\n\nLc \u2192 (\u00acFb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nNow, checking the abbreviations again to make sure. Yes, all symbols are correctly used. No other abbreviations are present. The variables are properly quantified. The existential quantifier is negated correctly. \n\nI think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\nLc\u2192(\u00acFb\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Ix))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If Alfred won't attack, then no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B only if C. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again. The sentence is: If Alfred won't attack, then (no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate). Hmm, the \"only if\" part is inside the consequent of the main conditional. So maybe it's structured as: If \u00acG(a), then (\u00ac\u2203x(O(x) \u2227 Q(x,c)) only if \u00ac\u2203y(M(y) \u2227 I(y))).\n\nBut how to translate \"only if\"? In logic, \"P only if Q\" is usually translated as P \u2192 Q. So if we have \"A only if B\", that becomes A \u2192 B. So in this case, the consequent is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" only if \"no donkeys ate\". Let me rephrase that. Let me think: \"No monkeys kicked Hazel\" is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x(O(x) \u2227 Q(x, c)). The \"only if\" part would mean that this statement (no monkeys kicked Hazel) implies that no donkeys ate. Wait, no. Wait, \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So if the statement is \"P only if Q\", then P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. So in this case, \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" only if \"no donkeys ate\" would be: (\u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy)).\n\nSo putting it all together, the main conditional is: If \u00acG(a), then [ (\u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy)) ].\n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence is \"If Alfred won't attack, then no monkeys kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" So the \"only if\" is connecting the two parts of the consequent. So the structure is: If A, then (B only if C), which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's what I have above.\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations. G is [1] will attack, so \u00acG(a) is \"Alfred won't attack\". O is [1] is a monkey, Q is [1] kicked [2], so O(x) \u2227 Q(x,c) would be x is a monkey and x kicked Hazel. So \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc) is \"No monkeys kicked Hazel\". Similarly, M(y) is [1] is a donkey, I(y) is [1] ate, so \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy) is \"No donkeys ate\".\n\nTherefore, the entire formula should be: \u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy)).\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Let me make sure that the parentheses are correct. The main connective is the implication from \u00acG(a) to the entire \"only if\" statement. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a different interpretation? Let me think. Maybe the \"only if\" is part of the conditional. But I think the structure is as I have it. Let me test with an example. Suppose \"If it rains, then the ground is wet only if the sun is shining\" would be translated as Rain \u2192 (Wet \u2192 Shine). So yes, that's how it works.\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy))\n\nNow, I need to make sure that I'm using the abbreviations correctly. Let me check each part:\n\n- G(a): Alfred will attack. So \u00acG(a) is correct for \"Alfred won't attack\".\n- O(x): x is a monkey. Q(x, c): x kicked Hazel (since c is Hazel). So the existential quantifier negated is correct for \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\".\n- M(y): y is a donkey. I(y): y ate. So \u00ac\u2203y... is \"no donkeys ate\".\n\nYes, that seems right. So the formalization is as above. Now, I need to present it in standard syntax. Also, note that in some notations, variables can be reused, but here I used x and y, which is fine. Also, the order of quantifiers is okay since they're in different scopes. So the formula is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa\u2192(\u00ac\u2203x(Ox\u2227Qxc)\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(My\u2227Iy))",

The sentence is \"Only monkeys will attack.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"[1] is a monkey\" and G for \"[1] will attack.\" So, I need to translate this into predicate logic.\n\nFirst, \"Only monkeys will attack.\" That means that if something will attack, then it must be a monkey. Because \"only monkeys\" implies that being a monkey is a necessary condition for attacking. So, in logical terms, for any x, if Gx (x will attack), then Ox (x is a monkey). So the statement would be \u2200x(Gx \u2192 Ox). \n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. The general structure for \"Only A are B\" is \"If something is B, then it is A.\" So here, \"Only monkeys (O) will attack (G)\", so G is B and O is A. So yes, it's \u2200x(Gx \u2192 Ox). \n\nI need to make sure there's no other way to interpret it. Could it be that all monkeys will attack? No, because \"only monkeys will attack\" doesn't say that all monkeys do attack, just that if you attack, you must be a monkey.

The sentence is \"Every monkey kicked a human.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. \"Every monkey\" suggests a universal quantifier. So, for all x, if x is a monkey, then something happens. The abbreviations given are O for [1] is a monkey, N for [1] is a human, and Q for [1] kicked [2]. \n\nSo, the structure would start with \u2200x (Ox \u2192 ...). Now, the part after the implication is \"kicked a human.\" That means for each monkey x, there exists some human y such that x kicked y. So, existential quantifier here. \n\nSo inside the implication, it should be \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Qxy). Wait, because we need to say that there's a y who is a human and was kicked by x. Wait, no, the monkey kicked the human. So it's x kicked y. So Qxy where x is the kicker (monkey) and y is the kicked (human). So yes, \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Qxy). \n\nPutting it all together: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Qxy)). \n\nWait, but sometimes in these translations, when you have \"a human,\" it's possible that the human could depend on the monkey. So for each monkey, there exists some human they kicked. So the existential is inside the universal's scope. That's correct here. \n\nLet me check if there's another way. Could it be \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxy))? No, that would mean there's a single human that all monkeys kicked, which is not what the original sentence says. The original says each monkey kicked some human, possibly different ones.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"Every monkey chased Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" The abbreviations provided are O for being a monkey, R for chasing, a for Alfred, P for seeing, b for Lewis, and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"Every monkey chased Alfred.\" That seems straightforward. Using the example given earlier, for \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" they used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So here, since O is [1] is a monkey and R is [1] chased [2], the first part would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxa). That makes sense because every x that is a monkey (Ox) must have chased Alfred (a).\n\nThe second part is a bit trickier: \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" Let's parse this. The phrase \"it is not the case that\" translates to a negation, so \u00ac. Then \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" is another negation. So the structure is \u00ac(\u00acPb c). Because P is [1] saw [2], so \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" would be \u00acPb c. Then the whole thing is negated, making it \u00ac\u00acPb c. But double negation cancels out, so this simplifies to Pb c. Wait, but maybe I need to be careful here. The original sentence says \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel,\" which is equivalent to \"Lewis does see Hazel.\" So the translation would be Pbc (since Lewis is b and Hazel is c). But how to represent the original wording? The original wording uses two negations, but logically it's equivalent to just asserting Pbc. However, in formal logic, should I represent it as \u00ac\u00acPbc or just Pbc? Since \u00ac\u00acPbc is equivalent to Pbc, but the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Since P is \"saw,\" maybe the correct way is to translate the meaning, not the literal wording. But the instructions say to use the abbreviations given and return a well-formed formula. So perhaps I should represent the exact logical structure of the English sentence. The English sentence says \"it is not the case that [Lewis doesn't see Hazel].\" So that's \u00ac(\u00acPbc). Which simplifies to Pbc. But maybe the problem expects the double negation to be represented explicitly? Wait, the example given in the instructions for the example sentence uses the implication directly without simplifying. For example, if the sentence had said \"It is not the case that linguists don't admire Charlie,\" the formalization would be \u2200x(Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u00acRxc), which would be equivalent to \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). But in the example, they just used the direct implication. So perhaps in this case, even though there's a double negation, we can simplify it to Pbc. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given, and the original sentence's structure includes the double negative. Hmm. Let me check the original sentence again: \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" So the structure is \u00ac(\u00acPbc). But in logic, that's equivalent to Pbc. However, the problem might require translating the exact structure, not the simplified version. But the example didn't do that. For instance, if the example had been \"Every linguist doesn't not admire Charlie,\" would it be \u2200x(Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u00acRxc)? Or would it be simplified to \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc)? The example given uses the direct implication. So maybe the answer expects the simplified version here. Therefore, the second part is Pbc.\n\nNow, combining both parts. The original sentence is a conjunction of the two parts: \"Every monkey chased Alfred\" AND \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" So the entire formula would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 \u00ac(\u00acPbc). Which simplifies to \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 Pbc. Alternatively, if we keep the double negation, it's \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 \u00ac\u00acPbc. But since the problem says to use the abbreviations provided, and P is \"saw,\" then \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" is \u00acPbc. Therefore, \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" is \u00ac(\u00acPbc) which is equivalent to Pbc. Therefore, the correct formalization is the conjunction of \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxa) and Pbc.\n\nSo the final formula should be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxa) \u2227 Pbc. Let me check again. The first part is correct. The second part: the original says \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" So the inner part is \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" which is \u00acPbc. The outer negation makes it \u00ac\u00acPbc, which is Pbc. So the entire formula is the conjunction of the two. Therefore, the answer is \u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxa) \u2227 Pbc.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is \"A unless B,\" where A is \"Lewis will run\" and B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" In logic, \"A unless B\" can be translated as \"If not B, then A,\" or equivalently, \"B \u2228 A.\" So, I need to figure out what B is here.\n\nB is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" The phrase \"all donkeys kicked Lewis\" would be a universal statement. The negation of that would be the existential statement that there exists at least one donkey who did not kick Lewis. Wait, no. Let me think again. The original statement is \"all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" which in logic is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b), since Mx is \"[x] is a donkey\" and Qx b is \"[x] kicked Lewis (b).\" The negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b), which is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx b). So B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx b).\n\nSo putting it back into the \"A unless B\" structure. The translation could be B \u2228 A. Alternatively, \u00acB \u2192 A. Let me check which is more appropriate. Since \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"if not B then A,\" which is \u00acB \u2192 A. So here, if it's not the case that not all donkeys kicked Lewis (i.e., if all donkeys did kick Lewis), then Lewis will run. Alternatively, B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" so \u00acB would be \"all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Therefore, the implication would be that if all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis will run. So the entire formula would be: If \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b), then Fb. But the original structure is \"A unless B,\" which is A \u2228 B. Wait, another way: \"A unless B\" is equivalent to A \u2228 B. So maybe the correct translation is Fb \u2228 [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b)], which would be Fb \u2228 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx b). But let me think again. Let's recall that \"unless\" is typically translated as a disjunction. So \"A unless B\" is A \u2228 B. However, sometimes people might use material implication. Let me verify with examples. For example, \"I will go unless it rains\" can be translated as \"I will go \u2228 it rains.\" But another way is \"If it does not rain, then I will go,\" which is \u00ac(it rains) \u2192 I will go. These are logically equivalent. So both forms are acceptable. The choice between them depends on how we structure the formula.\n\nIn this case, the sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So A is \"Lewis will run\" (Fb), and B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" (which is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx b)). So \"A unless B\" would be A \u2228 B, which is Fb \u2228 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx b). Alternatively, \u00acB \u2192 A, which would be \u00ac(\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx b)) \u2192 Fb. The negation of \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx b) is \u2200x (\u00acMx \u2228 Qx b), which is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b). Therefore, \u00acB \u2192 A becomes \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 Fb. \n\nWhich of these is the correct formalization? Both are equivalent. However, depending on the convention, sometimes implications are preferred. But the problem says to use the abbreviations given. Let me check the example provided. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So they used implication for the universal statement. Therefore, perhaps here, using implication is better. Let me see. The original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So \"unless\" can be thought of as \"if not... then...\". So \"If not (not all donkeys kicked Lewis), then Lewis will run.\" Which simplifies to \"If all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis will run.\" So the formula would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. Alternatively, the disjunction would be Fb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). Both are equivalent. However, the example uses implication for universal statements, so maybe the former is better here. But the problem is to choose the correct structure. Let me think again. The user instruction says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are correct, but perhaps the example uses implication for universal statements, so maybe the implication form is preferred here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original sentence is more naturally phrased as a disjunction. Let's see: \"Lewis will run unless [condition].\" The [condition] here is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So if the condition is not met (i.e., all donkeys did kick Lewis), then Lewis will run. So that's the implication. But the disjunction is also correct. However, in formal logic, implications are often used when dealing with universal quantifiers. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So that's a universal statement with implication. In this case, the main connective in the answer would be implication if we go with the implication approach. But how to decide which form to use here?\n\nThe problem is that the original sentence is a bit ambiguous in structure. Let's rephrase the sentence: \"Lewis will run unless it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So \"unless\" here is like an \"or.\" So either Lewis runs, or it's not the case that all donkeys kicked him. So that would be Fb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). Which is equivalent to Fb \u2228 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). Alternatively, the implication form is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb? Wait no. Wait, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"If not B, then A.\" So if B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" then \"if not B, then A\" is \"if all donkeys kicked Lewis, then A.\" So that would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. So that's another way. Both forms are logically equivalent. \n\nBut which one is more appropriate here? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations are F: [1] will run (so Fb is Lewis will run), M: [1] is a donkey, Q: [1] kicked [2] (so Qxb is x kicked b, since b is Lewis). \n\nThe example uses implication for the universal statement. So perhaps the answer should follow the same pattern. Let me think. The user might expect the answer to be structured with implication. But I need to check which is the correct way. Let me think of an example. Suppose all donkeys kicked Lewis. Then according to the sentence, Lewis will run. If some donkey didn't kick him, then Lewis might not run. So the formalization should capture that if all donkeys kicked him, then he runs. So the implication form would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. Alternatively, the disjunction is Fb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). Both are equivalent. \n\nBut in predicate logic, which is more standard? Well, both are correct. However, the example given uses a universal quantifier with implication. Since the user provided that example, maybe they expect a similar structure here. However, in this case, the main connective is an implication. Let me check. The example's formalization was \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc), which is a universal statement. Here, the main connective is an implication between two statements: the antecedent is a universal statement, and the consequent is Fb. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is expected to use the disjunction. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" The \"unless\" can be directly translated as a disjunction. So \"Lewis will run OR not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Which is Fb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). Which is the same as Fb \u2228 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). \n\nBut in the example, the translation was a universal statement with implication. Here, the structure is different. The example had a universal statement, but here, the main connective is a disjunction or an implication. \n\nHmm. Let me think about the logical equivalence. The two forms are equivalent. So both are correct. However, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Since the example uses implication for the universal statement, but here, the main connective is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the implication form. Let me check the example again. The example's sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" which is a universal statement. The formalization was \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So that's straightforward. \n\nIn this case, the sentence is not a universal statement, but a conditional. So perhaps the answer should be an implication. \n\nBut how to decide? Let me think of the meaning. The original sentence says that Lewis will run if it is not the case that all donkeys kicked him. Wait, no. Wait, the original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So the \"unless\" is between \"Lewis will run\" and \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So \"A unless B\" means that if B is false, then A must be true. So if \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" is false (i.e., all donkeys did kick Lewis), then Lewis will run. Therefore, the implication is that if all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis will run. Which is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. \n\nAlternatively, the disjunction is Fb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). Both are equivalent. \n\nBut which form is more standard? In formal logic, both are acceptable. However, the example uses implication for universal statements. Since the antecedent here is a universal statement, maybe the implication is the way to go. \n\nSo I think the correct formalization is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. \n\nWait, but let's make sure. Let me check with a truth table. Suppose all donkeys kicked Lewis. Then the antecedent is true, so Fb must be true. If there's at least one donkey that didn't kick Lewis, then the antecedent is false, so the implication is true regardless of Fb. Which matches the original statement: if B (not all donkeys kicked Lewis) is true, then the \"unless\" condition is met, so Lewis may or may not run. But the original sentence says that Lewis will run unless B. So if B is true, then Lewis might not run. But if B is false (i.e., all donkeys kicked Lewis), then Lewis must run. \n\nYes, that's captured by the implication. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible interpretation. For example, could the sentence be read as \"Lewis will run unless (it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis)\" meaning that Lewis will run if either he is kicked by all donkeys or some other condition? No, the \"unless\" here is more like \"if not B then A\". \n\nSo I think the correct translation is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. \n\nNow, using the abbreviations provided:\n\n- F: [1] will run \u2192 Fb is \"Lewis will run\"\n- M: [1] is a donkey\n- Q: [1] kicked [2] \u2192 Qxb is \"x kicked Lewis\"\n\nSo the formula is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. \n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, the implication here is between the universal quantifier and Fb. So the entire universal statement is the antecedent, and Fb is the consequent. \n\nYes. So the well-formed formula would be (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb)) \u2192 Fb. \n\nBut in standard syntax, we can write it as \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. \n\nHowever, sometimes parentheses are important. Let me check the example again. The example was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which uses parentheses around the implication. So in this case, the antecedent is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb), and the consequent is Fb. So the formula is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a different approach? Let me think again. Suppose someone interprets \"unless\" as \"or,\" leading to Fb \u2228 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). That would also be correct. But which one is expected here? \n\nThe example uses a universal statement with implication. The problem might prefer the implication form here. However, both are logically equivalent. But since the example uses implication for universal statements, perhaps the answer should follow that style. \n\nBut let me verify the equivalence. \n\nThe statement \u2200x (A \u2192 B) \u2192 C is equivalent to \u2203x (A \u2227 \u00acB) \u2228 C. Because \u00ac\u2200x (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to \u2203x \u00ac(A \u2192 B), which is \u2203x (A \u2227 \u00acB). Therefore, \u2200x (A\u2192B) \u2192 C is equivalent to \u2203x (A \u2227 \u00acB) \u2228 C. So both forms are equivalent. \n\nSo the answer could be written either way. However, the example uses the implication form for the universal statement, but here, the main connective is different. \n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are acceptable. However, since the example uses implication, maybe the answer should use implication here. \n\nBut wait, in the example, the entire formula was a universal statement. Here, the formula is an implication between a universal statement and an atomic formula. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the disjunction form. Let me think. The original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" The \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). So the disjunction would be Fb \u2228 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). Which is also a valid formalization. \n\nBut which one is more direct? The example uses implication for universal statements. Here, since the main connective is \"unless,\" which is a disjunction, perhaps the disjunction is more direct. \n\nBut the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are standard. \n\nHmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. Let me check the meaning again. The original sentence says that Lewis will run if it's not the case that all donkeys kicked him. Wait, no. The original sentence is \"Lewis will run unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So the \"unless\" is between \"Lewis will run\" and \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So the structure is \"A unless B,\" which is \"A \u2228 B.\" So the correct translation would be Fb \u2228 B, where B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" \n\nSo B is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). Therefore, the formula is Fb \u2228 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). \n\nAlternatively, since B is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb), the formula is Fb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nBut which form is better? The example uses the implication form for universal statements, so perhaps the answer should use the implication form here as well. However, since the main connective here is a disjunction, maybe it's better to write it as a disjunction. \n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations include M and Q, so both forms are possible. \n\nBut let's look at the example again. The example's sentence was a universal statement, and the formalization used the implication inside the universal quantifier. Here, the sentence is not a universal statement, but a conditional. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is the implication form: \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Let me think of another example. Suppose the sentence was \"I will go to the party unless it rains.\" The formalization could be \"Go \u2228 Rain\" or \"\u00acRain \u2192 Go.\" Both are correct. Similarly, here, both forms are correct. \n\nSince the problem allows any well-formed formula, and both are correct, but the example uses implication for universal statements, perhaps the answer should follow the implication form here. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct formalization is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb. \n\nBut to double-check, let's consider the meaning. If all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis will run. If not all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis may or may not run. The formalization captures that. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 Fb.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\u2192Fb",

The sentence is \"Lewis saw Lewis if and only if not all humans kicked Alfred.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a biconditional (if and only if) between two parts: \"Lewis saw Lewis\" and \"not all humans kicked Alfred.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Lewis saw Lewis.\" The abbreviation for \"saw\" is P, which takes two arguments. Since both the subject and object are Lewis, represented by 'b', this should be Pbb. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow the second part: \"not all humans kicked Alfred.\" The negation of \"all humans kicked Alfred.\" Let's think about how to express \"all humans kicked Alfred.\" Using the abbreviation N for \"[1] is a human\" and Q for \"[1] kicked [2].\" So \"all humans kicked Alfred\" would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxa), because for every x, if x is a human, then x kicked Alfred (a). The negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxa). But sometimes, it's preferable to push the negation inside using quantifier duality. The negation of \"for all\" is \"there exists at least one\" such that the opposite holds. So \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxa) is equivalent to \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acQxa). But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax. Since the original instruction says to use standard logical symbols, either form is acceptable. However, the direct translation of \"not all\" is usually the negation of the universal quantifier, so \u00ac\u2200x(...). But maybe the problem expects that form. Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the direct translation of \"not all\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(...). Therefore, here, \"not all humans kicked Alfred\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxa). \n\nPutting it all together, the biconditional between Pbb and \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxa). So the entire formula should be Pbb \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxa). \n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to write it with the negation distributed, it would be Pbb \u2194 \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acQxa). But I need to check if the problem expects the most direct translation. The sentence says \"not all...\", which directly translates to the negation of the universal statement. The example uses a universal quantifier with implication for \"every\", so following that, the correct form here would be \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxa). \n\nTherefore, the final formula is Pbb \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxa). Let me double-check the abbreviations. P is [1] saw [2], so Pbb is correct for Lewis saw Lewis. N is [1] is a human, Q is [1] kicked [2], a is Alfred. Yes.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"A monkey kicked a monkey that kicked a human.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations: O for monkey, N for human, Q for kicked.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. There's a monkey who kicked another monkey, and that other monkey kicked a human. So it's like a chain of two actions. The first monkey is a monkey, the second monkey is also a monkey, and the human is a human.\n\nSo, I need to express that there exists at least one monkey (let's call it x) who kicked another monkey (let's say y), and that monkey y kicked a human (z). So, existence of x, y, z such that O(x), O(y), N(z), and the kicking relations: Q(x,y) and Q(y,z).\n\nBut wait, the original sentence says \"a monkey kicked a monkey that kicked a human.\" The \"that\" here introduces a relative clause, so the second monkey is the one that did the kicking towards the human. So the structure is: there exists x and y where x is a monkey, y is a monkey, and x kicked y, and there exists a z (human) such that y kicked z. Wait, but do I need to have three variables here?\n\nYes, I think so. So the entire thing would be \u2203x \u2203y \u2203z (O(x) \u2227 O(y) \u2227 N(z) \u2227 Q(x,y) \u2227 Q(y,z)). But maybe I can combine the existentials. Since they are all existential, I can nest them. So maybe \u2203x (O(x) \u2227 \u2203y (O(y) \u2227 \u2203z (N(z) \u2227 Q(x,y) \u2227 Q(y,z))))). But in predicate logic, multiple existential quantifiers can be written as \u2203x \u2203y \u2203z... So the standard way is to have them all at the front. So the formula would be \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z (Ox \u2227 Oy \u2227 Nz \u2227 Qxy \u2227 Qyz). Let me check that again.\n\nOriginal sentence: There is a monkey (x) who kicked a monkey (y) who (y) kicked a human (z). So x and y are monkeys, z is human. The actions are x kicks y, and y kicks z. So yes, the formula should have all three variables with those predicates and the two Qs. So the correct formalization would be the existence of x, y, z with those properties. I think that's it. Let me make sure I didn't miss any part. The sentence doesn't say that the first monkey kicked the human directly, just that through the second monkey. So this should capture that chain.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(Ox\u2227Oy\u2227Nz\u2227Qxy\u2227Qyz)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is a donkey only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence into parts. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, actually, the sentence is \"If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is a donkey only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So the structure is \"If [A], then [B only if C]\". \n\nLet me recall that \"only if\" in logic translates to an implication where the consequent is the \"only if\" part. So \"B only if C\" would be B \u2192 C. So the entire sentence is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). \n\nNow, let's identify each part:\n\nA: Not all humans are asleep. In predicate logic, \"not all\" is equivalent to \"there exists at least one human who is not asleep.\" So A is \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 \u00acJ(x)). Because \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 J(x)), so the negation is \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 \u00acJ(x)).\n\nB: Lewis is a donkey. Using the abbreviations, that's M(b), since M is \"[1] is a donkey\" and b is Lewis.\n\nC: No monkeys kicked Hazel. The negation of \"some monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So C is \u00ac\u2203x (O(x) \u2227 Q(x, c)), where O is \"[1] is a monkey\", Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\", and c is Hazel. Alternatively, this can be written as \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)).\n\nPutting it all together, the main implication is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Substituting the parts:\n\nA is \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 \u00acJ(x)), B is M(b), C is \u00ac\u2203x (O(x) \u2227 Q(x, c)) or \u2200x (O(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)). \n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc))\n\nAlternatively, using the universal quantifier version for C:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nEither form is correct, but the problem might prefer one over the other. The original instruction says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviation for \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" would be the negation of \"some monkeys kicked Hazel\", which is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). So the negation is \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc), which is equivalent to \u2200x(\u00acOx \u2228 \u00acQxc), which is the same as \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). Either way is acceptable, but perhaps the problem expects the use of the negated existential form. However, in formal logic, both are equivalent. Let me check the example given. In the example, they used Rxc for \"admires\", so when translating \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\", using the negation of the existential quantifier would be appropriate here.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc))\n\nBut I need to make sure that variables are properly quantified. Wait, in the antecedent, the \u2203x is for humans, but in the consequent's C part, the \u2203x is for monkeys. However, in predicate logic, variables are bound within their own scope. So the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent are different variables. But when writing the formula, we need to ensure that variables don't clash. Wait, actually, when we have multiple quantifiers, we can use different variables. But in the problem's case, the two existentials are separate. Let me think: the antecedent is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), then the consequent is Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). Using different variables (x and y) to avoid confusion. However, in formal logic, the same variable can be used if they are in different scopes. But to prevent confusion, it's better to use different variables. However, the problem might not require that. Let me check the example again. In the example, they used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the same x is used. So perhaps the problem allows for reusing variables in different scopes. Therefore, in our case, even if both the antecedent and the consequent use x, it's acceptable because they are in different scopes. Therefore, the formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc))\n\nAlternatively, using a different variable for the second existential, like z:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203z(Oz \u2227 Qzc))\n\nBut the problem didn't specify to avoid variable reuse, so both are correct. However, since the example uses x consistently, perhaps it's acceptable here. \n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc))\n\nBut wait, in the consequent, the \u00ac\u2203x is part of the implication's consequent. Let me write the entire implication correctly. The main connective is the implication from the antecedent to the consequent. The consequent is (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(...)). \n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc))\n\nAlternatively, using the universal quantifier:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nWhich is equivalent. The problem might prefer one form over the other. Let me check the abbreviations again. The abbreviation for \"kicked\" is Q: \"[1] kicked [2]\". So the statement \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is \"For all x, if x is a monkey, then x did not kick Hazel\", which is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). Therefore, perhaps the problem expects the universal quantifier version. \n\nSo the correct formalization would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nBut here, the variable x is used in both the antecedent and the consequent. However, in the consequent, the \u2200x is binding a new x. So in the entire formula, there are two different x variables, each bound in their own scope. That's acceptable in predicate logic. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nBut some might argue that reusing x could be confusing. However, in formal logic, it's allowed as long as the scopes don't overlap. Since the \u2203x in the antecedent and the \u2200x in the consequent are separate, it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nAlternatively, using a different variable for the universal quantifier, like y:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc))\n\nBut again, the problem's example uses x in multiple places, so perhaps it's acceptable here. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps using a different variable for the universal quantifier is better. However, since the problem didn't specify, and the example uses x, I'll proceed with that.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate.\" The abbreviations provided are R for chasing, b for Lewis, O for being a monkey, J for being asleep, M for being a donkey, and I for ate.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If P, then Q. So P is \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis,\" and Q is \"every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate.\"\n\nStarting with P: \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" Since R is \"[1] chased [2]\" and b is Lewis, this would be \u00acRbb. Because both the subject and object are Lewis, we use the same constant twice.\n\nNow Q: \"every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So if we have \"every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate,\" it would mean that if any monkey is asleep, then no donkeys ate. Wait, but the original statement is about every monkey being asleep. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the phrase \"every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate\" can be parsed as: If no donkeys ate, then every monkey is asleep? No, because \"only if\" reverses that. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So in this case, the entire statement \"every monkey is asleep\" is the A, and \"no donkeys ate\" is B. Therefore, the implication is (every monkey is asleep) \u2192 (no donkeys ate). Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. Let me check an example. Suppose the statement is \"You can have dessert only if you finish your dinner.\" That translates to \"If you have dessert, then you finished your dinner.\" So applying that logic here, \"every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate\" would mean that if every monkey is asleep, then no donkeys ate. But the original sentence says that this is the case under the condition that Lewis didn't chase Lewis. Hmm, but maybe I got the direction wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the \"only if\" is being used in a way that the entire conditional is structured as Q \u2192 B, where Q is the consequent of the main implication.\n\nWait, the main structure is: If \u00acRbb, then [Q]. And Q is \"every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate.\" Let me rephrase Q. The phrase \"every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate\" can be read as \"For the case that every monkey is asleep, it is necessary that no donkeys ate.\" Which again translates to (every monkey is asleep) \u2192 (no donkeys ate). So Q is that implication.\n\nNow, let's formalize each part. First, \"every monkey is asleep\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx). Because for all x, if x is a monkey, then x is asleep.\n\nThen, \"no donkeys ate\" would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Which is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Either way is acceptable, but perhaps using the negation of existence is more direct here.\n\nSo putting Q together: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Alternatively, \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Both are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acRbb \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix)].\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Let me check the structure again. The main conditional is \u00acRbb \u2192 (Q), and Q is the implication between the two parts. So the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix)) )\n\nAlternatively, using the universal quantifier for the \"no donkeys ate\" part, it would be \u00acRbb \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 (\u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy)) )\n\nBut the problem says to use the given abbreviations. Since M is \"[1] is a donkey\" and I is \"[1] ate\", the correct way is to express that for all donkeys, they did not eat. So \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy). Alternatively, \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). Either is acceptable, but perhaps the existential negation is more straightforward here.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main formula is:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, when you have implications, you can sometimes rephrase them. Also, note that the variables x and y can be the same or different; since they are bound variables, their names don't conflict. So perhaps using x for both is okay, but to avoid confusion, using different variables is better. However, in the formalization, variables are just placeholders, so it's acceptable to have different variables as long as they are properly quantified.\n\nAlternatively, the entire consequent is a material implication where the antecedent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) and the consequent is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). So the formula is correct as written.\n\nAnother thing to check is the order of the implication. Since the original statement says \"every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate,\" the correct translation is that if every monkey is asleep, then no donkeys ate. So the implication is in that direction.\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) )\n\nAlternatively, using universal quantifiers for both parts:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nEither form is acceptable. However, since the problem allows using standard logical symbols and the abbreviations, both forms are valid. However, perhaps the first form with the negated existential is preferable here because it's more direct.\n\nNow, let me check for any possible mistakes. For example, did I mix up the direction of the implication? Suppose \"only if\" is correctly translated. Let me take an example. If I say \"It is raining only if the ground is wet,\" that would be \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" Similarly, \"Every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate\" would be \"If every monkey is asleep, then no donkeys ate.\" So yes, the direction is correct.\n\nAnother point: the main conditional is \"If Lewis didn't chase Lewis...\" which is \u00acRbb. Then, the consequent is the implication between the two statements. So the structure is correct.\n\nNow, translating into formal logic:\n\nThe entire formula is:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested, so this is a valid well-formed formula. Alternatively, using the universal quantifier for the second part:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acIy) )\n\nEither way, variables x and y are bound, so it's okay. However, the problem might prefer using the same variable if possible, but since they are in different scopes, it's fine. However, to avoid confusion, using different variables is better.\n\nBut in the problem's example, they used x for both quantifiers. For example, in the example, \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So perhaps it's acceptable to reuse variables as long as they are in different scopes. Therefore, the formula can be written as:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) )\n\nBut here, the x in the second part is a different x (bound by \u2203x), so it's okay. Alternatively, to make it clearer, use a different variable, like z:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203z (Mz \u2227 Iz) )\n\nBut since variables are just placeholders, the choice of variable name doesn't matter. The problem's example uses x in both parts, so perhaps following that convention is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final formalization is:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) )\n\nAlternatively, if we want to use universal quantifiers for both, but that would require changing the second part to a universal. However, the problem allows any standard logical symbols, so both are acceptable.\n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence's consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if no donkeys ate.\" As discussed, this is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Therefore, the entire formula is as above.\n\nThus, the correct formalization should be:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) )\n\nWhich is a well-formed formula in predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRbb\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Jx)\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Ix))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The main structure is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the wording here is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again. The sentence is structured as \"If not all humans are asleep, then (Hazel kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel).\" So the main conditional is \"If [not all humans are asleep], then [Hazel kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel].\"\n\nLet me handle each part separately. Starting with the antecedent: \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So \"not all humans are asleep\" is the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) by moving the negation inside, but I think for the formalization, keeping it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) is acceptable unless there's a reason to convert it. But maybe the problem expects the direct negation. Let me note both possibilities but proceed with the original form unless instructed otherwise. The problem says to use the given abbreviations, so I need to make sure I'm using N for \"is a human\" and J for \"is asleep\".\n\nNext, the consequent is \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" in logic typically sets up a conditional where the \"only if\" part is the necessary condition. So \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel\" would be Q(c, a) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x, c)). Let me check that. If Hazel kicked Alfred (Qca) only if every human saw Hazel (which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Px c)), then yes, the kicking is conditional on the seeing. So Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx), then [Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)]. So the formal structure is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc)).\n\nWait, but sometimes in logic, implications can be nested, and sometimes it's better to simplify. Let me check if there's a way to write this more concisely or if there are any equivalences I should consider. However, the problem just asks for a correct formalization using the given abbreviations, so as long as the structure is correct, it's fine.\n\nLet me double-check each part. The antecedent is \"not all humans are asleep\" which is correctly \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx). The consequent is a conditional where the antecedent is Qca (Hazel kicked Alfred) and the consequent is \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc) (every human saw Hazel). So the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc)).\n\nAlternatively, could the consequent be written as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 Qca? No, because \"only if\" is the other way. For example, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the sentence was \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel,\" then it's Qca \u2192 \u2200x(...). So my initial translation is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any quantifier scopes that need to be considered? The consequent's implication is that if the antecedent (not all humans asleep) holds, then whenever Hazel kicks Alfred, it must be the case that every human saw her. So the structure seems right.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the abbreviations correctly. N is for human, J for asleep, Q for kicked, P for saw, c for Hazel, a for Alfred. Yes, that's all correct. The variables are properly used, and the quantifiers are in the right places. There's no need to change variable names or anything else. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(Qca\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is \"No humans ate if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations: N for being a human, I for ate, P for saw, and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is an \"if and only if\" statement. So the left side is \"No humans ate\" and the right side is \"not all humans saw Hazel.\" \n\nStarting with the left side: \"No humans ate.\" In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" is typically translated as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx). So here, \"No humans ate\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx). That makes sense because for all x, if x is a human, then x did not eat.\n\nNow the right side: \"Not all humans saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"all humans saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Px c), since P is [1] saw [2], and Hazel is c. So \"not all humans saw Hazel\" is the negation of that, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, this can be written using the existential quantifier by moving the negation inside: \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acPxc). But I need to check which form is appropriate here. The original statement uses \"not all,\" which directly negates the universal quantifier, so \u00ac\u2200x(...) is correct. However, sometimes it's preferable to use the existential form for clarity, but since the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax, either might be acceptable. However, the original instruction says to use the abbreviations provided, so maybe we should stick with the negated universal.\n\nSo the entire biconditional would be: \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc). \n\nWait, but let me confirm. The original sentence is \"No humans ate if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.\" So the left side is \"No humans ate\" (which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx)), and the right is \"not all humans saw Hazel\" (\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)). So combining them with \u2194 gives the correct formalization.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another way? Let's think. The right side \"not all humans saw Hazel\" is equivalent to \"there exists a human who did not see Hazel,\" which is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acPxc). So maybe the right side can be written as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acPxc). But the problem says to use the abbreviations provided, and both forms are logically equivalent. However, the original instruction says to return a single well-formed formula. Which form is more appropriate here? The original sentence uses \"not all,\" which directly translates to the negation of the universal quantifier. So \u00ac\u2200x(...) is more direct. However, sometimes in logic, it's more standard to use the existential form. But since the example given uses \u2200 and \u2192 for \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" perhaps following the same structure here is better. So I think using \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc) is acceptable here.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc). \n\nLet me double-check the biconditional direction. The sentence says \"No humans ate if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.\" So the left side is the antecedent of the biconditional. So the structure is (Left) \u2194 (Right). Yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother thing to check: the use of variables. In the left side, we have \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx). The x here is bound by the universal quantifier. On the right side, the same variable x is used in \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc), but since it's within the scope of another negation and another quantifier, it's okay. Each quantifier has its own scope, so the x in the right side is a separate binding. \n\nIs there any possibility of variable capture here? Probably not, since both are using x, but since they are both universally quantified (the right side is \u00ac\u2200x...), but in the biconditional, they are separate. So the formula is well-formed.\n\nSo putting it all together: \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc). That should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acIx)\u2194\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc)",

The sentence to formalize is: \"Not all monkeys ate just in case every human is asleep.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"is a monkey,\" I for \"ate,\" N for \"is a human,\" and J for \"is asleep.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence correctly. The phrase \"Not all monkeys ate\" translates to \"It is not the case that all monkeys ate.\" In predicate logic, \"All monkeys ate\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). So \"Not all monkeys ate\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx). But I need to see how the rest of the sentence connects.\n\nThe next part is \"just in case every human is asleep.\" The phrase \"just in case\" usually indicates a biconditional or a conditional. In logic, \"A just in case B\" is often translated as A \u2194 B. So the entire sentence is saying that the negation of all monkeys eating is equivalent to every human being asleep.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The structure is \"Not all monkeys ate just in case every human is asleep.\" So the main connective here is the biconditional between the two statements: \"Not all monkeys ate\" and \"Every human is asleep.\" So the formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Jy). \n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Alternatively, \"just in case\" might be used to mean that the condition (every human asleep) is necessary for the first part. But in standard usage, \"A just in case B\" is typically A \u2194 B. For example, \"I will go just in case it rains\" would mean I go if and only if it rains. So I think the biconditional is correct here.\n\nSo putting it all together: The entire formula should be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Jy). \n\nI need to make sure that variables are properly quantified. The left side uses x, and the right uses y, which is fine because they are separate quantifiers. Alternatively, you could use the same variable, but since they're in different quantifiers, it's okay. Also, the abbreviations are correctly applied: O for monkey, I for ate, N for human, J for asleep. \n\nAnother thing to check: \"Not all monkeys ate\" is indeed \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx). But since the problem says to use the given abbreviations and not necessarily to simplify, I should stick with the negation of the universal quantifier. \n\nTherefore, the final formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Jy).\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix)\u2194\u2200y(Ny\u2192Jy)",

It's saying that there doesn't exist any human who kicked Lewis. Alternatively, it could be phrased as \"For all humans, they did not kick Lewis.\"\n\nSo in predicate logic, when we say \"No A are B,\" it's usually translated as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx). But here, it's more like \"No A did Q to b.\" So maybe \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxb). But wait, the original sentence is about humans kicking Lewis. So Nx is \"x is a human\", and Qxb is \"x kicked Lewis (b)\". So the statement would be that for every x, if x is a human, then x did not kick b. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about \"no humans\" is that there does not exist an x such that Nx and Qxb. So that would be \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Qxb). Which is equivalent to the universal statement \u2200x\u00ac(Nx \u2227 Qxb), which by contraposition is equivalent to \u2200x(\u00acNx \u2228 \u00acQxb), which is the same as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxb). So both forms are possible. But which one is more standard?\n\nThe example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier with an implication. For instance, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" became \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So following that pattern, the translation here should probably use the universal quantifier as well. So \"No humans kicked Lewis\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxb). \n\nLet me check. The original sentence is a universal negative. In predicate logic, it's typically expressed as a universal statement. So yes, \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxb). \n\nAlternatively, using the negation of an existential might also be correct. But the example uses the universal approach. The example's sentence is \"Every linguist...\", which is a universal affirmative, translated with \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). The current sentence is a universal negative, so following the same structure, it's \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxb). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxb). Let me make sure that all the abbreviations are used correctly. N is for \"is a human\", Q is for \"[1] kicked [2]\", and b is Lewis. So Qxb means x kicked b (Lewis). Yes. Then the implication is if Nx (x is human) then not Qxb. So that's correct. \n\nI don't think there's any other way to interpret it. So the answer should be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acQxb).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acQxb)",

The sentence to formalize is \"Only humans are hungry and Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\" The abbreviations provided are N for \"is a human,\" L for \"is hungry,\" R for \"chased,\" c for Hazel, and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into two parts: \"Only humans are hungry\" and \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\" Let's start with the first part. \n\n\"Only humans are hungry\" means that if something is hungry, then it must be a human. In logical terms, this is a universal statement. So for all x, if Lx (x is hungry), then Nx (x is a human). So that would be \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Nx). \n\nNow the second part is straightforward: Hazel (c) didn't chase Alfred (a). Using the abbreviation R for \"chased,\" this would be \u00acRca. \n\nNow, we need to combine these two statements with a conjunction (\"and\"). So the entire formula should be the conjunction of \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Nx) and \u00acRca. \n\nLet me check if there are any other elements or possible misinterpretations. The original sentence says \"Only humans are hungry,\" which is correctly captured as \"all hungry things are humans.\" There's no existential claim here, so a universal quantifier is correct. \n\nHazel not chasing Alfred is a simple negation of the predicate R with c and a. \n\nPutting it all together: \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Nx) \u2227 \u00acRca. \n\nI need to ensure that the syntax is correct.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is: \"If Alfred will run, then no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. The main conditional is \"If Alfred will run, then [complex statement].\" The complex statement is \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" Let's break that down.\n\nThe phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the \"no humans are hungry\" is the A part, and \"every human saw Hazel\" is the B part. So the complex statement would be: If there are no hungry humans, then every human saw Hazel. Wait, but actually, \"only if\" reverses the direction. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" means that A can only happen if B is true, so A \u2192 B. So in this case, \"no humans are hungry\" (let's call that \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) only if every human saw Hazel (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x, c))). So the complex part is \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x, c)).\n\nNow, the entire sentence is \"If Alfred will run (F(a)), then [that implication].\" So putting it all together: F(a) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x, c))].\n\nBut wait, implications can be nested. Let me check if I can simplify that. The structure is F(a) \u2192 (A \u2192 B), where A is \"no humans are hungry\" and B is \"every human saw Hazel\". Alternatively, using material implication, A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. But perhaps it's clearer to keep it as an implication.\n\nLet me verify the abbreviations:\n\n- F: [1] will run \u2192 F(a) for Alfred will run.\n- N: [1] is a human.\n- L: [1] is hungry.\n- P: [1] saw [2], so P(x, c) where c is Hazel.\n\nSo \"no humans are hungry\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx). Because there does not exist an x such that x is a human and x is hungry.\n\nThen \"every human saw Hazel\" is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x, c)).\n\nSo the implication is \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x, c)).\n\nPutting it all under the main conditional with F(a):\n\nF(a) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x, c))]\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can write this as:\n\nF(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x, c)))\n\nAlternatively, we can use the equivalence that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to use standard syntax, so probably keeping it as nested implications is okay.\n\nAnother way to write \u00ac\u2203x(...) is \u2200x\u00ac(...), so \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) is equivalent to \u2200x\u00ac(Nx \u2227 Lx), which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Maybe that's a more standard way to express \"no humans are hungry\" as \"for all x, if x is a human, then x is not hungry.\" Let me check: \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2194 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Yes, by De Morgan's law for quantifiers.\n\nSo maybe rewriting that part could make the formula look cleaner. Let me consider that. So the implication becomes \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x, c)). Then the entire formula is F(a) \u2192 [\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x, c))].\n\nBut does that affect the correctness? No, it's just an equivalent form. However, the original instruction says to use the abbreviations given. Since the user didn't specify which form to use (\u00ac\u2203 or \u2200\u00ac), either is acceptable. But perhaps the original phrasing \"no humans are hungry\" is more directly translated as \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx), so I'll stick with that.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\nF(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x, c)))\n\nNow, checking for proper syntax. Quantifiers and connectives are in the right places. Variables are properly bound. The formula is well-formed. I think this is correct.\n</think>\n\nFa\u2192(\u00ac\u2203x(Nx\u2227Lx)\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192Pxc))",

The abbreviations are M for \"is a donkey,\" O for \"is a monkey,\" and P for \"[1] saw [2].\" \n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence: \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\" So, for every donkey, there exists a monkey that the donkey saw. \n\nIn predicate logic, \"Every X Y\" usually translates to a universal quantifier for X, followed by an existential quantifier for Y. So here, it would be something like \"For all x, if x is a donkey, then there exists a y such that y is a monkey and x saw y.\"\n\nUsing the abbreviations, Mx would be \"x is a donkey,\" Oy would be \"y is a monkey,\" and Pxy would be \"x saw y.\" \n\nSo the structure would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy)). Let me check if that makes sense. The universal quantifier covers all x, and for each x that is a donkey, there must be at least one y that is a monkey and is seen by x. That seems correct. \n\nWait, could there be any other interpretations? Like, does \"a monkey\" imply that each donkey saw the same monkey or different ones?

No need for parentheses where they're not necessary, but I think the structure is clear. \n\nAnother way to think: if I missed any part?

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem. First, I need to parse the sentence carefully: \"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are M for donkey, Q for kicked, a for Alfred, F for will run, and c for Hazel.\n\nBreaking down the sentence into parts. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" and B is \"not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). But I remember that \u00ac\u2200x(Px) is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00acPx). So this becomes \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). Wait, because the negation of (Mx \u2192 Qxa) is Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa. So A is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa).\n\nNow for B: \"Not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" Let's parse this. The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, the statement is about \"not all donkeys will run\" being the P, and \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" being Q. So the structure is: (Not all donkeys will run) \u2192 (\u00acQac). \n\nFirst, \"not all donkeys will run\" is similar to the earlier part. \"All donkeys will run\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx), so the negation is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). Therefore, B is (\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx)) \u2192 \u00acQac.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire conditional is A \u2192 B, which is:\n\n[\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa)] \u2192 [\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2192 \u00acQac]\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. Let me check the structure again. The main conditional is If A then B, where B is itself a conditional. So the entire formula is A \u2192 (B1 \u2192 B2). But in standard logic, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. However, here the user wants the direct translation. So the original sentence is structured as \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). \n\nSo B is \"not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel\", which is B1 \u2192 B2 where B1 is \"not all donkeys will run\" and B2 is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\". Therefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2192 [ (\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx)) \u2192 \u00acQac ]\n\nBut in predicate logic, I need to make sure that the variables are properly quantified. Also, note that in B1, the existential quantifier uses x again. However, since the outermost scope is an implication, the x in B1 is a separate quantifier. But variables in different quantifiers can reuse the same variable name as long as they are in different scopes. However, to avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to use different variables. Wait, but in the original problem, the user hasn't specified to use specific variable names, just to use the abbreviations. So as long as the formula is well-formed, it's okay. However, in standard practice, if you have two quantifiers, they can use the same variable if they are nested, but here the \u2203x in B1 is inside an implication. Let me think.\n\nThe antecedent of the inner implication is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). The variable x here is bound by the existential quantifier. The consequent is \u00acQac, which doesn't involve x. So the entire inner implication is (\u2203x(...)) \u2192 ... So the x in the inner \u2203x is local to that part. Therefore, the formula is acceptable as written. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2192 ( \u2203y(My \u2227 \u00acFy) \u2192 \u00acQac )\n\nWait, but if I use the same variable x in both existentials, is that allowed? Well, in formal logic, when you have nested quantifiers or separate quantifiers in different parts of the formula, you can have the same variable as long as they are in different scopes. However, to avoid confusion, it's better to use different variables. For example, in the antecedent, we have \u2203x(...), and in the consequent's antecedent, \u2203x(...). But since they are in different scopes, they are separate variables. However, in practice, some people prefer to use different variables for clarity. Since the problem doesn't specify variable names, I can choose different variables. Let me adjust the inner one to use y instead of x to avoid confusion.\n\nSo the formula becomes:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2192 ( \u2203y(My \u2227 \u00acFy) \u2192 \u00acQac )\n\nBut since the problem allows any variables as long as the formula is correct, using x twice is technically okay. However, to make it clearer, perhaps using different variables is better. However, in the example given, they used x in the universal quantifier. So maybe it's acceptable. Let me check the example again. In the example, the formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they use x as the bound variable. So perhaps in the answer, using x in both existentials is acceptable. But since they are in different scopes, they are separate variables. So the formula is correct as:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2192 ( \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2192 \u00acQac )\n\nBut when writing this, the x in the inner \u2203x is a different occurrence. However, in formal logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers, so even if the same variable name is used, they are treated as separate. Therefore, the formula is correct. However, some systems prefer to have unique variables. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n(\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2192 (\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2192 \u00acQac))\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, using different variables for the existentials. For example, the first \u2203x and the second \u2203y. Let me check the original sentence again. The first part is about donkeys not kicking Alfred, the second part about donkeys not running. So the variables in each existential are about donkeys. So using the same variable is okay. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2192 ( \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2192 \u00acQac )\n\nBut in standard notation, parentheses are important. So the entire formula is:\n\n[ \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) ] \u2192 [ \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2192 \u00acQac ]\n\nWhich is a well-formed formula. So that's the translation.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2192 (\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2192 \u00acQac)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The abbreviations given are O for monkey, P for saw, b for Lewis, M for donkey, Q for kicked, c for Hazel, and a for Alfred. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then...\" So the antecedent is \"every monkey saw Lewis,\" which translates to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. But here, the main part is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" Let's break that down.\n\nThe \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" part would be the negation of \"all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" \"All donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc). So the negation is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc), which is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc). \n\nBut then this is modified by \"only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" So the whole consequent is: (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc)) only if (Pa a). Using the \"A only if B\" structure, that would translate to (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc)) \u2192 Pa a. \n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is: If [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)], then [ (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc)) \u2192 Pa a ].\n\nSo combining these parts with the conditional, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 Pa a)\n\nBut I need to check if the scope is correct. The original sentence is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's how I've structured it. \n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the quantifiers are properly scoped. The antecedent uses a universal quantifier for monkeys, and the consequent's B part uses a universal (but negated) for donkeys. The \"only if\" part is about Alfred seeing himself, which is Pa a since Alfred is a constant a, and saw is P, so P with the same term for both arguments.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write the final formula again to make sure:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 Paa)\n\nWait, in the abbreviations, P is [1] saw [2], so Alfred saw Alfred would be Paa, yes. So the final formula is as above. I don't see any errors here. The structure is correct, using the given abbreviations and logical symbols.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc)\u2192Paa)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"A monkey kicked Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis drank.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The first part is \"A monkey kicked Alfred.\" The word \"a\" here suggests an existential quantifier because it's about the existence of at least one monkey. The abbreviation O is for \"[1] is a monkey\", so we'll need \u2203x (Ox ... ). Then \"kicked Alfred\" uses Q, which is \"[1] kicked [2]\". So the first part would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxa), since Alfred is represented by 'a'.\n\nThe second part is \"it is not the case that Lewis drank.\" Lewis is 'b', and H is \"[1] drank\". So the negation would be \u00acHb. \n\nNow, combining the two parts with \"but\", which in logic is just a conjunction, so \u2227. So the whole formula should be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxa) \u2227 \u00acHb. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the quantifier only applies to the first part. Since the second part is separate, the structure is (existential statement) and (negation), so the \u2227 is at the top level. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again. The monkey part is an existential, then the Lewis part is a negation. So yes, the entire formula is the conjunction of those two. No need for parentheses around the negation since it's just a single term. \n\nSo the final formula should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxa) \u2227 \u00acHb. Using the abbreviations correctly. Let me confirm the symbols: O, Q, a, H, b are all from the given abbreviations. Quantifiers are \u2203 and \u2200 as needed. Connectives are \u2227 and \u00ac.

The sentence is: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are O for being a monkey, P for saw, b for Lewis, L for hungry, and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"every monkey saw Lewis\" and B is \"Lewis is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" In predicate logic, this would be a universal quantifier over all monkeys. So \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, b)). Because every x that is a monkey (Ox) must have saw Lewis (b), which is P(x, b).\n\nNow B: \"Lewis is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is that if Lewis is hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel. So Lb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, c)). \n\nPutting the whole conditional together: If A then B becomes A \u2192 B.

The variables in the antecedent and consequent are both using x, but since they are bound within their own quantifiers, it should be okay. Also, since the consequent is a conditional where the antecedent is Lb and the consequent is another universal statement. \n\nLet me double-check the \"only if\" part. The original sentence says \"Lewis is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" So Lb only if \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x,c)). So yes, that translates to Lb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x,c)). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication is correct.

The main connective is the implication between the two big parts. The antecedent is the universal about monkeys seeing Lewis, and the consequent is the implication about Lewis's hunger and the universal about monkeys seeing Hazel.

The sentence to formalize is \"A monkey kicked Lewis or only donkeys drank.\" The abbreviations provided are O for monkey, Q for kicked, b for Lewis, M for donkey, and H for drank.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence into two parts connected by \"or\". The first part is \"A monkey kicked Lewis,\" and the second part is \"only donkeys drank.\" Let's handle each part separately.\n\nStarting with \"A monkey kicked Lewis.\" This seems to be an existential statement. There exists some x such that x is a monkey (Ox) and x kicked Lewis (Qxb). So the first part would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxb).\n\nNow the second part: \"only donkeys drank.\" The word \"only\" here is a bit tricky. When we say \"only donkeys drank,\" it means that if something drank, then it must be a donkey. So in logical terms, for all x, if Hx (x drank), then Mx (x is a donkey). So that would be \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx).\n\nPutting the two parts together with the disjunction \"or,\" the entire formula should be the disjunction of the two parts. So combining them: \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxb) \u2228 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Mx).\n\nWait, let me double-check. The original sentence is \"A monkey kicked Lewis or only donkeys drank.\" The \"or\" here is at the sentence level, so it's a logical OR between the two statements. So yes, the formalization would be the existential for the first part OR the universal for the second part. That seems correct.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the abbreviations correctly. O is for monkey, Q is kicked with two arguments, so Qxb where x is the kicker and b is Lewis. M is donkey, H is drank. The \"only donkeys drank\" translates to all drinkers are donkeys, which is the implication Hx \u2192 Mx. So the universal quantifier over that implication.\n\nNo other abbreviations are given, so I shouldn't introduce any other symbols.

Quantifiers are correctly placed, connectives are appropriate. The existential is for the monkey kicking Lewis, and the universal for the donkey drinkers. The \"or\" is between the two. Looks good.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviations provided are M for \"[1] is a donkey,\" b for Lewis, and Q for \"[1] kicked [2].\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using those symbols.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the sentence. The structure is \"A unless B.\" In logic, \"A unless B\" is typically translated as \"A \u2228 B,\" but I need to be careful here. Let me recall that \"A unless B\" can also be interpreted as \"If not B, then A,\" or \"If B, then A.\" Wait, maybe I should think about the exact meaning. The original sentence says that Lewis is a donkey unless it's not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis. So, if it's not true that all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey. Alternatively, Lewis is a donkey or all donkeys kicked Lewis. Hmm, maybe that's the right approach.\n\nLet me break it down. The phrase \"unless\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A unless B\" is often formalized as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\" or equivalently \"A \u2228 B.\" Let me check both possibilities here.\n\nThe original sentence: \"Lewis is a donkey (M(b)) unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b)).\" So, putting it together, the \"unless\" would mean that if it's not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey. So that would be \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b)) \u2192 M(b). Alternatively, using the \"A \u2228 B\" structure, it would be M(b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). Wait, but which one is correct?\n\nLet me think about the equivalence. \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" So both forms are possible. However, depending on the context, sometimes one is more appropriate. Let's see. The original sentence is stating that Lewis being a donkey holds unless the condition \"all donkeys kicked Lewis\" does not hold. So if the condition fails (i.e., not all donkeys kicked Lewis), then Lewis is a donkey. That seems like \u00acB \u2192 A where B is \"all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So B is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). Therefore, \u00acB is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). So the implication would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). Alternatively, the disjunction would be M(b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(...). Both are equivalent because A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B, but here the \"unless\" is A unless B which is \u00acB \u2192 A. So perhaps the correct form here is \u00acB \u2192 A.\n\nBut let's check. Let me consider the example. Suppose \"It will rain unless it is cloudy.\" That would mean if it's not cloudy, then it will rain. So \u00acB \u2192 A where B is \"it is cloudy\" and A is \"it will rain.\" So yes, that's the structure. So in our case, \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Wait, the phrasing is a bit confusing. Let me rephrase the original sentence: \"Lewis is a donkey unless [it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis].\" So the \"unless\" is connecting two propositions: A = Lewis is a donkey; B = it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis. Wait, but \"unless\" is usually \"A unless B\" meaning \"if not B, then A.\" Wait, no, maybe I have to be careful. Let me recall the standard translation. The standard is that \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" So if the original sentence is \"A unless B,\" then both forms hold. So in this case, A is \"Lewis is a donkey,\" and B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So the sentence is A unless B, which would be A \u2228 B, or equivalently \u00acB \u2192 A. Let me check both.\n\nSo B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). So A \u2228 B would be M(b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). Alternatively, \u00acB \u2192 A would be \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(...)) \u2192 A, which simplifies to \u2200x(...) \u2192 M(b). So which is the correct way to formalize it?\n\nThe problem is that sometimes \"unless\" can be ambiguous, but in formal logic, we need to pick one. Let me think about the meaning. The sentence says that Lewis is a donkey, except in the case where all donkeys did kick him. Wait, no. The \"unless\" is saying that Lewis is a donkey unless the condition \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" holds. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse the original sentence again: \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So the structure is: A unless C, where A is \"Lewis is a donkey,\" and C is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So the meaning is: If C is true, then A is true? Or if C is false, then A is true? Let me think. The phrase \"A unless B\" usually means that A is true except when B is true. Wait, no. Wait, the standard is that \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B,\" which would mean that at least one of A or B is true. So if B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" then the sentence says that either Lewis is a donkey, or not all donkeys kicked Lewis. But that might not capture the intended meaning. Let me think again. Suppose that all donkeys did kick Lewis. Then according to the disjunction, since B is \"not all...\" which would be false, then A must be true for the disjunction to hold. So if all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis must be a donkey. Alternatively, if not all donkeys kicked Lewis, then the disjunction is true regardless of A. But the original sentence says that Lewis is a donkey unless [the condition], which might imply that if the condition holds (i.e., not all kicked), then Lewis is a donkey. But according to the disjunction, if the condition holds (B is true), then A can be false. Wait, no. If B is true, then A \u2228 B is true regardless of A. So the disjunction would allow for cases where B is true and A is false. But the original sentence says that Lewis is a donkey unless B. So if B is true, then Lewis is a donkey. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think of an example. Suppose the sentence is \"You pass the exam unless you don't study.\" So \"pass unless not study.\" That would mean if you don't study, then you don't pass. Wait, no. Wait, \"pass unless not study\" would mean that you pass unless the case that you don't study. So if you don't study, then you don't pass. Which is equivalent to: if you study, then you pass. So \"pass unless not study\" is equivalent to \"if you study, then you pass.\" Which is the same as \"\u00ac(not study) \u2192 pass,\" i.e., \"study \u2192 pass.\" Alternatively, \"pass \u2228 \u00acstudy.\" So in that case, the original sentence \"A unless B\" where A is \"pass\" and B is \"not study\" becomes \"A \u2228 B\" which is \"pass \u2228 \u00acstudy,\" equivalent to \"study \u2192 pass.\" \n\nApplying that to our problem. The original sentence is \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Let me denote A as \"Lewis is a donkey\" (M(b)), and B as \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b)). So the sentence is \"A unless B.\" According to the example above, that would translate to \"A \u2228 B,\" which is M(b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \"if not B, then A,\" which would be \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(...)) \u2192 M(b), which simplifies to \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nNow, what does this mean? The implication says that if all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey. Which seems to be the intended meaning. Because the original sentence is saying that Lewis is a donkey unless (i.e., except when) not all donkeys kicked him. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me rephrase the original sentence: \"Lewis is a donkey unless it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So the \"unless\" is saying that Lewis is a donkey except in the case where not all donkeys kicked him. Wait, that's a bit counterintuitive. Let me think again. If \"unless\" is like \"except when,\" then \"A unless B\" is \"A except when B.\" So if B is true, then A is not necessarily true. But if B is false, then A must be true. So in our case, if B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" then \"A unless B\" would mean that if B is false (i.e., all donkeys did kick Lewis), then A (Lewis is a donkey) must be true. Otherwise, if B is true (not all kicked), then A could be either true or false. But the original sentence says \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So perhaps the intended meaning is that Lewis is a donkey if it is not the case that all donkeys kicked him. Wait, that would be different. Let me parse the sentence again. Maybe I got the direction of the implication wrong. \n\nThe original sentence: \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" The structure is A unless C. If I interpret it as \"If C, then A,\" then C is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" so the implication would be \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 M(b). Alternatively, if it's \"A unless C\" meaning \"A if not C,\" then it would be \u00acC \u2192 A. Which is \u2200x(...) \u2192 M(b). \n\nLet me try to think of a real-world example. Suppose there's a rule: \"You get a prize unless you didn't win.\" So getting a prize unless you didn't win. That would mean that if you did win (i.e., not didn't win), then you get a prize. So \"prize unless \u00acwin\" translates to \"if win, then prize.\" So in that case, \"A unless B\" is \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" \n\nApplying that to our problem: \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So A is \"Lewis is a donkey,\" B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So \"A unless B\" would be \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" Which is \"if not B, then A.\" Not B is \"it is not the case that not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is equivalent to \"all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Therefore, the implication is: if all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey. Which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nBut the original sentence is phrased as \"Lewis is a donkey unless [condition].\" So the [condition] is when the exception happens. So if the condition holds, then the exception applies. Wait, maybe I have it backwards. Let me think again. In the example \"You get a prize unless you didn't win,\" the exception is \"you didn't win.\" So if the exception holds (you didn't win), then you don't get the prize. But the original sentence says \"you get a prize unless [exception].\" So \"you get a prize unless [exception]\" is equivalent to \"if [exception] does not hold, then you get the prize.\" Which is the same as \"if you did win, then you get a prize.\" \n\nSo applying this to our problem: \"Lewis is a donkey unless [not all donkeys kicked Lewis].\" So the exception is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So if the exception does not hold (i.e., all donkeys did kick Lewis), then Lewis is a donkey. Therefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nAlternatively, using the disjunction, it's M(b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). Which is equivalent to the implication. \n\nBut which one is the correct way to formalize it according to the problem's requirements? The problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are correct, but perhaps the implication is more direct given the \"unless\" structure. However, the example provided in the problem uses an implication for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). But that's a universal statement, not an unless. \n\nIn our case, since \"unless\" can be translated as either an implication or a disjunction, but which is preferred? Let me think about the example given. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which became \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So for implications, they use the arrow. For the \"unless\" case, perhaps using the implication is better. \n\nBut let's check. If I use the implication form, then the formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). Wait, no. Earlier analysis showed that \"A unless B\" is \u00acB \u2192 A. So in this case, B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" so \u00acB is \"all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Therefore, the implication is \u00acB \u2192 A, which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nSo the formula would be (\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b)) \u2192 M(b). \n\nAlternatively, the disjunction is M(b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(...). \n\nBut which one is the correct formalization? Let me think about the meaning. The original sentence is saying that Lewis is a donkey, except in the case where all donkeys kicked him. Wait, no. The original sentence is \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So if \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" is true, then Lewis is a donkey. Wait, that would mean that if there exists at least one donkey that didn't kick Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey. But if all donkeys did kick Lewis, then the sentence doesn't say anything about Lewis being a donkey. Wait, no. Let me parse the sentence again. The sentence is structured as \"A unless B,\" which means that A holds unless B holds. So if B holds, then A may or may not hold. But if B does not hold, then A must hold. \n\nSo in our case, if \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" (B) is true, then the sentence doesn't require A (Lewis is a donkey) to be true. But if B is false (i.e., all donkeys did kick Lewis), then A must be true. Therefore, the correct translation is that if all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey. Which is the implication: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be that implication. \n\nBut let me check with the disjunction. The disjunction is M(b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). This is equivalent to the implication because in classical logic, A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. Wait, no. Wait, A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. Let me recall: A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. So if we have M(b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(...), then it's equivalent to \u00acM(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(...), which is not the same as the implication we derived earlier. Wait, this suggests a mistake in my earlier analysis. \n\nWait, earlier I thought that \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A, but according to the equivalence between A \u2228 B and \u00acA \u2192 B, perhaps I had the direction wrong. Let me clarify. \n\nLet me recall that in logic:\n\n- \"A unless B\" is typically translated as \"A \u2228 B\", which is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\"? Wait, no. Let me check the logical equivalences. \n\nThe statement \"A \u2228 B\" is logically equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\"? No, that's not correct. \"A \u2228 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\"? Let me check with a truth table. Suppose A is true, B is false: A \u2228 B is true. \u00acA \u2192 B would be true \u2192 false, which is false. Wait, that can't be right. So clearly, \"A \u2228 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\"? No, that's not correct. Let me re-express:\n\n\"A \u2228 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\"? No. For example, \"A \u2228 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB \u2192 A\" only if both implications hold. But in reality, \"A \u2228 B\" is equivalent to both \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB \u2192 A\" only if both are true. Wait, no. Actually, \"A \u2228 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\" is not correct. Let me take an example. Let A be true and B be false. Then A \u2228 B is true. Now, \u00acA \u2192 B would be false \u2192 false, which is true. So in this case, \"A \u2228 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2192 B.\" Similarly, if A is false and B is true, then \"A \u2228 B\" is true, and \"\u00acB \u2192 A\" would be false \u2192 false, which is true. However, if both A and B are false, then \"A \u2228 B\" is false, and \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" would be true \u2192 false, which is false. So in general, \"A \u2228 B\" is equivalent to both \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" Wait, no, because if A is true and B is false, then \"\u00acB \u2192 A\" would be true \u2192 true, which is true. So in this case, both implications hold. Wait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. \n\nActually, \"A \u2228 B\" is logically equivalent to both \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" Let me confirm with logical equivalences. \n\nWe know that A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B (this is material implication). Similarly, A \u2228 B is also equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. Because A \u2228 B is the same as B \u2228 A, so applying the same logic, it's equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. Therefore, \"A \u2228 B\" is equivalent to both \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" Therefore, \"A unless B\" can be translated as \"A \u2228 B,\" which is equivalent to both implications. \n\nBut in our problem, the original sentence is \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So A is \"Lewis is a donkey\" (M(b)), and B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b)). Therefore, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" or \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" or \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" \n\nWait, but which one is the correct way to model the sentence? Let's consider the meaning again. The sentence is saying that Lewis is a donkey, except in the case where not all donkeys kicked him. Wait, no. The \"unless\" is saying that Lewis is a donkey unless the condition B holds. So if B holds, then Lewis is a donkey? Or if B does not hold, then Lewis is a donkey? \n\nIf we take \"A unless B\" as \"A \u2228 B,\" then it means that at least one of A or B is true. So either Lewis is a donkey, or not all donkeys kicked Lewis. But that might not capture the intended meaning. Let me think of a scenario. Suppose that all donkeys kicked Lewis. Then B is false (since B is \"not all...\"), so for A \u2228 B to be true, A must be true. Therefore, Lewis must be a donkey. So in this case, if all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey. That seems to be the intended meaning. If not all donkeys kicked Lewis, then B is true, so A \u2228 B is true regardless of A. So Lewis could be a donkey or not. \n\nBut the original sentence says \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So if not all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey. Wait, that would be different. If B is true (not all kicked), then A must be true. But in the disjunction A \u2228 B, if B is true, then A can be false. So that would contradict. Therefore, perhaps I have the direction wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the \"unless.\" Let me re-express the sentence: \"Lewis is a donkey unless [it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis].\" So the \"unless\" is saying that Lewis is a donkey if it is not the case that all donkeys kicked him. Wait, that would be different. Let me think of an example. If I say \"I will go to the party unless it rains,\" it means that if it rains, I won't go. But if it doesn't rain, I will go. So \"A unless B\" means \"A if not B,\" which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. \n\nSo in our case, \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" would mean that if not all donkeys kicked Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey. Which is B \u2192 A, where B is \"not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" and A is \"Lewis is a donkey.\" Therefore, the implication would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nBut earlier analysis suggested that \"A unless B\" is equivalent to A \u2228 B, which is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B and \u00acB \u2192 A. So there's a contradiction here. How to resolve this? \n\nLet me go back to the example. The example given in the problem is \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). That's straightforward. For the \"unless\" case, perhaps the correct translation is the implication. Let me check with the example of \"You will pass unless you don't study.\" If we take \"pass unless \u00acstudy,\" then it means that if you don't study, you won't pass. Which is \u00acstudy \u2192 \u00acpass, which is the contrapositive of pass \u2192 study. But according to the earlier logic, \"A unless B\" is A \u2228 B, which would be pass \u2228 \u00acstudy, which is equivalent to study \u2192 pass. So there's a discrepancy here. Wait, in this example, \"pass unless \u00acstudy\" would mean that if you don't study, you don't pass. But according to the A \u2228 B translation, it would mean pass \u2228 \u00acstudy, which is equivalent to study \u2192 pass. So if you study, you pass; if you don't study, it doesn't say anything about passing. But the intuitive meaning of \"pass unless \u00acstudy\" is that if you don't study, you won't pass. So there's a difference between the two. \n\nThis suggests that the translation of \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B may not always capture the intended meaning, depending on context. Perhaps in some cases, it's better to use the implication. \n\nLet me try to resolve this. The confusion arises from the different interpretations of \"unless.\" In logic, \"A unless B\" is typically translated as A \u2228 B, which allows for both A and B to be true, or either one. However, in natural language, sometimes \"unless\" is used to indicate that A is true if and only if B is not true. That is, A \u2194 \u00acB. But that's a biconditional. However, that's not always the case. \n\nIn our problem, the sentence is \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" If we interpret this as \"Lewis is a donkey if and only if it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" then the translation would be M(b) \u2194 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). But that's a biconditional, which is stronger than the standard \"unless.\" \n\nHowever, the original sentence doesn't specify a biconditional. It just says that Lewis is a donkey unless the condition holds. So it's more likely that the intended meaning is that if the condition holds (not all kicked), then Lewis is a donkey. And if the condition doesn't hold (all kicked), then Lewis may or may not be a donkey. But the original sentence doesn't specify that. \n\nBut in the example I thought of earlier, \"You will pass unless you don't study,\" the natural interpretation is that if you don't study, you won't pass. Which is \u00acstudy \u2192 \u00acpass, which is the contrapositive of pass \u2192 study. But according to the A \u2228 B translation, it would be pass \u2228 \u00acstudy, which is equivalent to study \u2192 pass. So there's a difference between the two. \n\nThis suggests that the translation depends on the intended meaning, and sometimes \"unless\" is used to indicate a necessary condition rather than a sufficient one. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I need to rely on the standard logical translation of \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B, which is what the example in the problem might suggest. However, in our case, if we take the disjunction, then the formula would be M(b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b). This would mean that either Lewis is a donkey, or not all donkeys kicked him. \n\nBut let's think about the meaning. If all donkeys kicked Lewis, then the second part of the disjunction is false, so the first part must be true. Hence, Lewis must be a donkey. If not all donkeys kicked him, then the second part is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of whether Lewis is a donkey or not. This seems to align with the intended meaning. Because the sentence says that Lewis is a donkey unless (i.e., except when) not all donkeys kicked him. Wait, no. If the condition is \"not all donkeys kicked him,\" then the disjunction says that either Lewis is a donkey or that condition holds. So if the condition holds (not all kicked), then the disjunction is true regardless of Lewis being a donkey. But the original sentence says that Lewis is a donkey unless that condition holds. So if the condition holds, then Lewis is a donkey. But the disjunction allows for the condition to hold and Lewis not being a donkey. This suggests a discrepancy. \n\nAh, here's the problem. The original sentence says that Lewis is a donkey unless the condition holds. So if the condition holds, then Lewis must be a donkey. But the disjunction allows for the condition to hold and Lewis not being a donkey. Therefore, the correct translation should enforce that if the condition holds, then Lewis is a donkey. Which would be the implication: \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 M(b). \n\nSo why is there a discrepancy between the standard translation and the intended meaning? Because the standard translation of \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B allows for B to be true and A to be false, but in some cases, the natural language usage of \"unless\" implies that B being true necessitates A being true. \n\nThis seems to be the case here. The sentence says that Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked him. This sounds like if not all donkeys kicked him, then he is a donkey. Hence, the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 M(b). \n\nTherefore, the correct formula is: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nBut let's check this with the example. If not all donkeys kicked Lewis (i.e., there exists some donkey that didn't kick him), then Lewis is a donkey. If all donkeys did kick him, then the antecedent is false, so the implication is true regardless of M(b). So Lewis could be a donkey or not. This seems to align with the sentence's meaning. \n\nAlternatively, if the sentence had said \"Lewis is a donkey if and only if not all donkeys kicked him,\" then it would be a biconditional. But the sentence uses \"unless,\" which typically implies a one-way condition. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is the implication: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nNow, translating this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. The antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b), and the consequent is M(b). So the formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b)\n\nBut I need to check if this is a well-formed formula. Yes, it uses the standard symbols and quantifiers. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes people prefer to push the negation inside using quantifier duality. \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP. So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00ac(Mx \u2192 Qx b)), which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQx b). So the formula could also be written as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nBut the problem says to use the standard logical symbols and quantifiers, so both forms are acceptable. However, the example provided uses \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), which keeps the quantifier in its original form. Therefore, it's better to keep the negation outside the universal quantifier unless required otherwise. \n\nThus, the final formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b). \n\nBut let me confirm once more. The sentence says \"Lewis is a donkey unless not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So if not all donkeys kicked Lewis (i.e., there exists at least one donkey that didn't kick him), then Lewis is a donkey. This is captured by the implication. \n\nYes, this seems correct. So the final answer is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx b) \u2192 M(b)\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\u2192Mb",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the sentence: \"If a human chased Hazel, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" The abbreviations provided are N for being a human, R for chasing, c for Hazel, Q for kicking, a for Alfred, O for being a monkey, and L for being hungry.\n\nThe main structure here is a conditional statement: If A, then B. Let's break down each part.\n\nThe antecedent is \"a human chased Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, this would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc). Wait, but the original sentence says \"a human chased Hazel,\" which implies there exists at least one human who chased Hazel. So that's an existential quantifier.\n\nThe consequent is a bit more complex: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" in logic usually translates to an implication where the \"only if\" part is the consequent. So \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. Here, P is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel,\" which is \u00acQac. Q is \"every monkey is hungry,\" which is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx).\n\nPutting that together, the consequent becomes \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). Wait, but the original says \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry,\" so that would be \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). But I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's structured as (\u00acQac) only if (every monkey is hungry), which would mean that \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx). Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo the entire sentence is: If there exists a human who chased Hazel, then [\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx)]. So combining the antecedent and the consequent, the whole formula would be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))? Wait, no. Wait, the antecedent is \"a human chased Hazel,\" which is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc), not \u2200x. Because \"a human\" implies existence, not all. So the antecedent is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). Then the consequent is \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx).\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx)). But in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, maybe we can rephrase the consequent. Since P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q, but perhaps it's better to keep it as an implication.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nBut I need to check if there's any variable conflict. The antecedent uses x, and the consequent also uses x in the universal quantifier. But since the scope of the existential is only the antecedent, and the consequent's universal quantifier is separate, it's okay. The x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent are different variables (though they use the same letter, but in different scopes). So that's acceptable in predicate logic.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, maybe the consequent's x could be a different variable, but since variables are bound by their quantifiers, it's technically correct as is. So the final formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Ly))\n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations given, and there's no restriction on variable names. However, the example uses x, so perhaps it's acceptable to use x again. Wait, in the example, the formula is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So variables can be reused as long as they're properly bound.\n\nSo the correct formalization would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nBut maybe the variables in the consequent should be a different letter to avoid confusion, but logically, it's the same. Since the x in the antecedent is bound by the existential, and the x in the consequent's universal quantifier is a separate binding. So the formula is valid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the consequent's implication to be structured differently. Let me check again. The original sentence is: If A, then (B only if C). Which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Here, B is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel,\" which is \u00acQac, and C is \"every monkey is hungry,\" which is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). So yes, the consequent is \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). Therefore, the entire formula is as above.\n\nAnother thing to check: the use of \"only if\". The structure \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So if the sentence had been \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry,\" that's \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). So that's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the formalization is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))",

The sentence is \"Not all humans are hungry and Lewis saw Alfred.\" I need to break this down into two parts because of the conjunction \"and.\" \n\nFirst, the part \"Not all humans are hungry.\" The standard way to translate \"Not all\" in predicate logic is to use the negation of a universal quantifier. Normally, \"All humans are hungry\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Lx). So \"Not all\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Lx). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acLx), meaning there exists a human who is not hungry. But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and just translate directly. Since the original is \"Not all,\" I should probably stick with the negation of the universal statement unless instructed otherwise. Wait, but maybe the user expects the most straightforward form. Let me think. The example given used the universal quantifier for \"Every linguist,\" so for \"Not all humans,\" the direct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Lx). But sometimes, people prefer to convert it to an existential, but the problem says to use the given abbreviations and not add anything. Since the example used the universal, maybe I should use the negation of that here. So first part is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Lx).\n\nSecond part: \"Lewis saw Alfred.\" Using the abbreviations, P is \"[1] saw [2]\", so Pba since Lewis is 'b' and Alfred is 'a'. So Pba.\n\nNow combine the two parts with \u2227. So the whole formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Lx) \u2227 Pba.\n\nLet me check if that's correct.

The sentence is \"A monkey kicked Alfred and Lewis is a donkey.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"is a monkey,\" Q for \"kicked,\" a for Alfred, M for \"is a donkey,\" and b for Lewis. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"A monkey kicked Alfred.\" In predicate logic, when we say \"A monkey,\" that's an existential quantifier because it's referring to at least one monkey. So, there exists some x such that x is a monkey (Ox) and x kicked Alfred (Qxa). So that part would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxa).\n\nThen the second part is \"Lewis is a donkey.\" Since Lewis is a specific individual (b), this is straightforward: Mb. \n\nNow, the two parts are connected by \"and,\" which in logic is just a conjunction.

Since the \"and\" connects two separate statements, the structure is correct. The first part is an existential statement, and the second is a simple predicate about Lewis. \n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis is a donkey.\" The abbreviations provided are N for human, J for asleep, O for monkey, R for chased, c for Hazel, M for donkey, and b for Lewis.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"every human is asleep\" and B is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis is a donkey.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"every human is asleep.\" In predicate logic, this would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx). That's straightforward because for all x, if x is a human (N), then x is asleep (J).\n\nNow the tricky part is B: \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis is a donkey.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit confusing. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, for every monkey, if they chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey. So for each monkey, if they chased Hazel (Rxc), then M(b) (Lewis is a donkey). \n\nPutting that together: For all x, if O(x) (x is a monkey), then (R(x,c) \u2192 M(b)). Wait, but the original sentence says \"every monkey chased Hazel only if...\" So each monkey's chasing of Hazel is conditional on Lewis being a donkey. So the structure is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 Mb)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire conditional would be: If \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx), then \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 Mb)).\n\nIn formal terms, that would be written as:\n\n\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 Mb))\n\nI should check if I'm using the abbreviations correctly. The abbreviations are N for human, J for asleep, O for monkey, R for chased, c is Hazel, M is donkey, and b is Lewis. Yes, that matches. \n\nAnother thing to verify is the use of \"only if.\" Since \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition, the correct implication is that the antecedent is the action (monkey chased Hazel) and the consequent is the condition (Lewis is a donkey). So Rxc \u2192 Mb is correct here. \n\nAlso, since the entire statement is a conditional, the main connective is the implication between the two universal statements. There's no need for additional quantifiers or connectives beyond what's already there. \n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Rxc\u2192Mb))\n\nI think that's it. Let me double-check. The antecedent is \"every human is asleep,\" and the consequent is \"for every monkey, if they chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey.\" Yes, that aligns with the original sentence. The use of \u2200x for both the humans and the monkeys is correct. The only thing is that the second universal quantifier uses the same variable x, but since it's in a different scope, that's acceptable in predicate logic. Alternatively, using a different variable like y might be possible, but since the variable is bound within each quantifier, using x again is allowed. So the formula is well-formed.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Rxc\u2192Mb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"No monkeys saw every donkey.\" And the abbreviations are O for monkey, M for donkey, and P for saw.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. \"No monkeys saw every donkey.\" So, it's saying that there isn't a monkey who saw all the donkeys. In other words, for every monkey, there's at least one donkey that they didn't see. Or maybe it's saying that no single monkey has the property of seeing every donkey.\n\nLet me think about how to translate \"No A saw every B.\" The general structure here is \"No A satisfies the condition of having seen every B.\" In predicate logic, \"No A\" would be the negation of \"There exists an A...\" So maybe start with \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 ...). Then the ... part would be \"x saw every donkey.\" How do I express \"x saw every donkey\"? That would be \u2200y (My \u2192 Pxy). So putting that together, the entire formula would be \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (My \u2192 Pxy)).\n\nWait, let me check. If I have \"No monkeys saw every donkey,\" it's equivalent to saying \"For all monkeys, there exists at least one donkey that they didn't see.\" Which would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acPxy)). But are these two forms equivalent?\n\nYes, by the rules of quantifier negation. The negation of \u2203x (A \u2227 \u2200y (B \u2192 C)) would be \u2200x (\u00acA \u2228 \u00ac\u2200y (B \u2192 C)), which is \u2200x (\u00acA \u2228 \u2203y \u00ac(B \u2192 C)). Then since \u00ac(B \u2192 C) is equivalent to B \u2227 \u00acC, so it becomes \u2200x (\u00acA \u2228 \u2203y (B \u2227 \u00acC)). Which would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acPxy)). \n\nBut which form is more direct here? The original sentence is \"No monkeys saw every donkey.\" The first approach directly negates the existence of a monkey who saw every donkey. The second approach rephrases it as for every monkey, there's some donkey they didn't see. Both are correct, but which one is preferred? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided, and just return a single well-formed formula.\n\nThe first approach would be \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (My \u2192 Pxy)). Let me check if that's correct. Let's see: \"There does not exist a monkey x such that for every y, if y is a donkey then x saw y.\" That's exactly the original sentence. So that's a valid formalization.\n\nAlternatively, the second approach is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acPxy)). Both are logically equivalent, but which one is considered more standard? Well, sometimes it's preferable to push the negation inward, but the problem doesn't specify. Since the example given uses a universal quantifier with an implication, maybe either is acceptable. However, the example for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So perhaps the preferred style here is to use universal quantifiers where possible, but in this case, the original statement is a negative existential. \n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both forms are correct. However, the first form directly translates the \"No X did Y\" as the negation of an existential. So I think that's the way to go here. Let me confirm with another example. If the sentence was \"No one likes everyone,\" that would be \u00ac\u2203x (Person(x) \u2227 \u2200y (Person(y) \u2192 Likes(x,y))). Similarly here, \"No monkeys saw every donkey\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (My \u2192 Pxy)).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (My \u2192 Pxy)). Let me check the syntax. The abbreviations are O, M, P. So O is [1] is a monkey, so Ox. M is [1] is a donkey, so My. P is [1] saw [2], so Pxy. So the formula is \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2200y (My \u2192 Pxy)). That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2203x(Ox\u2227\u2200y(My\u2192Pxy))",

The sentence is a conditional: \"If A, then B.\" So the overall form will be A \u2192 B. \n\nA is \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Therefore, \"not all\" is the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) by moving the negation inside, but the original form is \u00ac\u2200x(...). However, since the problem asks for formalization using the given symbols, I need to stick with the negation of the universal quantifier here.\n\nNow B is \"a human chased Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, if a human chased Hazel (let's call that P), then Lewis is hungry (Q). \n\nBreaking down P: \"a human chased Hazel.\" So there exists some human x such that x chased Hazel. That would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). Wait, but the original says \"a human chased Hazel\"\u2014so it's an existential statement. So B is saying that if such a human exists, then Lewis is hungry. Therefore, B would be (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc)) \u2192 Lb. \n\nPutting it all together: The entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 Lb]. \n\nWait, but I should check if there's a way to structure the \"only if\" part more directly. Since \"only if\" introduces a necessary condition. So \"If there is a human who chased Hazel, then Lewis is hungry.\" So yes, that's the correct translation.\n\nLet me make sure about the scope. The main connective is the implication from the first part to the second. The first part is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx). The second part is the implication from the existence of a human chasing Hazel to Lewis being hungry.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 Lb)\n\nAlternatively, since implications can be nested, that's correct. However, sometimes in logic, implications can be rephrased using contrapositives or other equivalences, but I don't think that's necessary here. The problem asks for a direct translation using the given abbreviations, so this should be acceptable.\n\nI need to check if the parentheses are correctly placed. The antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(...), and the consequent is \u2203x(...) \u2192 Lb. So yes, the entire consequent is the implication.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The abbreviations provided are R for chasing, c for Hazel, O for being a monkey, J for being asleep, P for seeing, and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" and B is \"every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\" Using the abbreviation R, which is [1] chased [2], so Hazel chasing Hazel would be Rcc. Since it's negated, it becomes \u00acRcc.\n\nNow, B is a bit more complex: \"every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. But here, the structure is \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" So, for every monkey, if it's asleep, then Alfred saw Alfred. Wait, but \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is a specific instance. Let me think.\n\nThe statement is saying that for every monkey, being asleep is conditional on Alfred having seen himself. So, for all x, if O(x) (x is a monkey) and J(x) (x is asleep), then Paa (Alfred saw Alfred). Wait, no. Actually, \"only if\" would mean that if a monkey is asleep, then the condition (Alfred saw Alfred) must hold. So, for all x, (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Paa)). Alternatively, since \"only if\" is a material implication, we can structure it as \u2200x (Ox \u2227 Jx \u2192 Paa). But wait, the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" part. Let me rephrase: The original statement is \"every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" So, the entire statement \"every monkey is asleep\" is the antecedent of the \"only if\" with Paa. Wait, maybe I should parse it as: If every monkey is asleep, then Alfred saw Alfred. But that's not quite right. Because \"only if\" reverses the implication. For example, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if we have \"Every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred,\" that would mean that if every monkey is asleep, then Alfred saw Alfred. But that's not the same as \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" which might actually mean that for each monkey, being asleep requires that Alfred saw Alfred. So, for each monkey, if it is asleep, then Alfred saw Alfred. Because the \"only if\" is inside the quantifier.\n\nSo, the correct formalization would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa ). Because for every x, if x is a monkey and x is asleep, then Paa holds. Alternatively, since Ox is \"x is a monkey\" and Jx is \"x is asleep,\" the statement is that for all monkeys, if they are asleep, then Paa. So, \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Paa)). Which is equivalent to \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa ). Either way is acceptable, but since Ox is a condition, maybe the first form is better. However, since the original statement is \"every monkey is asleep only if...\", maybe we can think of it as \"For every monkey, if it is asleep, then Paa.\" So that would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa ). \n\nBut wait, another approach: The entire \"every monkey is asleep\" is the antecedent. So, if all monkeys are asleep, then Paa. That would be ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 Paa. But that's a different structure. Let me check the difference between these two interpretations.\n\nOriginal sentence: \"every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The \"only if\" here is modifying the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" statement. So, \"Only if Alfred saw Alfred, every monkey is asleep.\" Which translates to: If every monkey is asleep, then Alfred saw Alfred. Which would be ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 Paa. But this is different from the per-monkey approach. Which one is correct?\n\nIn English, \"only if\" can sometimes be ambiguous, but in logic, we need to be precise. Let's consider examples. Suppose that if every monkey is asleep, then Paa. That would mean that whenever all monkeys are asleep, Paa must hold. However, if there's even one monkey that's not asleep, the antecedent is false, making the implication true regardless of Paa. On the other hand, if we have for every monkey, if it's asleep then Paa, then each individual monkey's sleep implies Paa. But if there are two monkeys, both asleep, then both would imply Paa, which is redundant but okay. However, if one monkey is asleep and another isn't, then only the first implication applies. But the original statement says \"every monkey is asleep only if...\", which suggests that the entire condition of all monkeys being asleep depends on Paa. Therefore, the correct formalization would be that if all monkeys are asleep, then Paa. Hence, ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 Paa.\n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" So \"every monkey is asleep\" is the event that happens only if the condition (Alfred saw Alfred) is met. So \"only if\" here is like a global condition. So yes, the correct way is to have the entire universal statement as the antecedent. Therefore, the implication is ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 Paa.\n\nBut now, combining this with the initial conditional: If \u00acRcc (Hazel didn't chase Hazel), then [that implication]. So the entire formula would be \u00acRcc \u2192 [ ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 Paa ].\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. However, another way to write A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So maybe we can restructure it. Let me check:\n\nOriginal implication: \u00acRcc \u2192 ( ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 Paa )\n\nThis can be rewritten as (\u00acRcc \u2227 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 Paa.\n\nBut the problem is whether the original sentence requires that structure. The original is a conditional where the consequent is itself a conditional. However, the user's example uses a similar structure. For instance, in the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they directly translate the universal statement.\n\nBut let's go back. Let me check again the original sentence: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred.\"\n\nThe consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" As discussed, this can be either:\n\nOption 1: ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) ) \u2192 Paa\n\nOption 2: \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa )\n\nWhich is correct? Let's think of \"only if\" in this context. For example, \"You can have dessert only if you finish your dinner.\" This translates to D \u2192 F, where D is \"you can have dessert\" and F is \"you finish dinner.\" Similarly, \"Every monkey is asleep only if Paa\" would mean that if every monkey is asleep (let's call that M), then Paa. So M \u2192 Paa. Therefore, Option 1.\n\nBut another perspective: \"Every monkey is asleep only if Paa\" could be interpreted as for each monkey, being asleep requires that Paa. So, for each monkey x, if x is asleep, then Paa. Which would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa ). Because if x is a monkey and asleep, then Paa must hold. This would mean that for every individual monkey's sleep, Paa is a condition. However, if there are multiple monkeys, each of their being asleep would require Paa. So if even one monkey is asleep, then Paa must be true. Whereas Option 1 says that if all monkeys are asleep, then Paa. These are different.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct? In natural language, \"only if\" can sometimes be ambiguous. But in logical formalization, we need to choose based on the structure. Let's take an example. Suppose there are two monkeys: Alice and Bob. \n\nCase 1: If \"every monkey is asleep only if Paa\" means that if all are asleep, then Paa. Then, if Alice is asleep and Bob is not, the antecedent is false, so the implication holds regardless of Paa. But if Alice is asleep and Bob is awake, Paa could be false and the statement still holds. However, if Alice is asleep and Paa is false, then the implication would be false only if all monkeys are asleep. But if not all are asleep, it's okay.\n\nCase 2: If it's \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa ), then if Alice is asleep, Paa must be true. Bob's state doesn't matter. So even if only one monkey is asleep, Paa must be true.\n\nWhich interpretation fits the original sentence better? The original says \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" which seems to suggest that the entire condition of all being asleep depends on Paa. However, in natural language, sometimes \"only if\" can be used in a way that applies to each instance. For example, \"Every student passed only if the exam was easy\" would mean that for each student, if they passed, then the exam was easy. So that would be \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 Passed(x) \u2192 EasyExam). In that case, the \"only if\" applies per individual. Similarly, here, \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" might mean that each monkey's being asleep requires that Paa. Hence, \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa ). \n\nThis seems more plausible. Because if you say \"Every monkey is asleep only if Alfred saw Alfred,\" it's likely that for each monkey, their being asleep depends on Paa. So if even one monkey is asleep, then Paa must be true. Therefore, the correct formalization would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa ). \n\nSo putting it all together, the consequent is \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa ). Therefore, the entire implication is \u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa ). \n\nAlternatively, using the material implication, since (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C is equivalent to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C), we can write it as \u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Paa)). But both forms are equivalent. The user's example uses the arrow directly, so perhaps it's better to follow that style. \n\nSo the final formula is: \u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa)\n\nNow, checking the abbreviations:\n\n- R is [1] chased [2], so Hazel chasing Hazel is Rcc. The negation is \u00acRcc.\n\n- O is [1] is a monkey: Ox.\n\n- J is [1] is asleep: Jx.\n\n- P is [1] saw [2], so Alfred saw Alfred is Paa.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo combining all, the formula should be:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa)\n\nWhich is a well-formed formula in predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Paa)",

The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred will run only if every human saw Hazel.\" So the overall form is \"If A, then (B only if C)\".\n\nLet me parse each part. \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all humans are asleep\". In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) because the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential with the negated implication. But maybe I should stick with the direct negation for clarity here unless there's a reason to convert it. But since the problem allows using the abbreviations given, I need to represent it using N and J as defined.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Alfred will run only if every human saw Hazel.\" The \"only if\" part usually translates to an implication where the sufficient condition is the second part. So \"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. Here, B is \"Alfred will run\" (Fa) and C is \"every human saw Hazel.\" So the consequent becomes Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc), since P is \"[1] saw [2]\" and c is Hazel. Wait, every human saw Hazel would be for all x, if Nx then Pxc.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is:\n\nIf \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx), then (Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)).\n\nSo combining these with the implication symbol:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a more simplified form. The antecedent could be written as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), but since the problem didn't specify to convert it, and the example used the direct negation of the universal (like in the example with \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc)), perhaps it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) here as well. The example had \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), so the negation would be \u00ac\u2200x(...). So I think that's acceptable.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nLet me check again. The original sentence is: If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred will run only if every human saw Hazel. \n\nYes, the structure is correct. The antecedent is the negation of \"all humans are asleep\", which is correct. The consequent is \"Alfred will run only if every human saw Hazel\", which translates to \"If Alfred runs, then every human saw Hazel\", so Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc). \n\nI need to make sure that the variables are properly quantified. The first part uses x, but in the consequent, when I use \u2200x again, it's okay because variables can be reused with different quantifiers. Each \u2200x is scoped within their own part of the formula.\n\nSo the entire formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nYes, that looks right. Let me check if I used all abbreviations correctly:\n\n- N: [1] is a human. Correct, used for Nx.\n- J: [1] is asleep. Correct, Jx.\n- F: [1] will run. Correct, Fa.\n- a: Alfred. Correct.\n- P: [1] saw [2]. Correct, Pxc where x is the human and c is Hazel.\n- c: Hazel. Correct.\n\nNo other abbreviations are needed.

The sentence is: \"Not all monkeys chased Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, I should parse the sentence structure. The main connective here is \"only if,\" which in logic translates to an implication where the antecedent is the \"not all monkeys chased Lewis\" part and the consequent is \"not all humans kicked Hazel.\" So the structure is: [Not all monkeys chased Lewis] only if [not all humans kicked Hazel], which in logical terms would be [Not all monkeys chased Lewis] \u2192 [Not all humans kicked Hazel].\n\nNow, let's break down each part. Starting with \"Not all monkeys chased Lewis.\" The negation of \"all monkeys chased Lewis.\" The standard way to express \"all A did B\" is \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)). So the negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb), where O is \"is a monkey\" and R is \"chased,\" with b being Lewis. Alternatively, the negation of \"all\" can be expressed as \"there exists at least one that does not,\" so that becomes \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acRxb). Wait, which is correct? The negation of \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) is indeed \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acRxb). So the first part is \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) which is equivalent to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acRxb). But in the overall implication, we need to represent \"Not all...\" so maybe it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(...).\n\nSimilarly, the second part is \"not all humans kicked Hazel.\" Using the same logic, that would be \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyc), where N is \"is a human,\" Q is \"kicked,\" and c is Hazel. Alternatively, \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u00acQyc).\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire implication is: \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyc). However, since variables can be reused if they are in different scopes, maybe we can use the same variable, but typically different variables are used for different quantifiers. But in this case, since the two parts are separate, it's better to use different variables. Wait, but in the first part, the variable is x, and in the second part, perhaps y. However, in formal logic, the variables are bound by their quantifiers, so using different variables is fine. However, in the original problem, the user might expect the same variable if they are not related. But since they are separate quantifiers, using different variables is standard. But maybe in the answer, since they are separate, we can use x and y. Wait, but the first part uses x as the variable for monkeys, the second part uses y for humans. So the formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyc)\n\nAlternatively, since the variables are bound, we could use x in both, but that's not necessary. However, in formal logic, it's acceptable to reuse variables as long as they are bound by different quantifiers. But to avoid confusion, using different variables is better. However, the problem doesn't specify whether variables need to be distinct. Given that, perhaps the answer would use x in both, but I think it's more correct to use separate variables. Let me check.\n\nIn standard predicate logic, when you have multiple quantifiers, you can use the same variable if they are in different scopes. For example, \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203x Q(x) is acceptable. So in this case, the variables are in different scopes, so using x in both is allowed. So maybe the answer is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxc)\n\nBut perhaps the user expects different variables. However, since the problem doesn't specify, either way is acceptable. However, in practice, using different variables is clearer. Let me check the example given. In the example, the formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). The example uses x as the variable. So if we follow that, maybe using x and y here would be better. Let me proceed with different variables.\n\nSo the first part is \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) and the second part is \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyc). Therefore, the implication is \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyc). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, the negation of \"all monkeys chased Lewis\" is \"there exists a monkey who did not chase Lewis,\" which is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acRxb). Similarly, the negation of \"all humans kicked Hazel\" is \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u00acQyc). So the implication can also be written as \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acRxb) \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u00acQyc). Are these two equivalent? Yes, because \u00ac\u2200 is equivalent to \u2203\u00ac. So both forms are equivalent. However, the original sentence uses \"not all,\" which is directly translated as \u00ac\u2200. But depending on the preference, either form is acceptable. However, the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax. The example uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), so following that pattern, perhaps using the negation of the universal quantifier is better here.\n\nTherefore, the formalization would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Qyc)\n\nBut since variables are bound, we can also use x in both parts. So:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Qxc)\n\nBut using different variables is better to avoid confusion. However, in formal logic, it's allowed. Let me check if the problem requires distinct variables. The problem doesn't specify, so both are acceptable. However, the example uses a single variable x. So perhaps in the answer, using x and y is better. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyc)\n\nThat should be the correct formalization. Let me double-check the original sentence. The sentence is \"Not all monkeys chased Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" translates to the implication where the antecedent is the \"not all...\" part. So the structure is A only if B translates to A \u2192 B. Therefore, the formula is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxb)\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(Ny\u2192Qyc)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this logic translation problem. First, I need to parse the sentence carefully. The sentence is: \"If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" \n\nBreaking it down, the main structure seems to be a conditional statement. The antecedent is \"Alfred won't attack,\" and the consequent is a bit more complex: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" \n\nLet me start by translating the antecedent. The abbreviations given are G: [1] will attack, and a: Alfred. So \"Alfred won't attack\" would be \u00acGa.\n\nNow the consequent: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" Hmm, \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. But here, the structure is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" Let me rephrase that. Let's denote \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" as the antecedent of the \"only if\" construction. So the whole consequent is: (not all donkeys saw Hazel) only if (every monkey is hungry). So that would translate to: (not all donkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (every monkey is hungry). \n\nWait, but the original is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" So yes, that would be equivalent to if (not all donkeys saw Hazel), then (every monkey is hungry). But actually, the standard translation for \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So here, A is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\", and B is \"every monkey is hungry.\" Therefore, the consequent becomes: (\u00ac\u2200donkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (\u2200monkeys are hungry).\n\nNow let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst, \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" The statement \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc), since M is [1] is a donkey, and P is [1] saw [2], with c being Hazel. So \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc), but maybe the problem expects the negation of the universal quantifier as is.\n\nThen, \"every monkey is hungry\" is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly), since O is [1] is a monkey, and L is [1] is hungry.\n\nPutting that together, the consequent is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly).\n\nSo the entire statement is: \u00acGa \u2192 [ \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly) ].\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes people prefer to simplify or rephrase. Let me check if there's another way. Alternatively, the original sentence might be structured as \"If not Ga, then (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Ly))\". That seems correct.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I'm not missing any parentheses. Also, variables should be properly quantified. Let me check again.\n\nThe antecedent is \u00acGa. The consequent is a conditional where the antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc) and the consequent is \u2200y(Oy\u2192Ly). So the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications associate to the right, so parentheses might be optional, but to be safe, I should include them. However, the problem says to return a well-formed formula, so proper parentheses are necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire consequent can be written as (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly). So the main connective is the implication between \u00acGa and that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization should be:\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly))\n\nBut I need to check if there's a way to simplify this. For example, using logical equivalences. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given and return the formula in standard syntax. So I think this is acceptable.\n\nWait, another thought: The original sentence says \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" So maybe the \"only if\" is creating a biconditional? No, \"only if\" is typically a material implication. For example, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B, not a biconditional. So that part is correct.\n\nLet me check if the variables are properly used. The first part uses x for donkeys, and the second uses y for monkeys. Since they are separate quantifiers, using different variables is correct. Also, in predicate logic, the variables can be reused as long as they are properly bound. So x and y are different variables here.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly))\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check again each part:\n\n- \"Alfred won't attack\": \u00acGa. Correct.\n\n- \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\": \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). Correct.\n\n- \"every monkey is hungry\": \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Ly). Correct.\n\nSo the structure is: If \u00acGa, then (if \u00ac\u2200x... then \u2200y...). Yes.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The entire statement is a conditional where the antecedent is \u00acGa and the consequent is (\u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 \u2200y...). So that's how it should be written.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc)\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192Ly))",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"No donkeys ate.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. The abbreviations are M for \"[1] is a donkey\" and I for \"[1] ate.\" \n\nFirst, \"No donkeys ate\" means that there doesn't exist any donkey that ate. So in logical terms, it's a negation of existence. The structure would be something like \"It is not the case that there exists an x such that x is a donkey and x ate.\" \n\nIn symbols, that would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Let me check. The existential quantifier \u2203x is used here because we're talking about existence, and then we negate it. The conjunction inside is because both conditions must hold for the same x: being a donkey and eating.\n\nAlternatively, could it be expressed as a universal quantifier? Like \"All donkeys did not eat,\" which would translate to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). But which one is correct? Let's think. Both forms are equivalent in classical logic. The original statement \"No donkeys ate\" can be interpreted as \"For all x, if x is a donkey, then x did not eat.\" So that would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). But also, the negation of the existential is equivalent. So both forms are correct, but which one is the standard formalization?\n\nIn predicate logic, \"No S is P\" is typically translated as \u2200x (Sx \u2192 \u00acPx) or equivalently \u00ac\u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). But the question is about which form to use here. The example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier with implication for \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" which is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So following that pattern, perhaps the universal form is preferred here.\n\nBut let's check the example again. The example's sentence is a universal affirmative, and the formalization uses \u2200 with implication. For a universal negative like \"No S is P,\" the standard formalization is \u2200x (Sx \u2192 \u00acPx). So in this case, the correct translation would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). However, another valid way is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Which one does the problem expect?\n\nThe problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Both forms are possible. However, the example uses a universal quantifier, so maybe the expected answer is using universal quantifier here as well. But maybe the problem expects the negation of the existential. Let me think again. \n\nIn the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So for \"No donkeys ate,\" which is a universal statement, the structure is similar but with negation. The standard way is to use \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Alternatively, using the negation of the existential. But perhaps the answer is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Let me check which one is more appropriate. \n\nIn traditional logic, \"No S is P\" is translated as \u2200x (Sx \u2192 \u00acPx). However, in predicate logic, both forms are equivalent. Since the problem doesn't specify any preference, but the example uses a universal quantifier, maybe we should follow that. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are correct, but maybe the expected answer is the universal form. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the negation of the existential. For example, \"No donkeys ate\" is equivalent to \"It is not the case that some donkey ate.\" So \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) is \"Some donkey ate,\" so negating it gives \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Which is equivalent to \u2200x (\u00acMx \u2228 \u00acIx), which is the same as \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). So both are correct. \n\nBut in the example, the universal quantifier is used. So maybe the answer here should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). However, the problem might prefer the negation of the existential. Let me check the problem's example again. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So for a universal statement, they used the universal quantifier. For \"No donkeys ate,\" which is a universal negative, the standard formalization is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Therefore, I think that is the correct approach here. \n\nSo the answer should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Let me write that in the correct symbols. Using the standard syntax, it would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acIx). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the negation of the existential, then it's \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). But which one is more likely? The example uses the universal quantifier, so perhaps the same approach is expected here. \n\nIn summary, both are logically equivalent, but following the example's pattern, using the universal quantifier with implication is probably the expected answer. Therefore, the formalization is \u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acIx).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acIx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to translate is: \"A human will attack and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"[1] is a human\", G for \"[1] will attack\", M for \"[1] is a donkey\", Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\", and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The sentence has two main parts connected by \"and\": \"A human will attack\" and \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" Let's handle each part separately.\n\nStarting with \"A human will attack.\" This seems to be an existential statement. The phrase \"A human\" suggests there exists at least one human. So, using the abbreviation N for being a human and G for will attack, this part would be translated as \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx). Wait, but sometimes \"A human will attack\" could be interpreted as \"If there is a human, then they will attack,\" but that seems less likely. The correct interpretation here is that there exists a human who will attack, so existential quantifier with conjunction.\n\nNext part: \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" The phrase \"not all\" typically translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. The original statement \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx a). So negating that gives \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx a). Alternatively, using the equivalence between \u00ac\u2200 and \u2203\u00ac, this becomes \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx a). So \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is equivalent to \"there exists a donkey who did not kick Alfred.\"\n\nPutting the two parts together with \"and\": The entire sentence is the conjunction of the two statements. So we have \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acQy a). However, we can use the same variable for both existentials if we don't need to distinguish them, but since they are separate existentials, it's better to keep them as separate variables. However, in predicate logic, variables are just placeholders, so using x and y or x and x is acceptable as long as they are properly quantified. Wait, but if we use \u2203x and \u2203x again, does that cause confusion? Probably better to use different variables to avoid any possible confusion, even though technically they are separate scopes. Let me check: the first existential is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx), and the second is \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acQy a). So combining them with \u2227, the entire formula would be [\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx)] \u2227 [\u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acQy a)].\n\nBut maybe we can use the same variable, like \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx a). However, since the two existentials are separate, the variable name doesn't conflict because each quantifier has its own scope. So it's acceptable to reuse x, but using different variables (like x and y) is also fine. The problem doesn't specify whether variables need to be unique, so either way is correct. However, in formal logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers, so reusing the same variable is allowed. For simplicity, perhaps the answer expects using x in both, but I'll check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is a single existential and the second is another. So the final formula would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx a). But perhaps using different variables is better for clarity. However, the example given in the problem uses a single variable (x) for the universal quantifier. The example was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So maybe following that, we can use x in both existentials. Let me proceed with that.\n\nNow, combining both parts with \u2227. So the entire formula is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx a). Wait, but the second part is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" which we translated as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQx a). So the entire formula is the conjunction of the two existentials. \n\nBut let me double-check the translation of \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" The original statement is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" which is equivalent to \"there exists a donkey that did not kick Alfred.\" So yes, that's correct. So the second part is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). \n\nPutting it all together: The first part is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx), the second is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa), and they are connected by \u2227. So the entire formula is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). However, in predicate logic, variables can be reused across different quantifiers as long as they are in separate scopes. So this is acceptable. Alternatively, using different variables for clarity, like \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acQya), but the problem doesn't specify, so either is correct. The example uses x in the universal quantifier, so perhaps the answer expects using x again here. \n\nTherefore, the final formalization should be the conjunction of the two existential statements. Let me write that out:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa)\n\nBut wait, in the second part, the variable x is bound by the existential quantifier, so even if we use the same x, it's okay. However, in practice, some prefer to use different variables for different quantifiers to avoid confusion. But since the problem doesn't specify, either way is acceptable. Let me check if there's a standard convention. In formal logic, it's allowed to reuse variables as long as they are in different scopes. So the formula is correct as written. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). However, sometimes people might use different variables for each quantifier. For example, \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203y(My \u2227 \u00acQya). But the problem doesn't specify variable names, so both are correct. However, in the example given, the universal quantifier uses x, so perhaps the answer expects using x in the existential as well. Let me stick with x in both for consistency with the example. \n\nSo the final answer is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). But wait, the second part is about donkeys, so the variable in the second existential is also x. But that's okay. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a different variable. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"A human will attack and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" The first part is about a human, the second about donkeys. The variables are different entities (a human vs. donkeys), so using different variables might be better. For example, \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203y(My \u2227 \u00acQya). But again, since variables are just placeholders, it's acceptable to use the same variable. \n\nHowever, in formal logic, when you have multiple quantifiers, you can reuse variables as long as they are in different scopes. So \u2203x... \u2227 \u2203x... is allowed. Therefore, the answer is correct either way. Given that the example uses x in the universal quantifier, and the problem doesn't specify variable names, I think it's safe to use x in both. \n\nSo the final formula is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). Alternatively, with different variables. But since the problem didn't specify, I'll proceed with the same variable. \n\nWait, but in the example, the universal quantifier uses x, and that's the only quantifier. Here, we have two existential quantifiers. So perhaps the answer expects using x in both. Therefore, the correct formalization is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the second part to use a different variable. But without specific instructions, it's hard to tell. However, in formal logic, variables are just dummy variables, so reusing them is acceptable. Therefore, the answer should be correct as written.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Gx) \u2227 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa)",

So the correct way is to negate Q with c and a as arguments. \n\nSo Hazel didn't kick Alfred translates to \u00acQ(c, a). There's no need for quantifiers here because both c and a are constants. The original example had a universal quantifier because it was making a general statement about all linguists, but here we're talking about a specific instance between Hazel and Alfred. So the formalization should just be the negation of Q applied to c and a. \n\nLet me double-check. The sentence is straightforward negation of a binary predicate with two constants.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"No humans chased every human.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the abbreviations provided are N for \"[1] is a human\" and R for \"[1] chased [2]\". The sentence says that there's no human who chased every human. So, in other words, for all humans, it's not the case that they chased every human. Alternatively, it could also be phrased as there does not exist a human such that for every human, that first human chased them.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The original sentence is a universal negative statement. In logic, \"No A are B\" would be translated as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx), but here the structure is a bit different because it's about actions. The sentence is about humans not doing an action (chasing every human).\n\nSo, the main idea is to negate the existence of a human who chased every human. So, the existential quantifier would be negated. That would be \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Rxy)). Wait, let me check that. The person x must be a human, and for every y, if y is a human, then x chased y. So, the inner part is Nx (x is human) and for all y, if Ny then Rxy. Then, we negate the existence of such x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to structure it as: For all x, if x is a human, then it is not the case that for all y (if y is a human, then x chased y). That would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Rxy)). But which one is correct?\n\nLet me think. The original sentence is \"No humans chased every human.\" This can be read as \"It is not the case that there exists a human who chased every human.\" So the correct approach is to negate the existence. So the first approach: \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Rxy)). \n\nBut I need to make sure that the translation is accurate. Let's consider that \"chased every human\" means that for every human y, x chased y. So the part inside is Nx (since x must be a human) and for every y, if y is a human, then Rxy. Therefore, the entire statement is saying there is no such x. Hence, the negation of \u2203x(...). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2203x [Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Rxy)].\n\nAlternatively, by moving the negation inside using quantifier duality, this is equivalent to \u2200x \u00ac[Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Rxy)], which can be further transformed into \u2200x [\u00acNx \u2228 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Rxy)], but perhaps the original form with the negation outside the existential quantifier is more straightforward.\n\nSo the answer should be \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Rxy)). Let me check if there are any possible errors here. For example, does the original sentence allow for the possibility that there are non-human entities that chased every human? But the sentence specifically says \"No humans...\", so we are only concerned with humans not doing that action. Therefore, the x in question must be a human, hence Nx is required. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct formalization is the negation of the existence of a human x such that for every human y, x chased y. So the formula is \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Rxy)). \n\nI should also check if the connectives are correct. Inside the existential quantifier, we have Nx (x is a human) and for all y, if y is a human then x chased y. That seems right. The \"chased every human\" requires that for every human y, Rxy holds. So yes, that's \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Rxy). \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Rxy)).\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Rxy))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel is hungry only if every monkey is hungry.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B.\" So A is \"every monkey chased Hazel,\" and B is \"Hazel is hungry only if every monkey is hungry.\" \n\nStarting with A: \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a monkey\" is O, and \"[1] chased [2]\" is R. Hazel is represented by c. So \"every monkey chased Hazel\" would be a universal quantifier over all x where Ox (x is a monkey) implies Rxc (x chased Hazel). So that's \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc).\n\nNow the consequent B: \"Hazel is hungry only if every monkey is hungry.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is hungry\" is L. \"Only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, Hazel being hungry (Lc) is the P, and the Q is \"every monkey is hungry.\" \n\nSo \"every monkey is hungry\" would be another universal quantifier: \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). Because for every x, if x is a monkey, then x is hungry.\n\nPutting B together: Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx). \n\nSo the entire conditional is: If A then B. So the whole formula is A \u2192 B. \n\nPutting it all together: [\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc)] \u2192 [Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx)]. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the scope of the quantifiers and the connectives. Let me check again. The antecedent is \u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc). The consequent is Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx). So the main connective is the implication between those two parts. \n\nI need to make sure that the variables are correctly scoped. The x in the antecedent is bound by the universal quantifier. In the consequent, there's another universal quantifier for x. Since variables can be reused as long as they are bound, that's okay. \n\nSo the final formula should be: \u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx)). \n\nBut wait, sometimes in logic, when you have multiple quantifiers, you have to make sure they don't conflict. But here, the x in the antecedent is separate from the x in the consequent. However, since they are both bound by their own quantifiers, it's acceptable. Alternatively, to avoid confusion, maybe the second quantifier could use a different variable, like y. But the problem says to use the abbreviations given and not to add any extra symbols. The abbreviation for \"is a monkey\" is O, so the variable is just x. So I think it's okay to have two universal quantifiers with x in different scopes. \n\nAnother way to write it would be to use different variables, but since the original sentence doesn't mention other entities, maybe it's not necessary. Let me check the example given. In the example, they used x in both the antecedent and the consequent, like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if there's another quantifier in the consequent, they would reuse x. So I think it's acceptable here. \n\nTherefore, the formalization is correct as written. Let me just write it out again:\n\n\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nYes, that seems right. The antecedent is the universal statement about monkeys chasing Hazel, and the consequent is the implication that if Hazel is hungry, then all monkeys are hungry.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(Lc\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx))",

So, the sentence is: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred will run only if every monkey is asleep.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. So the overall form is A \u2192 B. Now, I need to figure out what A and B are.\n\nA is \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and P is \"[1] saw [2]\". So \"every monkey saw Lewis\" would be a universal quantification. For all x, if O(x) then P(x, b), since b is Lewis. So A is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb).\n\nThen the consequent is \"Alfred will run only if every monkey is asleep.\" Let's parse that. The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is saying that if Alfred will run, then every monkey is asleep. So F(a) \u2192 [something]. The [something] is \"every monkey is asleep,\" which uses J: \"[1] is asleep\". So again, universal quantifier: \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb), then (F(a) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx)). So the formula would be:\n\n(\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx))\n\nWait, but I need to check if the variables are properly scoped. The first part is about all monkeys seeing Lewis, then the consequent has two parts. The second part is about all monkeys being asleep. The variables in the consequent use x again, but since they're inside their own quantifiers, it should be okay. Each quantifier is separate, so the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent are separate. So the formula should be correct.\n\nLet me double-check the \"only if\" part. The original says \"Alfred will run only if every monkey is asleep.\" So Alfred running is conditional on all monkeys being asleep. So yes, F(a) implies the universal statement. So the translation of the consequent is Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx). \n\nSo combining both parts, the entire implication is the antecedent (all monkeys saw Lewis) leading to that consequent. Therefore, the formalization should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx))\n\nI think that's correct. Let me make sure there are no parentheses issues. The main connective is the implication between the two big parts. Then inside the consequent, there's another implication between Fa and the universal. So parentheses are needed to group them properly. Yes, that looks right. Also, the abbreviations are all used correctly: O for monkey, P for saw with b (Lewis), F for will run with a (Alfred), and J for asleep. No other symbols are needed. I don't see any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192(Fa\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Jx))",

The sentence is: \"A monkey chased Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"A monkey chased Alfred.\" The second part is \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\" Let's handle each part separately.\n\nFor the first part, \"A monkey chased Alfred.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a monkey\" is O, and \"[1] chased [2]\" is R. Alfred is represented by 'a'. So, \"A monkey chased Alfred\" would translate to an existential statement: there exists some x such that O(x) (x is a monkey) and R(x, a) (x chased Alfred). So that's \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Rxa).\n\nNow the second part: \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a donkey\" is M, and Lewis is 'b'. The phrase \"isn't a donkey\" would be \u00acM(b). Then, \"it is not the case that...\" would be the negation of that, so \u00ac\u00acMb. But double negation cancels out, so this simplifies to Mb. So the second part is asserting that Lewis is a donkey.\n\nPutting the two parts together with \"but,\" which is logically equivalent to \"and,\" so we combine the two statements with \u2227. Therefore, the entire formula should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Rxa) \u2227 Mb.\n\nWait, let me check again. The original sentence says \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\" So that's \u00ac(\u00acMb), which is equivalent to Mb. So yes, the second part is just Mb. So combining both parts, it's the conjunction of the existential statement and Mb.\n\nSo the final formula should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Rxa) \u2227 Mb. Let me make sure I didn't miss any quantifiers or connectives. The first part requires an existential quantifier because it's \"a monkey\" (existential). The second part is a simple assertion about Lewis being a donkey. The 'but' is just a conjunction. Looks correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Rxa) \u2227 Mb",

The abbreviations are M for [1] is a donkey and R for [1] chased [2]. \n\nFirst, the sentence is stating that there exists a donkey that chased another donkey. Since both the subject and the object are donkeys, but they might not be the same one. So, I need to use existential quantifiers here.\n\nSo, the structure would be something like \"There exists an x such that M(x) and there exists a y such that M(y) and R(x,y).\" Wait, but maybe I can combine the quantifiers. Since both are existentials, can I write it as \u2203x \u2203y (M(x) \u2227 M(y) \u2227 R(x,y))? That seems right. \n\nBut let me check. The original sentence is \"A donkey chased a donkey.\" This is an existential statement: there is at least one donkey (the chaser) and at least one donkey (the chasee) such that the first chased the second. The two donkeys could be the same or different, but the sentence doesn't specify. However, in predicate logic, unless we have identity, we can't specify they are different. Since the problem doesn't mention using identity (like =), I should assume they can be the same or different. \n\nSo the correct formalization would be \u2203x \u2203y (Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Rxy). Let me make sure I'm using the abbreviations correctly. M is for \"is a donkey,\" so Mx and My. R is \"[1] chased [2],\" so Rxy means x chased y. Yes, that seems right. \n\nI need to use the symbols properly. The quantifiers should be \u2200 or \u2203. Since it's \"a donkey,\" which is existential. So \u2203x and \u2203y. The connectives are \u2227 between the conditions. So putting it all together: \u2203x\u2203y(Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Rxy). \n\nI don't think there's a need for any implication here because we're asserting the existence of two donkeys with the chasing relation. The example given in the problem had an implication for \"Every linguist,\" but here it's an existential. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the final formula should be \u2203x\u2203y(Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Rxy). Let me check again.

First, I need to parse the sentence: \"If not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is a donkey.\" The abbreviations given are N for human, J for asleep, M for donkey, P for saw, c for Hazel, and b for Lewis.\n\nThe main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the sentence says \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is a donkey.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So the entire structure is: If (not all humans are asleep), then (not all donkeys saw Hazel) only if (Lewis is a donkey). Let me rephrase the sentence to make sure. The main conditional is: If \u00ac(all humans are asleep), then [ (not all donkeys saw Hazel) only if (M(b)) ].\n\nBreaking down the antecedent first: \"Not all humans are asleep\" translates to \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is a donkey.\" Let's parse this. The \"only if\" here links the two parts. So, if we have \"A only if B\", it's A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\", and B is \"Lewis is a donkey\". So the consequent would be (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc)) \u2192 Mb. Wait, but \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is equivalent to \u2203y(My \u2227 \u00acPyc). But in the \"only if\" structure, the antecedent is the \"not all...\" part. So the consequent of the main conditional is (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc)) \u2192 Mb. Alternatively, since \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is \u2203y(My \u2227 \u00acPyc), but I think the correct way is to keep it as \u00ac\u2200... because \"only if\" is a material implication.\n\nPutting it all together: The entire statement is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc)) \u2192 Mb ]\n\nBut let me check if I need to handle the scope correctly. The main conditional is: If [not all humans asleep], then [ (not all donkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 Mb ].\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formalization would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 Mb)\n\nAlternatively, using the existential quantifier for the antecedent part. Since \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), but the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard symbols. So I can leave it as \u00ac\u2200x... unless there's a reason to convert it. But the example given uses \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), so the original form is acceptable.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Pyc) \u2192 Mb)\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up the structure. The sentence says \"If not all humans are asleep, then [not all donkeys saw Hazel] only if [Lewis is a donkey].\" So the \"only if\" applies to the consequent part. So the structure is: If A, then (B only if C), which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Therefore, yes, the consequent is (B \u2192 C), where B is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" and C is Mb.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is correct. Now check if the variables are properly quantified. The first part is about x (humans), the second part about y (donkeys). Using different variables is good to avoid confusion. So the formula is well-formed.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Pyc)\u2192Mb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is: \"If every human is asleep, then Hazel is hungry only if a human chased Hazel.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components using the given abbreviations. The abbreviations are N for \"is a human,\" J for \"is asleep,\" L for \"is hungry,\" c for Hazel, and R for \"chased.\"\n\nThe main structure here is a conditional statement: If A, then B. Where A is \"every human is asleep,\" and B is \"Hazel is hungry only if a human chased Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"Every human is asleep.\" Using the abbreviations, that would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Because for all x, if x is a human (Nx), then x is asleep (Jx).\n\nNow B: \"Hazel is hungry only if a human chased Hazel.\" The \"only if\" part can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, Hazel being hungry (Lc) is the P, and the Q is \"a human chased Hazel,\" which would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rx,c). Wait, because there exists some x who is a human (Nx) and who chased Hazel (Rx,c, since R is [1] chased [2], so x chased c).\n\nSo putting B together: Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). Wait, but the subject here is Hazel. So the sentence is saying that if Hazel is hungry, then there must be a human who chased her. So yes, Lc implies the existence of such a human.\n\nNow combining A and B with the main conditional. The entire sentence is \"If A, then B,\" so that would be A \u2192 B. So:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nWait, but I need to check if the quantifiers are correctly placed. Let me make sure. The entire formula is a material implication where the antecedent is \u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) and the consequent is Lc\u2192\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). That seems right. Let me check for possible scope issues. The main connective is the implication between the two parts. The consequent itself is another implication. So the structure is correct.\n\nI think that's it. Let me write that out properly with the correct symbols. The final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(Lc\u2192\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxc))\n\nI need to make sure that I didn't mix up any variables. The Hazel in the second part is represented by c, so in Rxc, x is the chaser (human) and c is Hazel. Yes, that's correct. Also, in the consequent, the existential quantifier is necessary because it's saying there exists a human who chased Hazel. So \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) is correct.\n\nI don't see any other abbreviations needed here. All the predicates and constants are properly used according to the given definitions. So the final formalization should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(Lc\u2192\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem. The sentence is \"Not all monkeys ate just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"is a monkey,\" I for \"ate,\" L for \"is hungry,\" and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The phrase \"Not all monkeys ate\" is the first part. In predicate logic, \"Not all\" is usually translated as the negation of a universal quantifier. So \"All monkeys ate\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix), so \"Not all\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx), meaning there exists a monkey who didn't eat.\n\nThen there's \"just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\" The term \"just in case\" is a bit tricky. In logic, \"just in case\" typically translates to a biconditional (\u2194), but sometimes it might be a conditional. However, given the structure here, it's more likely that the entire statement is a biconditional. So the sentence is saying that the negation of all monkeys eating is equivalent to Hazel not being hungry. So the whole structure is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u00acLc.\n\nWait, but let's check. The original sentence is \"Not all monkeys ate just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\" So \"just in case\" here is setting a condition. So maybe it's a biconditional between the two propositions: the negation of all monkeys ate is equivalent to Hazel not being hungry. So the formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u00acLc. Alternatively, since \"just in case\" can sometimes be read as a material conditional, but I think in this context, since it's \"just in case,\" it's more about equivalence. Let me think again. If the sentence were \"I will go just in case it rains,\" that would mean \"I will go if and only if it rains.\" So yes, biconditional. So here, \"Not all monkeys ate if and only if Hazel isn't hungry.\" Therefore, the correct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u00acLc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is that the entire \"Not all monkeys ate\" is the antecedent, and \"Hazel isn't hungry\" is the consequent, but with \"just in case\" acting as a conditional. Wait, but \"just in case\" is different. Let me check. For example, \"I'll bring an umbrella just in case it rains\" is more like \"I'll bring an umbrella if it rains,\" which is a conditional. But in that case, the structure is \"A just in case B\" would be B \u2192 A. Wait, no. If I say \"I'll bring an umbrella just in case it rains,\" that might mean \"If it rains, I'll bring an umbrella,\" which is B \u2192 A. But sometimes people use it to mean \"A if and only if B,\" but that's less common. However, in the example given in the problem's instruction, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the structure is universal quantifier with implication. So for the current problem, the main connective is the biconditional between the two parts.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u00acLc. Alternatively, since Hazel isn't hungry is \u00acLc, and the left side is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). So the biconditional between them. Therefore, the final formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 \u00acLc.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix)\u2194\u00acLc",

The sentence is \"No monkeys chased a donkey that chased it.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations: O for monkey, M for donkey, and R for chased.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is \"No monkeys chased a donkey that chased it.\" So, the key parts are:\n\n- No monkeys (O) did something.\n- The something is \"chased a donkey that chased it.\" So, the monkey chased a donkey, and that donkey chased the monkey (since \"it\" refers back to the monkey, I think).\n\nWait, the pronoun \"it\" here is ambiguous, but in such sentences, usually, \"it\" refers to the subject. So if the monkey chased a donkey that chased it (the monkey), then the donkey chased the monkey. So the structure is: For all monkeys, there does not exist a donkey such that the monkey chased the donkey and the donkey chased the monkey.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"No monkey chased any donkey that chased it.\" So, for any monkey, there is no donkey that was chased by the monkey and that donkey also chased the monkey.\n\nSo, the formalization would be: For all x, if x is a monkey, then it is not the case that there exists a y such that y is a donkey, and x chased y, and y chased x.\n\nBreaking that down:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx))\n\nWait, but the original sentence says \"chased a donkey that chased it.\" So the monkey chased a donkey (so Rxy where x is monkey, y is donkey), and that donkey chased \"it\"\u2014the \"it\" here is the monkey, so Ryx. So yes, the conjunction of Rxy and Ryx.\n\nSo the entire formula would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx)).\n\nAlternatively, could it be structured as \"No monkey chased a donkey (which chased it)\"? So the \"that chased it\" is a relative clause modifying \"donkey.\" So for any donkey that was chased by the monkey, that donkey also chased the monkey. Therefore, the existence of such a donkey is denied.\n\nYes, so the formula would be correct as above.\n\nAnother way to check: The original sentence is equivalent to \"For all monkeys x, there does not exist a donkey y such that x chased y and y chased x.\" So that's exactly the formula I wrote.\n\nSo using the abbreviations O, M, R, the formalization is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx)).\n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the correct quantifiers and connectives. Also, checking if \"No A B\" translates to \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx)... but here B is more complex.\n\nYes, \"No A's are such that they B\" becomes \u2200x (Ax \u2192 \u00acBx). In this case, B is \"chased a donkey that chased it\", which for each x, would involve an existence of y. Hence, the negation of the existence.\n\nSo the final formula should be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx)).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(My\u2227Rxy\u2227Ryx))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"A human saw Hazel if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is an \"if and only if\" statement, which in logic is represented by the biconditional symbol \u2194. So the formula will have two parts connected by \u2194.\n\nThe left side of the biconditional is \"A human saw Hazel.\" The right side is \"every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the left part: \"A human saw Hazel.\" The abbreviation for \"human\" is N: [1] is a human. \"Saw\" is P: [1] saw [2]. Hazel is represented by c. So \"A human saw Hazel\" would be an existential quantifier, because there exists at least one human who saw Hazel. So that would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Pxc). Wait, because we need to say there's an x that is a human and x saw c (Hazel). \n\nNow the right part: \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" The abbreviation for monkey is O: [1] is a monkey. \"Chased\" is R: [1] chased [2]. So \"every monkey chased Hazel\" would be a universal quantifier. For all x, if Ox (x is a monkey), then Rx c (x chased Hazel). So \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is the biconditional between these two parts. So the formula is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Pxc) \u2194 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc).\n\nWait, but I need to check if the variables are properly scoped. The left side uses \u2203x, and the right uses \u2200x. Since they are separate quantifiers, they can use the same variable name because their scope is different. But sometimes people might use different variables to avoid confusion, but the problem doesn't specify that. The example given uses x in both parts. For instance, in the example, they have \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So in this case, the right side is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc). So the left side is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Pxc). So combining them with \u2194, it's \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Pxc) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final formula should be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Pxc) \u2194 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc). Let me double-check the abbreviations. N for human, P for saw, c is Hazel, O for monkey, R for chased. Yep, that's right. The left side is existence of a human who saw Hazel, the right is all monkeys chased Hazel. The biconditional connects them. So the answer should be that formula.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Pxc)\u2194\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)",

The sentence to formalize is: \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The main structure is a conditional statement: If A, then B. Where A is \"every monkey chased Hazel\" and B is \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations given, O represents \"[1] is a monkey,\" R is \"[1] chased [2],\" and c is Hazel. So, for all x, if O(x) then R(x, c). That would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent B: \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, for every monkey, if the monkey is asleep, then Lewis won't run. Let's parse that. \n\n\"Every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run\" would be: For all x, if O(x) and J(x) (since J is \"[1] is asleep\"), then \u00acF(b) (because F is \"[1] will run\" and Lewis is b, so \"Lewis won't run\" is \u00acFb). Wait, but \"only if\" connects the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" to \"Lewis won't run.\" Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the structure is: For every monkey, being asleep implies that Lewis won't run. So for each monkey x, if x is asleep, then \u00acFb. But since the original says \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run,\" it's equivalent to saying that if all monkeys are asleep, then Lewis won't run? Wait, no. The wording is \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" which is a universal statement. Let me recall that \"only if\" in a universal statement. For example, \"Every A is B only if C\" would be translated as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx) \u2192 C. Wait, but here the \"only if\" is inside the universal quantifier? Or is it?\n\nWait, the original B is \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run.\" Let me parse this as: For every monkey, if it is asleep, then Lewis won't run. Because \"only if\" connects the individual's being asleep to Lewis not running. So for each monkey x, Jx (asleep) \u2192 \u00acFb. But since the statement is about every monkey, maybe it's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acFb)). Because for every x, if x is a monkey, then if x is asleep, then Lewis won't run.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb). But that would mean that if there's any monkey that is asleep, then Lewis won't run. But the original sentence says \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" which is similar to saying that the entire set of monkeys being asleep requires Lewis not running. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe difference between \"Every A is B only if C\" versus \"Every A is B only if C\". The first interpretation is that if every A is B, then C. So in this case, if every monkey is asleep, then Lewis won't run. So that would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acFb. But the original sentence says \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run.\" So that would be the case. So the consequent B is: If all monkeys are asleep, then Lewis doesn't run. But how does that fit into the original sentence?\n\nWait the original sentence is: If every monkey chased Hazel, then [every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run]. So the entire implication is: A \u2192 B, where A is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc), and B is [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb]. But that would make the whole formula: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb]. However, this can be simplified using implication rules. Because (P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R)) is equivalent to (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 R. But maybe the original sentence's structure is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"only if\" applies per monkey. Let me check the wording again. The original says \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run.\" The phrase \"only if\" here is modifying the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" condition. So, the statement is that the condition that every monkey is asleep can only hold if Lewis won't run. Which would translate to: If every monkey is asleep, then Lewis won't run. So that's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb. Therefore, combining with the antecedent A, the whole formula would be: [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc)] \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb]. \n\nBut another way to write this is to combine the implications. Since A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But perhaps the problem expects the direct translation without reordering. Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" became \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the structure is straightforward. \n\nSo for the current problem, the consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run.\" Let me think again. The \"only if\" in English is a material implication where the consequent is the \"only if\" part. So \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So if we have \"Every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run,\" that would mean that for each monkey, if it is asleep, then Lewis won't run. Wait, but that seems odd. Because if multiple monkeys are asleep, then Lewis not running would have to be true for each of them. But that's okay because \u00acFb is a single proposition. So for each monkey x, Jx \u2192 \u00acFb. Therefore, the consequent B would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acFb)). Alternatively, since Ox is already the domain, maybe \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb). \n\nBut which is correct? Let's consider. If we have \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acFb)), that's equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2227 Jx \u2192 \u00acFb). Because implication has higher precedence. So both are equivalent. So the consequent is that for any x, if x is a monkey and is asleep, then Lewis won't run. \n\nBut then, the original sentence's consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run.\" So if every monkey is asleep, then Lewis won't run. Wait, but that's different. If we take the universal statement that for every monkey, being asleep implies Lewis not running, then that would mean that if even one monkey is asleep, Lewis can't run. Whereas if we take it as \"if all monkeys are asleep, then Lewis can't run,\" that's a different condition. Which interpretation is correct?\n\nThis is a common ambiguity in English. Let's look at the example. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is straightforward. But here, the problem is with \"only if.\" Let's consider that \"only if\" in a universal statement. For example, \"Every student will pass only if they study.\" This would mean that for every student, if they pass, then they studied. So \u2200x (Student(x) \u2192 (Pass(x) \u2192 Study(x))). Which is equivalent to \u2200x ((Student(x) \u2227 Pass(x)) \u2192 Study(x)). \n\nSimilarly, in our case, \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run\" would mean that for every monkey, if it is asleep, then Lewis won't run. Therefore, \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb). \n\nBut if that's the case, then the consequent B is \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb). Therefore, the entire implication is: If \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc), then \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb). \n\nSo putting it all together, the formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb)\n\nAlternatively, since the antecedent of the inner implication is Ox \u2227 Jx, we can also write it as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acFb)), which is equivalent. \n\nNow, considering the abbreviations provided, J is \"[1] is asleep,\" so Jx would be \"x is asleep,\" F is \"[1] will run,\" so Fb is \"Lewis will run,\" so \u00acFb is \"Lewis won't run.\"\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc) \u2192 \u2200x((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u00acFb)\n\nAlternatively, using implication instead of conjunction:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192(Jx\u2192\u00acFb))\n\nBoth are logically equivalent. Which one is preferred? In predicate logic, it's common to nest implications rather than use conjunctions in the antecedent, but both are correct. However, since the example uses implication (like Lx\u2192Rxc), perhaps the second form is more in line with the example's style. Let me check the example again. The example had \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is similar to Ox\u2192Rxc here. So for consistency, using the implication form might be better.\n\nTherefore, the consequent would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acFb)). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192(Jx\u2192\u00acFb))\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible mistakes. The original sentence is a conditional where the antecedent is \"every monkey chased Hazel,\" and the consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if Lewis won't run.\" \n\nYes, so the structure is correct. Now, in terms of syntax, we need to make sure that quantifiers are properly scoped. The first \u2200x applies to Ox\u2192Rxc. The second \u2200x applies to Ox\u2192(Jx\u2192\u00acFb). \n\nSo the final formula should be written with the proper arrows and quantifiers. Also, note that in predicate logic, the scope of the quantifiers is the entire implication. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192(Jx\u2192\u00acFb))\n\nAlternatively, since the variable x is bound in both quantifiers, it's acceptable to reuse x in both, as the scope is separate. \n\nYes, that's correct. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Jx\u2192\u00acFb))",

The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. \n\nFirst, the sentence is: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run.\"\n\nLet me parse the structure. The main conditional is \"If A, then B\", where:\n- A is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\"\n- B is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). So \"not all\" is the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc). But for the translation, maybe I should stick with the negation of the universal statement unless there's a reason to switch. Since the original uses \"not all,\" maybe it's better to represent it as \u00ac\u2200x(...). \n\nNow, the consequent B: \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is translated as P \u2192 Q. So here, for each monkey, if the monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis won't run. But the structure is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if...\", so the \"only if\" applies to the entire conditional. Wait, actually, \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis won't run\" would mean that for every monkey, if they chased Hazel, then Lewis won't run. So, for all x, if Ox (monkey) then (Rx c \u2192 \u00acFb). Because R is [1] chased [2], so Rx c is x chased Hazel (c is Hazel). F is [1] will run, so Fb is Lewis (b) will run. So the negation is \u00acFb.\n\nPutting it all together: The entire implication is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 [\u2200y(Oy \u2192 (Ry c \u2192 \u00acFb))]. \n\nWait, but variables should be consistent. Let me check. The antecedent uses x, but in the consequent, if I use y, that's fine as long as it's a different variable. But maybe the original uses x in both. However, in formal logic, variables are bound locally, so it's okay to reuse variables as long as they are bound properly. But to avoid confusion, using different variables might be better. However, the problem says to return a single formula, so perhaps using x again is acceptable. Let me check.\n\nOriginal antecedent: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). The consequent is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Rx c \u2192 \u00acFb)). Since the x in the consequent is bound by a different quantifier, it's okay. So the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 \u00acFb))\n\nBut let me check if I have the abbreviations right. \n\nAbbreviations given:\nM: [1] is a donkey\nP: [1] saw [2]\nc: Hazel\nO: [1] is a monkey\nR: [1] chased [2]\nF: [1] will run\nb: Lewis\n\nYes. So the consequent is for every monkey x, if x chased c (Hazel), then \u00acFb (Lewis won't run). \n\nSo the translation should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 \u00acFb))\n\nAlternatively, since the antecedent is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\", which is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc), but the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The user's example used the universal form with negation, so I think using \u00ac\u2200x(...) is acceptable here.\n\nSo the final formula is as above. Let me make sure there are no typos.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The main structure is a conditional: \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Lewis is a donkey.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the first part of the conditional: \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, O(x) means x is a monkey, R(x, c) since c is Hazel. So this part would translate to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc). That's straightforward, similar to the example given.\n\nNow the second part is more complicated: \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Lewis is a donkey.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, the \"A\" part is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" and the \"B\" part is \"Lewis is a donkey (Mb).\"\n\nSo first, let's handle \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" The statement \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa), since M(x) is being a donkey and Q(x, a) is kicking Alfred. The negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa). But in logic, the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential with a negated inner. So \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). So \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa).\n\nPutting that into the \"only if\" structure: the entire part is (\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa)) \u2192 Mb. Because \"only if Lewis is a donkey\" translates to the implication where the antecedent is the \"not all...\" part and the consequent is Mb.\n\nNow combining both parts with the main conditional. The entire sentence is: If [every monkey chased Hazel], then [ (\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa)) \u2192 Mb ]. So the structure is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 [ (\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa)) \u2192 Mb ].\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. However, we need to make sure the variables are properly quantified. The existential quantifier in the second part is okay as it's within the scope of the implication. Also, we need to check if there are any variable conflicts. The first part uses x, the second part also uses x in the existential. But since they are in different scopes, it's acceptable. Alternatively, we could use a different variable for the existential, but since the problem allows it, using x again is fine.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 ( \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2192 Mb )\n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's correct. So A is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc), B is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa), and C is Mb. Therefore, the entire formula is correct.\n\nI should also verify if the abbreviations are used correctly. O for monkey, R for chased with c (Hazel), M for donkey, Q for kicked with a (Alfred), and b is Lewis. Yes, that's all correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: the \"only if\" translation. Since \"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. So the inner part is correct. And the main \"if...then...\" is a straightforward implication.\n\nSo the final formula should be as above. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(\u2203x(Mx\u2227\u00acQxa)\u2192Mb)",

The structure seems to be \"Not all A did X only if not all A did Y.\" In logical terms, \"only if\" usually sets up a conditional where the consequent is necessary for the antecedent. So, the entire statement can be thought of as a conditional where the antecedent is \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" and the consequent is \"Not all humans kicked Hazel.\" Wait, no\u2014the wording is \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the whole \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" is the antecedent, and \"Not all humans kicked Hazel\" is the consequent. So the main structure is (Not all humans chased Lewis) \u2192 (Not all humans kicked Hazel).\n\nNow, translating \"Not all humans chased Lewis.\" \"Not all\" is equivalent to \"There exists at least one human who did not chase Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"All humans chased Lewis\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). So negating that gives \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). Alternatively, using the equivalence between \u00ac\u2200 and \u2203\u00ac, this becomes \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). Either form is acceptable, but I need to check which one fits better here. Since the original uses \"not all,\" either translation is possible, but perhaps the problem expects the direct negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nSimilarly, \"Not all humans kicked Hazel\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxc) or \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acQxc). Again, same consideration.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire implication would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxc). Alternatively, using the existential forms, \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acQxc). Both are logically equivalent due to the quantifier negation, so either is acceptable. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided, so maybe the first approach with the universal quantifier is better here because the abbreviations are for predicates that fit into the universal structure.\n\nWait, the abbreviations are N: [1] is a human, R: [1] chased [2], Q: [1] kicked [2]. So for \"all humans chased Lewis,\" it's \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). Therefore, \"not all\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). Similarly for the other part. Therefore, the implication is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxc).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the entire statement is correctly structured. Let me check again. The original sentence is \"Not all humans chased Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\" So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Therefore, the entire formula is (\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxc)).\n\nAlternatively, using the existential quantifiers, which might be more standard for \"not all,\" but either way, the formula would be equivalent. But since the problem says to use the abbreviations given, and the example uses the universal quantifier with implication (like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), perhaps the expected answer uses the negation of the universal quantifier rather than the existential. So I'll go with \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(...).\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Qxc). Let me check the syntax again. The quantifiers are \u2200 and \u2203, and the connectives are proper. The implication is between the two negated universals. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb)\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Qxc)",

The sentence is: \"A human saw Lewis and a monkey is hungry.\" The abbreviations given are N for being a human, P for saw, b for Lewis, O for being a monkey, and L for being hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The sentence has two main parts connected by \"and\": \"A human saw Lewis\" and \"a monkey is hungry.\" So, I should translate each part separately and then combine them with the logical conjunction \u2227.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"A human saw Lewis.\" The phrase \"A human\" suggests an existential quantifier because it's referring to at least one human. So, there exists some x such that x is a human (N) and x saw Lewis (P). Since Lewis is denoted by b, the saw relation would be Pxb. So the first part would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Pxb).\n\nNow the second part: \"a monkey is hungry.\" Similarly, \"a monkey\" indicates another existential quantifier. There exists some y such that y is a monkey (Oy) and y is hungry (Ly). So that's \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly).\n\nBut wait, the original sentence uses \"and\" to connect the two clauses. In logic, when two existential statements are connected by \"and,\" we need to make sure they are separate existential quantifiers. However, if we just combine them with \u2227, we need to have two separate existential quantifiers. So the entire formula would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Pxb) \u2227 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). \n\nWait, but sometimes people might mistakenly use the same variable for both, but since the two existentials are separate, different variables are needed. The variables x and y here are distinct, so that's correct. \n\nLet me check if there's any ambiguity. The original sentence says \"a human saw Lewis and a monkey is hungry.\" There's no implication that the human is the same as the monkey or anything else, so separate existentials are correct. \n\nTherefore, combining both parts with \u2227 and using separate existential quantifiers should be the correct formalization. \n\nSo the final formula should be: \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Pxb) \u2227 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). \n\nI need to make sure I'm using the abbreviations correctly. N is for human, P is saw, b is Lewis, O is monkey, L is hungry. Yes, that's all correct here. \n\nNo need for universal quantifiers here because the sentence is about the existence of a human and a monkey. Also, the connective is \u2227 as per the \"and\" in the sentence. \n\nI think that's it.

The sentence to formalize is: \"Not all humans are asleep if and only if every donkey chased Lewis.\" The abbreviations provided are N for \"is a human,\" J for \"is asleep,\" M for \"is a donkey,\" R for \"chased,\" and b for \"Lewis.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its two parts connected by the biconditional (if and only if). The left side is \"Not all humans are asleep,\" and the right side is \"every donkey chased Lewis.\"\n\nStarting with the left part: \"Not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). But since it's \"not all,\" I need to negate that. So it becomes \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), which means there exists at least one human who is not asleep. Both forms are equivalent, but I should check which is more appropriate here. Since the original uses \"not all,\" maybe keeping it as the negation of the universal quantifier is better.\n\nNow the right part: \"every donkey chased Lewis.\" That translates to \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxb). Because for every x, if x is a donkey (Mx), then x chased b (Lewis).\n\nThe main connective is the biconditional \u2194, so combining the two parts: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2194 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxb). \n\nWait, let me verify. The original sentence is \"Not all humans are asleep if and only if every donkey chased Lewis.\" So yes, the structure is [Not all H are A] \u2194 [All D chased L]. \n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations. N is for human, J is asleep, M is donkey, R is chased, and b is Lewis. So the variables and predicates are correctly applied.\n\nI should also ensure that the quantifiers are correctly scoped.

The sentence is \"Every monkey will attack.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, the abbreviations provided are O for \"[1] is a monkey\" and G for \"[1] will attack.\" So, O is a predicate that applies to a single argument (since it's [1]), and G is another predicate that also applies to a single argument. \n\nThe original sentence is a universal statement: \"Every monkey will attack.\" In predicate logic, universal statements are usually translated using the universal quantifier \u2200. The structure is something like \"For all x, if x is a monkey, then x will attack.\" \n\nSo breaking it down, \"Every monkey\" translates to \u2200x (Ox), and \"will attack\" would be Gx. But since it's a conditional statement (if it's a monkey, then it will attack), the correct structure is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Gx). \n\nLet me check if there are any other elements. The sentence doesn't mention any specific individuals or additional conditions, so it's straightforward. The quantifier applies to all x, and for each x, if O holds (monkey), then G must hold (attack). \n\nI need to make sure I'm using the right symbols. The universal quantifier is \u2200, the implication is \u2192, and the predicates are O and G. No need for conjunction or disjunction here. \n\nWait, is there any possibility of a different interpretation? Like, maybe \"every monkey will attack each other\"? But the original sentence is \"Every monkey will attack.\" The subject is each monkey individually attacking, not attacking other monkeys. Since G is \"[1] will attack,\" which is a single argument, it's just about each monkey performing the action. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Gx). That matches the example given, where \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) was used for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" Here, instead of Rxc (admirer towards Charlie), it's Gx (attack by x). \n\nI think that's it. Let me just verify again. The sentence says all monkeys will attack. So for every x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x will attack (Gx). Yes, that seems right. No need for existential quantifiers here.

The sentence to formalize is: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The abbreviations given are O for monkey, P for saw, b for Lewis, N for human, L for hungry, and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If A, then B\", where A is \"every monkey saw Lewis\" and B is \"no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" Let me break down each part.\n\nStarting with A: \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, O(x) means x is a monkey, and P(x, b) since b is Lewis. So, this part would translate to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow the tricky part is B: \"no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit confusing. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is saying that the condition of \"no humans are hungry\" holds only if \"Alfred saw Alfred.\" So, if we let \"no humans are hungry\" be \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx), then \"only if Alfred saw Alfred\" would mean that this condition implies that P(a, a).\n\nSo putting it together, B is \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Paa. Therefore, the entire implication would be A \u2192 B, which is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Paa)\n\nBut wait, let me check if I got the direction of the implication right. The original is \"no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The structure here is \"Q only if R,\" which translates to Q \u2192 R. Here, Q is \"no humans are hungry,\" which is \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx). So yes, it should be \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Paa.\n\nNow, combining both parts. The entire sentence is \"If A, then B,\" so we have the main connective as \u2192 between A and B. Therefore, the full formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Paa)\n\nBut let me make sure there are no quantifier issues. The part \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx) is equivalent to \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx), which might be another way to write it. However, the problem allows using any equivalent form, so both are acceptable. Since the user didn't specify, I can use either. The original uses \"no humans are hungry,\" which directly translates to \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx).\n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Paa)\n\nI should check if there are any parentheses issues.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. Let me start by understanding the structure of the sentence.\n\nThe sentence is: \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the main components. The overall structure is a conditional statement: If [A], then [B]. \n\n[A] is \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations given, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and R is \"[1] chased [2]\". So \"every monkey chased Hazel\" would translate to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc), since c is Hazel.\n\nNow, the consequent [B] is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is usually translated as P \u2192 Q. So here, the statement is saying that if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then it must be that no monkeys kicked Hazel. Let me confirm that understanding. \n\nOriginal: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So the \"only if\" connects two propositions. Let me denote:\n\nLet P be \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" (i.e., \u00acQ(a, c)), since Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\".\n\nLet Q be \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\", which would be \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)). Or equivalently, \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)).\n\nSo \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. Therefore, the consequent becomes \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x,c)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is:\n\nIf [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc)] then [\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x,c))].\n\nIn formal logic, that would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x,c)))\n\nBut let me check if there's any variable capture here. The antecedent has a \u2200x, and the consequent also has a \u2200x. But since the scope of the antecedent is only up to the \u2192, the x in the consequent is a new x. However, to avoid confusion, maybe we should use different variables for the quantifiers. Wait, in formal logic, variables are bound within their scope, so the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent are separate. However, it's better practice to use different variables for clarity, but the problem doesn't specify that we need to avoid that. Since the problem says to use the abbreviations provided and return a well-formed formula, it's acceptable as long as the formula is correct. However, maybe the second \u2200x could be written with a different variable, like \u2200y, but the problem doesn't require that. Let me check the example given. In the example, they used x in both parts. For instance, the example had \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So in the example, even if there are multiple quantifiers, they can reuse variables as long as they are bound. So it's acceptable here. Therefore, the formula as written is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: the translation of \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is indeed \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x,c)), which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x,c)). Both forms are correct, but since the example uses universal quantification for similar statements (like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), perhaps using the universal form is preferable here for consistency.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x,c)))\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't mix up any parts. The original sentence says \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So the \"only if\" means that the truth of \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" depends on \"no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then it must be that no monkeys kicked her. But if there are monkeys that did kick her, then Alfred must have kicked her. \n\nAnother way to think about \"only if\" is that the statement is equivalent to \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" Which is exactly the translation I did. \n\nTherefore, the entire implication is correct. Now, putting it all together using the abbreviations and symbols as per instructions. The formula uses the correct predicates and constants. \n\nI think that's it. Let me write it out properly with the symbols.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00acQxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this logic translation problem. The sentence is: \"Every donkey chased Lewis just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.\" The abbreviations given are M for donkey, R for chased, b for Lewis, O for monkey, and P for saw.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The phrase \"just in case\" usually translates to a biconditional (\u2194) in logic. So the structure is something like \"For all donkeys, they chased Lewis if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis.\" Wait, but \"every donkey chased Lewis\" is the part that's conditional on \"no monkeys saw Lewis.\" So the entire statement is saying that if there are no monkeys that saw Lewis, then every donkey chased Lewis, and vice versa? Hmm, maybe. Let me think again.\n\n\"Every donkey chased Lewis just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.\" So \"just in case\" here might be setting up a condition where the chasing happened because there were no monkeys around. But in logic, \"just in case\" is often used to mean \"if and only if.\" So the entire statement is a biconditional between two parts: the first part is \"every donkey chased Lewis\" and the second part is \"no monkeys saw Lewis.\"\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nLeft side of the biconditional: Every donkey chased Lewis. That would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb). Because for every x, if x is a donkey (Mx), then x chased b (Lewis).\n\nRight side: No monkeys saw Lewis. Which translates to \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pyb). Because there does not exist a y such that y is a monkey (Oy) and y saw Lewis (Pyb).\n\nPutting them together with \u2194: \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pyb).\n\nWait, but sometimes in logic, when you have a universal quantifier and an existential, you have to make sure the scope is correct. Let me check again. The right side is \"no monkeys saw Lewis,\" which is equivalent to \"for all y, if Oy then not Pyb.\" So alternatively, that could be written as \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acPyb). Which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pyb). Either form is acceptable, but perhaps using the universal quantifier is more straightforward here.\n\nSo maybe the right side is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acPyb). Then the entire formula would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb) \u2194 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acPyb). But which form is preferable? The problem didn't specify, so both are logically equivalent. However, perhaps the original instruction expects using the given abbreviations directly. Since P is [1] saw [2], then Pyb is y saw Lewis. So the negation would be \u00acPyb. So the \"no monkeys saw Lewis\" would be that for all monkeys, they didn't see Lewis. Hence \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acPyb). \n\nSo the entire biconditional is between \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb) and \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acPyb). Therefore, the formula is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb) \u2194 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acPyb). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the variables can be reused. Since x and y are dummy variables, maybe we can write \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb) \u2194 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb). That's acceptable too. So the final formula would look like:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb) \u2194 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb)\n\nBut I need to check if that's the correct interpretation. The original sentence says that every donkey chased Lewis exactly when no monkeys saw Lewis. So whenever there are no monkeys that saw Lewis, all donkeys chase him, and if all donkeys chase him, then there are no monkeys that saw him. That seems to be the biconditional.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The entire statement is a single biconditional where the antecedent is \"every donkey chased Lewis\" and the consequent is \"no monkeys saw Lewis.\" So yes, the structure is correct.\n\nNow, translating that into symbols. Using the abbreviations:\n\nM is [1] is a donkey, so Mx for x being a donkey.\n\nR is [1] chased [2], so Rxb means x chased b (Lewis).\n\nO is [1] is a monkey, so Oy for y being a monkey.\n\nP is [1] saw [2], so Pyb is y saw b (Lewis).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb) \u2194 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acPyb)\n\nSince variables are bound, we can use the same variable letter (like x) for both quantifiers because they're in different scopes. So it's acceptable to write:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxb) \u2194 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb)\n\nBut sometimes, for clarity, different variables are used, but since they're separate quantifiers, it's allowed. However, in formal logic, using the same variable in different quantifiers in the same formula is allowed because each quantifier binds its own variable. So the formula is correct either way.\n\nTherefore, the final formalization is:\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxb)\u2194\u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00acPxb)\n\nAlternatively, if the system requires distinct variables, maybe \u2200x...\u2200y..., but the problem doesn't specify that. Since the example uses x and c, and the abbreviations don't require specific variables, using x for both is acceptable. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxb)\u2194\u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00acPxb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is: \"If not all humans chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis.\" The abbreviations given are N for human, R for chased, b is Lewis, O for monkey, and P for saw.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into parts. The main structure is a conditional: \"If [A], then [B].\" So A is \"not all humans chased Lewis,\" and B is \"every monkey saw Lewis.\"\n\nStarting with part A: \"not all humans chased Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans chased Lewis\" would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb). Because for every x, if x is a human (Nx), then x chased Lewis (Rxb). But since it's \"not all,\" I need to negate that. So \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb). Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to express \"not all\" as \"there exists at least one human who did not chase Lewis,\" which would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). But which one is correct here? Well, the negation of a universal quantifier is an existential quantifier with the negated inner part. So \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) is equivalent to \u2203x \u00ac(Nx \u2192 Rxb). And since Nx \u2192 Rxb is equivalent to \u00acNx \u2228 Rxb, the negation would be Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb. So yes, \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) is equivalent to \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). Either form is acceptable, but maybe the original form is better here unless the problem requires converting it. Since the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax, I can use the negated universal directly.\n\nSo the antecedent of the conditional is \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb).\n\nNow part B: \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" That would be \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyb). For every y, if y is a monkey (Oy), then y saw Lewis (Pyb).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire conditional is \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyb). However, in predicate logic, it's standard to use variables like x and y, but sometimes they can be the same variable if it's not conflicting. Wait, in the antecedent, the variable is x, and in the consequent, it's y. Since they are bound variables, their names don't conflict. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the same variable, but since they are in different scopes, it's fine. So the formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)\n\nBut using different variables (like x and y) is also acceptable. However, in the example given, they used x in both parts. For instance, in the example, they had \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So maybe it's better to use different variables to avoid confusion. Let me check the example again. The example had \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" Translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they used x in both the antecedent and the consequent (if there was a conditional). But in this case, the antecedent and consequent are separate quantified statements. So the antecedent is about humans and Lewis, the consequent is about monkeys and Lewis. So variables can be different. However, in predicate logic, variables can be reused as long as they are bound correctly. So perhaps it's better to use x in both, but with different quantifiers. Wait, but in the antecedent, x is bound by \u2200x, and in the consequent, if we use \u2200x again, it's okay because each quantifier binds its own variable. But maybe using different variables is clearer, but the problem doesn't specify, so either way is acceptable. Let me check standard practice. Typically, when you have multiple quantifiers, you can use the same variable if they are in different scopes. So for example, \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2200x Q(x) is acceptable. So in this case, I can write the consequent as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb). So the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)\n\nBut maybe using different variables for clarity. For example, the antecedent uses x and the consequent uses y. But the example uses x in both parts. Let me check the example again. The example's formalization was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). The original sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So there's only one quantifier. But if there was a conditional with two quantifiers, like \"If every A is B, then every C is D,\" it would be \u2200x(Ax\u2192Bx) \u2192 \u2200y(Cy\u2192Dy). But since variables are bound, you can use x again. However, in the example given, they used x in both parts. For example, if the example had a conditional, maybe they would use x in both. But since the problem says to return a single well-formed formula, and variables are just bound variables, it's okay to reuse x. So I can proceed with that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)\n\nBut wait, maybe I should use different variables to avoid confusion. Let me think. Suppose in the antecedent, we have \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb), and in the consequent, \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyb). Then the entire formula would be \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyb). But since variables are dummy variables, it's equivalent. However, in the example, they used x in the universal quantifier. So maybe following the example's style, using x in both parts is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects to use different variables. For example, if the antecedent uses x and the consequent uses y. But since the problem doesn't specify, either is acceptable. However, in the example provided, they used a single variable x. Let me check again. The example's formalization was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if there was a conditional with two quantifiers, they would probably use x in both. For example, if the sentence was \"If every linguist admires Charlie, then every student is happy,\" then it would be \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) \u2192 \u2200x(Sx\u2192Hx). So same variable. Therefore, following that example, I can use x in both parts.\n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a problem with variable capture? No, because in the antecedent, the x is bound by the universal quantifier, and in the consequent, it's another universal quantifier. So each x is bound by its own quantifier. So it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, to make it clearer, perhaps using different variables. But since the problem says to return a single well-formed formula and doesn't specify variable names, either is correct. But given the example uses x, I think it's safe to proceed.\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb)\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the consequent to use a different variable. Let me check again. Suppose the sentence is \"If not all humans chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis.\" The antecedent is about humans, the consequent about monkeys. The variables in each quantifier are separate. So using x in both is okay. So the formula is as above.\n\nAnother thing to check: the translation of \"not all humans chased Lewis.\" As mentioned before, \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) is equivalent to \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax. Since the example uses the universal quantifier directly, I think using \u00ac\u2200x(...) is acceptable here. So the antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb).\n\nSo the entire formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb)\n\nYes, that should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)",

Since K is a predicate that takes one argument (because it's [1] is happy), and b is a constant representing Lewis, the sentence should be straightforward. In predicate logic, when we say something about an individual, we apply the predicate to the constant.\n\nSo \"Lewis is happy\" would be K applied to b. That is, Kb. There's no need for quantifiers here because Lewis is a specific individual, not a variable. The sentence is a simple atomic formula. Let me check if there are any other elements I might be missing. The example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier because it's talking about every linguist, but this sentence is about a specific person. So quantifiers aren't needed here. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should just be Kb. Let me make sure the abbreviations are used correctly. K stands for \"is happy,\" and the subject is Lewis, which is represented by b. Yes, that seems right. No other connectives or symbols are necessary. The answer is simply Kb.\n</think>\n\nKb",

The sentence is: \"If Alfred ate, then every monkey is asleep only if every human saw Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B.\" So the overall form will be Ia \u2192 [something], since I is \"[1] ate\" and a is Alfred. Now, the consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if every human saw Hazel.\" \n\nThe phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is translated as P \u2192 Q. But here, the entire statement is about monkeys being asleep only if something. Let me think. The original part is \"every monkey is asleep only if every human saw Hazel.\" So maybe it's structured as: For all monkeys, if they are asleep, then every human saw Hazel. Wait, but the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" condition. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's that if every monkey is asleep, then every human saw Hazel. But the wording is \"every monkey is asleep only if every human saw Hazel.\" So \"only if\" here would mean that the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" is the antecedent and the \"every human saw Hazel\" is the consequent. Wait, no. Wait, \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So if we have \"Every monkey is asleep only if every human saw Hazel,\" then that would be: If every monkey is asleep, then every human saw Hazel. So the consequent of the main conditional (the \"then\" part) is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pyh), but wait, no. Let me parse it again.\n\nOriginal consequent: \"every monkey is asleep only if every human saw Hazel.\" Let me denote \"every monkey is asleep\" as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx). The \"only if\" part is \"every human saw Hazel,\" which is \u2200y (Ny \u2192 P y c), since c is Hazel. So the structure is: (every monkey is asleep) \u2192 (every human saw Hazel). Therefore, the consequent of the main conditional is [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)] \u2192 [\u2200y (Ny \u2192 P y c)]. \n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If Alfred ate (Ia), then [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 P y c)]. So the formalization would be Ia \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 P y c) ). \n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes it's better to structure it properly. Let me check if there's any scope issues. The main connective is the implication from Ia to the rest. The rest is an implication between two universal statements. So the formula is correct as written. \n\nLet me check the abbreviations again to make sure. I: [1] ate, so Ia is Alfred ate. O is [1] is a monkey. J is [1] is asleep. N is [1] is a human. P is [1] saw [2], and c is Hazel. So yes, Py c would be y saw Hazel. \n\nTherefore, the final formula should be: Ia \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 P y c) )\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, the order of variables and quantifiers matters. Let me make sure that the variables are correctly scoped. The first universal quantifier is over x (monkeys), the second over y (humans). Since they are in different quantifiers, the variables don't interfere. Also, the implication between the two universals is correct as per the \"only if\" translation.\n\nYes, this seems right. So the final translation is Ia \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Ny \u2192 P y c)) ). In standard syntax, written without parentheses around the quantifiers as needed. But since the arrow is right-associative? Well, to avoid ambiguity, it's better to parenthesize explicitly. So the formula is as above.\n</think>\n\nIa\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Jx)\u2192\u2200y(Ny\u2192Py c))",

The sentence is \"Every donkey kicked every donkey that kicked it.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"is a donkey\" and Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The main structure is \"Every donkey kicked every donkey that kicked it.\" So, for every donkey, if another donkey kicked it, then this donkey kicked that other donkey. Wait, actually, the sentence is saying that every donkey has kicked every donkey that kicked it. So, if a donkey was kicked by another donkey, then the first donkey kicked the second one.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's consider two donkeys, x and y. The phrase \"every donkey that kicked it\" refers to donkeys y such that y kicked x. The main part is \"Every donkey (x) kicked every donkey (y) that kicked it (x).\" So, for all x, if x is a donkey, then for all y, if y is a donkey and y kicked x, then x kicked y.\n\nSo, translating that into predicate logic. The outermost quantifier is \u2200x. Then, check if x is a donkey (Mx). Then for all y, if y is a donkey (My) and Qy x (since y kicked x), then Qx y (x kicked y). \n\nPutting it all together: \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ( (My \u2227 Qyx) \u2192 Qxy ) )\n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers and the structure are correct. The sentence says that every donkey (x) has kicked every donkey (y) that kicked it. So whenever y kicks x, x must kick y. Also, both x and y are donkeys. So the formalization should capture that for all x and y, if x and y are donkeys and y kicked x, then x kicked y. Wait, but the original sentence starts with \"Every donkey...\", so x is a donkey, and then for every donkey y that kicked x, x kicked y. So the structure is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ( (My \u2227 Qyx) \u2192 Qxy )). \n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check if there's any missing part. The original sentence doesn't mention anything about y being a donkey outside of the \"every donkey that kicked it\" part. Wait, the phrase \"every donkey that kicked it\" implies that y is a donkey. So the \"that kicked it\" is a relative clause modifying \"donkey,\" so y must be a donkey. So including My in the antecedent is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2200y ( (My \u2227 Qyx) \u2192 Qxy )). \n\nI should also check if the quantifiers can be rearranged. Since the scope of the second \u2200y is inside the implication of the first \u2200x, that's correct. Also, the parentheses need to be properly placed to ensure the implication applies correctly. \n\nYes, that should be the correct translation.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u2200y((My\u2227Qyx)\u2192Qxy))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The main structure is a conditional: \"If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the abbreviations. The given predicates and constants are:\n- P: [1] saw [2]\n- a: Alfred\n- b: Lewis\n- M: [1] is a donkey\n- Q: [1] kicked [2]\n- c: Hazel\n- O: [1] is a monkey\n\nThe sentence starts with a conditional: If Alfred doesn't see Lewis... So the antecedent is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis,\" which translates to \u00acPab. Because P is \"saw,\" with the first argument being the subject and the second the object. So Alfred (a) doesn't see (\u00acP) Lewis (b).\n\nThe consequent is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" Hmm, \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the structure is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" Let me rephrase that: The statement is that \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true only if \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is true. So the entire consequent would be (Not all donkeys kicked Hazel) \u2192 (Every monkey kicked Lewis). \n\nWait, but the original is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So the \"only if\" connects the two parts. So the structure is: (Not all donkeys kicked Hazel) only if (every monkey kicked Lewis). So translating that into logic, it's (Not all donkeys kicked Hazel) \u2192 (Every monkey kicked Lewis).\n\nNow, let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst, \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The negation of \"all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The standard way to express \"all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc). Because for every x, if x is a donkey (Mx), then x kicked Hazel (c). Therefore, the negation is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc). Alternatively, this can be written as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc), but in logic, the negation of a universal is an existential with the negated implication. However, since the original is \"not all...\", we can keep it as \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc).\n\nThen, \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\" That's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). For every x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x kicked Lewis (b).\n\nPutting that together, the consequent is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nSo the entire conditional is \u00acPab \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)].\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes it's better to make sure the structure is correct. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal sentence: If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then [not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis]. \n\nBreaking down the \"only if\" part: Let me recall that \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So in this case, A is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" and B is \"every monkey kicked Lewis\". Therefore, the consequent is A \u2192 B, which is as above.\n\nSo the entire formula is \u00acPab \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)).\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications associate to the right, so this is equivalent to \u00acPab \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)). However, to make it explicit, maybe parentheses are needed. But the user wants a well-formed formula, so the parentheses should be correctly placed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the consequent as \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). So the entire formula is \u00acPab \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)].\n\nBut another way to think about it: The \"only if\" is part of the consequent. So the main conditional is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Which is equivalent to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's what we have here.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other parts. The original sentence is: If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\nYes, so that's exactly what we translated. \n\nNow, let's make sure that all abbreviations are used correctly. The predicates:\n\n- P is \"[1] saw [2]\". So Pab is \"Alfred saw Lewis\".

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to translate is: \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"[1] is a monkey\", Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\", b for Lewis, P for \"[1] saw [2]\", and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its two parts connected by \"but\". The first part is \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" and the second part is \"it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\" Since \"but\" is logically equivalent to \"and\" in formal logic, I can treat them as two separate statements joined by a conjunction.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"all monkeys kicked Lewis\" would be expressed as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). The negation of this statement would be \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). However, I remember that the negation of a universal quantifier can be converted into an existential quantifier with a negated inner statement. So, \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) is equivalent to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). This means there exists at least one monkey who did not kick Lewis. So the first part of the formula would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb).\n\nNext, the second part: \"it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\" Using the abbreviation P for \"saw\", this would be \u00acPba. Because \"Lewis saw Alfred\" is Pba (since P is [1] saw [2], so the first argument is Lewis (b) and the second is Alfred (a)). The negation of that is simply \u00acPba.\n\nNow, combining both parts with a conjunction (since \"but\" is treated as \"and\"), the entire formula should be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb) \u2227 \u00acPba.\n\nLet me double-check each part to ensure correctness. For the first part, \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" correctly translates to the existence of a monkey who didn't kick Lewis. For the second part, the negation of \"Lewis saw Alfred\" is straightforward. The conjunction connects both parts as required by the original sentence structure. I don't see any issues with the abbreviations used or the logical structure here. So the final formula should be the conjunction of the two parts as derived.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox\u2227\u00acQxb)\u2227\u00acPba",

The sentence is \"Only donkeys ate and no humans will run.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence into two parts: \"Only donkeys ate\" and \"no humans will run.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Only donkeys ate.\" The word \"only\" here suggests that if something ate, then it must be a donkey. In other words, for all x, if x ate (I x), then x is a donkey (M x). So that part would be \u2200x(Ix \u2192 Mx).\n\nNext, the second part: \"no humans will run.\" This means that there does not exist any human who will run. So, for all x, if x is a human (N x), then it's not the case that x will run (\u00acF x). Alternatively, this can be phrased as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acFx). Another way is to use the negation of existence: \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Fx). Both approaches are valid, but maybe the universal quantifier is more straightforward here.\n\nNow, combining the two parts with a conjunction. The original sentence uses \"and,\" so we need to connect the two statements with \u2227. So the entire formula would be (\u2200x(Ix \u2192 Mx)) \u2227 (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acFx)).\n\nLet me check if there's any possible mistake here. For the first part, using \"only donkeys ate\" \u2013 yes, that's correctly translated by saying that anything that ate must be a donkey. For the second part, \"no humans will run\" is indeed the same as saying all humans won't run. Also, I need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly scoped. Each \u2200x applies to their respective implications. Since both are universal statements, combining them with \u2227 is correct.\n\nI don't see any other abbreviations used here. The given abbreviations are M, I, N, F. So M is for donkey, I for ate, N for human, F for will run. The variables are properly used.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Lewis is a donkey.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Lewis is a donkey.\" The word \"unless\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A unless B\" is usually translated as \"If not B, then A\". So here, \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Lewis is a donkey\" would mean that if Lewis is not a donkey, then no donkeys kicked Alfred. Alternatively, it could be phrased as \"Lewis is a donkey or no donkeys kicked Alfred.\" Wait, but the original sentence is a bit more complex.\n\nLet me think again. The original is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Lewis is a donkey.\" So the \"unless\" connects two propositions: the first part is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred,\" and the second is \"Lewis is a donkey.\" So, \"A unless B\" translates to \"If not B, then A.\" So here, if Lewis is not a donkey (~Mb), then it's true that no donkeys kicked Alfred. \n\nNow, how to express \"No donkeys kicked Alfred.\" That would be \"For all x, if x is a donkey, then x did not kick Alfred.\" Which is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa). Because M is [1] is a donkey, Q is [1] kicked [2], a is Alfred. So the negation of \"some donkey kicked Alfred\" is the universal statement that all donkeys don't kick Alfred.\n\nPutting it together, the entire statement would be: If Lewis is not a donkey, then for all x, if x is a donkey, then x didn't kick Alfred. So the formula would be \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa). \n\nAlternatively, since \"unless\" can sometimes be represented as a disjunction, like A \u2228 B. Let me check. \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" but with some nuances. However, in logic, \"A unless B\" is more accurately represented as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". So in this case, the original sentence is saying that either Lewis is a donkey (Mb) or no donkeys kicked Alfred (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa)). So that would be Mb \u2228 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa). \n\nBut which one is correct? Let me think. The original sentence says \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Lewis is a donkey.\" So, if Lewis is not a donkey, then there are no donkeys that kicked Alfred. So the implication is \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa). Alternatively, the disjunction would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa) \u2228 Mb. But in predicate logic, the order of the disjuncts doesn't matter since disjunction is commutative. However, when translating from English, the structure is more about the implication. \n\nBut maybe the correct approach is to use the implication. Let me verify with an example. Suppose we have \"I will go unless it rains.\" That translates to \"If it doesn't rain, then I will go.\" So similarly, here, if Lewis is not a donkey, then no donkeys kicked Alfred. Therefore, the formula is \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa). \n\nNow, I need to check if that's the correct formalization. Let's consider the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa) is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 Mb. Which would mean that if there exists a donkey that kicked Alfred, then Lewis is a donkey. That seems to make sense with the original sentence. Because if any donkey kicked Alfred, then Lewis must be a donkey. Which is another way of phrasing the original statement. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa). \n\nBut let me check if there's another way. The original sentence could also be read as \"If Lewis is not a donkey, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\" So yes, that's the same as the implication. So the formula is correct. Now, using the abbreviations given: M is [1] is a donkey, Q is [1] kicked [2], a is Alfred, b is Lewis. \n\nSo the final formula would be \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa). \n\nI need to write that in the standard syntax. So symbols would be: \u00acM b \u2192 \u2200x (M x \u2192 \u00acQ x a). Using the correct symbols for the connectives. The arrow is \u2192, the universal quantifier is \u2200, etc. So the formula is well-formed. \n\nAnother way to think: The statement \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Lewis is a donkey\" can be rephrased as \"All donkeys did not kick Alfred or Lewis is a donkey.\" Which would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa) \u2228 Mb. But in logic, disjunction with a universal statement. However, in classical logic, A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. So both forms are equivalent. But which one is preferable? The instructions say to return a single well-formed formula. Both are correct, but perhaps the implication form is more direct here. \n\nBut let me see if the disjunction form is acceptable. For example, if we have \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa) \u2228 Mb. But in predicate logic, the scope of the quantifier is important. Since the disjunction is between a universally quantified statement and a proposition. However, in standard logic, that's allowed. However, sometimes people prefer to have the quantifiers at the front. But in this case, since the disjunction is between two statements, one of which is universal and the other is a simple proposition, it's okay. \n\nBut are these two forms equivalent? Let's check. \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa) is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa) \u2228 Mb. Yes, because in propositional logic, A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. So if we have \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x..., that's equivalent to Mb \u2228 \u2200x... So both forms are correct. However, the example given in the problem uses an implication. For instance, the example was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So perhaps the expected answer is the implication form. \n\nBut in the case of the example, the sentence is a universal statement. Here, the original sentence has an \"unless,\" which introduces a disjunction. However, depending on how it's structured, the implication might be more straightforward. \n\nBut since both forms are logically equivalent, perhaps either is acceptable. However, considering the example given, which uses an implication for a universal statement, maybe the implication is the way to go here. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa). \n\nLet me just check for any possible mistakes. For example, could there be a case where Lewis is a donkey, but some donkeys kicked Alfred? According to the original sentence, \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Lewis is a donkey.\" So if Lewis is a donkey (Mb is true), then the \"unless\" condition is satisfied, so the \"no donkeys kicked Alfred\" part is not necessarily required. So in that case, it's possible that some donkeys did kick Alfred, as long as Lewis is a donkey. \n\nBut in the formalization \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa), if Mb is true, then the implication is automatically true regardless of the other part. So that allows for the possibility that when Mb is true, there might be donkeys that kicked Alfred. Which is correct. \n\nTherefore, the formalization is correct. So the answer should be \u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa).\n</think>\n\n\u00acMb \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa)",

There are two parts connected by \"or\": \"A monkey kicked Alfred\" and \"a monkey is hungry.\" \n\nFor the first part, \"A monkey kicked Alfred.\" The abbreviation O is for \"[1] is a monkey,\" and Q is \"[1] kicked [2].\" So, there exists some monkey (so \u2203x Ox) who kicked Alfred (which would be Qxa, since a is Alfred). So the first part would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxa). Wait, because it's \"a monkey kicked Alfred,\" which is an existential statement. There's at least one monkey that did the kicking.\n\nThen the second part: \"a monkey is hungry.\" The abbreviation L is \"[1] is hungry.\" So again, existential: \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Ly).

However, in predicate logic, the variables are bound locally, so even if both use x, it's still correct. But maybe the problem expects them to be separate. Let me check.\n\nThe original sentence says \"a monkey kicked Alfred or a monkey is hungry.\" The two existentials are separate. So the correct formalization would be the disjunction of two existential statements. So yes, (\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxa)) \u2228 (\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx)). But using the same variable is allowed here. However, sometimes people use different variables for clarity. But since the problem doesn't specify, either way is correct. Let's go with using different variables to be safe. So \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxa) \u2228 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Ly).\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxa) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). I need to make sure that the connectives and quantifiers are properly placed. Also, the \"or\" is a logical disjunction, so \u2228 between the two parts. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n(\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxa)) \u2228 (\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this logic problem. First, I need to parse the sentence carefully. The sentence is: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\"\n\nThe abbreviations given are:\n- M: [1] is a donkey\n- P: [1] saw [2]\n- c: Hazel\n- O: [1] is a monkey\n- R: [1] chased [2]\n- a: Alfred\n\nSo, breaking down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" and B is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" In logic, \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). So \"not all\" is the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc), since the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential with the negated inner part. But maybe it's better to stick with the direct negation unless we need to convert it later. But for the formalization, both are equivalent, but perhaps the original form is acceptable. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. Let me check: the abbreviations have M for donkey and P for saw, with c being Hazel. So \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nNow the consequent B: \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The \"only if\" is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, for every monkey, if they chased Hazel, then Alfred saw Alfred. Wait, but the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey chased Hazel\" part? Or is it that each monkey's chasing is conditional on Alfred seeing himself?\n\nLet me parse the sentence again: \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" So, the structure is: For all monkeys, (chased Hazel) only if (Alfred saw Alfred). Which would mean that for every monkey x, if x chased Hazel, then Alfred saw Alfred. Because the \"only if\" connects the action (chased) with the condition (Alfred saw Alfred). So the whole thing is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Rx c \u2192 P a a)). Wait, because \"chased Hazel\" is Rxc (since R is [1] chased [2], so x chased c (Hazel)), and \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is P a a (since P is [1] saw [2], so a saw a).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication is: \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 P a a))].\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any scope issues. The original sentence is a conditional where the antecedent is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" and the consequent is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\"\n\nSo yes, the consequent is a universal statement about monkeys, where each monkey's chasing of Hazel is conditional on Alfred seeing Alfred. Therefore, the formalization would be as above.\n\nNow, let me check if the abbreviations are used correctly. Mx for donkey, Pxc for x saw Hazel (since c is Hazel). Ox for monkey, Rxc for x chased Hazel. And P a a is Alfred saw Alfred. All correct.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 P a a))\n\nAlternatively, since the problem allows using standard symbols, I need to make sure that the quantifiers and connectives are properly formatted. Also, check if the parentheses are correctly placed.\n\nAnother thing to consider: The consequent is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The \"only if\" applies to the entire \"chased Hazel\" part for each monkey. So yes, for each monkey, if they chased Hazel, then the condition (Alfred saw Alfred) must hold. So the translation is correct.\n\nI think that's it. Let me write the formula again, making sure of the syntax:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 Paa))\n\nYes, since a is Alfred, so Paa is P(a,a). The abbreviations are case-sensitive? Well, according to the example, variables are lowercase, and constants are given as c and a. So P a a would be P(a,a). In the example, they used \"c\" as the constant, so here \"a\" is the constant for Alfred. Therefore, the correct notation is P a a.\n\nSo the final formula is as above. Let me check if there's any possible mistake. For example, is the \"only if\" correctly captured? The statement \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred\" can be rephrased as \"If a monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred saw Alfred.\" Which is indeed Rxc \u2192 Paa for each monkey x. And since it's for every monkey, we have \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 Paa)). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire implication is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox\u2192(Rxc\u2192Paa)).\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Rxc\u2192Paa))",

So the sentence is: \"If not all donkeys will run, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" And we have the abbreviations M for is a donkey, F for will run, Q for kicked, c is Hazel, and a is Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into parts. The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. Where A is \"not all donkeys will run\" and B is \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"not all donkeys will run.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys will run\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx), but since the original sentence uses \"not all,\" maybe it's better to stick with the negation of the universal quantifier here. So A is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx).\n\nNow B: \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" part can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, P is \"Hazel kicked Alfred\" which is Q(c, a), since Q is [1] kicked [2], so Qca. The Q part is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" Let's parse that. \"All donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x, c)). So \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc), which again could be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc). But again, sticking to the negation of the universal.\n\nSo putting B together: Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc). \n\nNow the entire sentence is A \u2192 B, so combining them:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc)).\n\nWait, but I need to check if there's any variable conflict here. The antecedent has x as a bound variable in the universal quantifier, and the consequent also has a universal quantifier with x. But since they're both bound in their respective scopes, it's okay. The variables are bound within their own quantifiers, so no conflict.\n\nLet me double-check. The main conditional is if not all donkeys run, then (if Hazel kicked Alfred, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel). So yes, that seems right. \n\nAnother thing to consider: Are there any other interpretations? For example, the \"only if\" part. Let me confirm that \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is indeed Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc). Yes, because \"only if\" introduces the consequent. So Hazel kicking Alfred (Qca) can only happen if the other condition holds, which is that not all donkeys kicked Hazel. So Qca implies that not all donkeys kicked Hazel. That's correct.\n\nSo the entire formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nI need to make sure that all abbreviations are correctly used. M is for donkey, F for will run, Q for kicked, c is Hazel, a is Alfred. Yes, that's all correct here.\n\nI think that's the right formalization. Let me check once more for syntax. The quantifiers are properly used, and the connectives are in the right places. The antecedent is a negated universal, leading to an implication where the consequent is another implication. Yes, that's a well-formed formula in predicate logic.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)\u2192(Qca\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc))",

The sentence to formalize is: \"Every monkey ate but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"[1] is a monkey\", I for \"[1] ate\", P for \"[1] saw [2]\", and c for \"Hazel\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The main structure is a conjunction of two parts: \"Every monkey ate\" and \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\". \n\nStarting with the first part, \"Every monkey ate\". In predicate logic, this would typically be a universal quantification. The universal quantifier \u2200x would be used here. The condition is that for all x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x ate (Ix). So that part would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Ix).\n\nNow the second part: \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\". Hazel is represented by the constant c. The phrase \"saw\" is P, which is a two-place predicate. So Hazel saw Hazel would be Pcc (since both the subject and object are c). The negation of this is \u00acPcc. \n\nPutting these two parts together with a conjunction (since the original sentence uses \"but\", which is logically equivalent to \"and\" in this context), the entire formula becomes \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2227 \u00acPcc.\n\nI should check if there are any other elements I might have missed.

The second part is a bit more complex: \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" That sounds like a double negation. \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Alfred isn't asleep.\" The abbreviation for \"is asleep\" is J, and Alfred is 'a'. So, \"Alfred isn't asleep\" would be \u00acJa. \n\nNext, the second part: \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" Let's break this down. \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" would be \u00acPbc, since P is \"[1] saw [2]\", Lewis is 'b', and Hazel is 'c'. Then, \"it is not the case that...\" would negate that, so \u00ac(\u00acPbc). But a double negation cancels out, so this simplifies to Pbc. \n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is a conjunction of the first part and the second part.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"A monkey is hungry and only donkeys are asleep.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence has two parts connected by \"and\": \"A monkey is hungry\" and \"only donkeys are asleep.\" So I need to handle each part separately and then combine them with the logical conjunction \u2227.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"A monkey is hungry.\" The abbreviation O stands for \"[1] is a monkey\" and L is \"[1] is hungry.\" The phrase \"A monkey is hungry\" is an existential statement. It means there exists at least one monkey that is hungry. So in predicate logic, that would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). Wait, but sometimes \"a\" can be ambiguous. However, in this case, since it's \"a monkey is hungry,\" it's likely existential. So \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) makes sense here.\n\nNow the second part: \"only donkeys are asleep.\" The abbreviation M is \"[1] is a donkey\" and J is \"[1] is asleep.\" The phrase \"only donkeys are asleep\" means that if something is asleep, then it must be a donkey. In other words, all things that are asleep are donkeys. So this would be a universal statement: \u2200x (Jx \u2192 Mx). Because for any x, if x is asleep (Jx), then x is a donkey (Mx). That ensures that only donkeys can be asleep; nothing else can be asleep.\n\nPutting both parts together with the conjunction \u2227, the entire formula should be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 \u2200x (Jx \u2192 Mx). Let me check if there's any overlap or variable conflict. Both parts use x as a variable, but since they are separate quantifiers, it's okay. The existential quantifier for the first part and the universal for the second. So combining them with \u2227 should work.\n\nWait, is there another way to interpret \"only donkeys are asleep\"? Sometimes \"only\" can be tricky. Let me think again. \"Only donkeys are asleep\" can be rephrased as \"If something is asleep, then it is a donkey,\" which is exactly what \u2200x (Jx \u2192 Mx) states. Alternatively, it could also be phrased as \"All donkeys are asleep and nothing else is,\" but that's not the case here. The original sentence says \"only donkeys are asleep,\" which doesn't necessarily mean all donkeys are asleep, just that if something is asleep, it must be a donkey. So the correct translation is indeed the universal statement.\n\nSo combining both parts, the final formula is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 \u2200x (Jx \u2192 Mx). Let me check the abbreviations again to make sure I used the right letters. Yes: O for monkey, L for hungry, M for donkey, J for asleep. Correct.\n\nI don't see any other possible interpretations here. The first part is existential, the second is universal. So the formalization should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox\u2227Lx)\u2227\u2200x(Jx\u2192Mx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The sentence to translate is: \"If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviations given are G for \"will attack\", a for Alfred, O for \"is a monkey\", R for \"chased\", c for Hazel, Q for \"kicked\", and b for Lewis.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If Alfred won't attack, then [some implication]. The antecedent is \"Alfred won't attack\", which translates to \u00acG(a), since G is \"will attack\" and a is Alfred. The negation here is because it's \"won't attack\".\n\nNow, the consequent is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is usually translated as P \u2192 Q. But here, the whole statement is about all monkeys. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe consequent is a conditional where the antecedent is \"every monkey chased Hazel\" and the consequent is \"every monkey kicked Lewis\". Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So \"only if\" here is connecting two universal statements. Let me think: \"Every monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So, if every monkey chased Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis. So that would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 R(x,c))) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x,b))). \n\nBut let me confirm. The \"only if\" in English often sets up a condition where the statement before the \"only if\" is the antecedent, and the one after is the consequent. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. But here, both A and B are universal statements. So the entire consequent of the main conditional is: If (every monkey chased Hazel) then (every monkey kicked Lewis). So that would be [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 R(x,c))] \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x,b))].\n\nPutting it all together, the main conditional is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 R(x,c))) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x,b))) ].\n\nWait, but sometimes in logic, when you have conditionals with quantifiers, you have to be careful about the scope. Let me check if there's another way to interpret it. The original sentence is \"If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So the \"only if\" is within the consequent of the main conditional. So the structure is: If \u00acG(a), then [for all monkeys x, R(x,c) only if for all monkeys y, Q(y,b)]. But \"only if\" here applies to each individual monkey's action? Or is it that the entire universal statement is the antecedent and consequent?\n\nHmm. Let me think again. Let's take the phrase \"every monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The \"only if\" here is connecting two universal statements. So the entire \"every monkey chased Hazel\" is the antecedent, and \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is the consequent. So it's a material implication between those two universal statements. Therefore, the consequent of the main conditional is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 R(x,c)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Q(y,b)).\n\nTherefore, the entire formula would be \u00acG(a) \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 R(x,c)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Q(y,b))]. \n\nAlternatively, could it be that for each monkey, if they chased Hazel, then they kicked Lewis? That would be \u2200x [(Ox \u2227 R(x,c)) \u2192 Q(x,b)]. But the original sentence says \"every monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So the \"only if\" here is not per-monkey but for the entire group. So if all monkeys chased Hazel, then all monkeys must have kicked Lewis. So the first interpretation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 R(x,c)) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x,b))]. \n\nI can also check if variables need to be renamed to avoid confusion. Since in the implication, both antecedent and consequent use \u2200x, but in logic, the variable is bound, so it's okay. So the final formula is:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 R(x,c))) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x,b))) )\n\nWhich uses the abbreviations correctly. Let me verify each part:\n\n- \u00acG(a): Alfred won't attack.\n- \u2200x (Ox \u2192 R(x,c)): Every monkey (Ox) chased Hazel (c).\n- \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Q(x,b)): Every monkey kicked Lewis (b).\n- The implication between those two universals is the \"only if\" part.\n- The whole thing is conditional on Alfred not attacking.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n\u00acG(a)\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192R(x,c))\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Q(x,b)))",

The sentence is \"No donkeys will attack just in case every human drank.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The phrase \"just in case\" usually translates to a biconditional (\u2194) in logic. So the whole statement is saying that the non-existence of donkeys attacking is equivalent to every human having drunk.\n\nBreaking it down: \"No donkeys will attack\" means there does not exist a donkey that will attack. Using the abbreviation M for being a donkey and G for will attack. So that part would be \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). \n\nThen, \"every human drank\" translates to all humans having drunk. The abbreviation N is for being a human and H is for drank. So that's \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Hy).\n\nPutting them together with the biconditional, the entire formula should be \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx) \u2194 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Hy). \n\nWait, but I need to make sure the variables are correctly scoped. The first part uses x and the second uses y, which is fine since they're separate quantifiers. Also, checking if \"just in case\" is indeed a biconditional. Yes, \"A just in case B\" is typically A \u2194 B. \n\nSo the final formula should be the biconditional between the two parts.

The sentence to translate is: \"Not all humans will run but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\" The abbreviations provided are N for \"is a human,\" F for \"will run,\" R for \"chased,\" and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"Not all humans will run.\" In predicate logic, \"Not all\" is equivalent to \"There exists at least one human who will not run.\" The standard way to express \"All humans will run\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Fx). So, negating that would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Fx), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acFx). So the first part should be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acFx).\n\nNext, the second part of the sentence is \"it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\" This is a double negative. The inner part is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel,\" which is \u00acR(c, c). The outer negation makes it \u00ac\u00acR(c, c), which simplifies to R(c, c). So the second part is simply Rcc.\n\nNow, the original sentence combines these two parts with \"but,\" which in logic is treated the same as \"and,\" so we use the conjunction symbol \u2227.

N is for human, F for will run, R for chased, and c is Hazel. The variables and quantifiers are correctly applied. The first part correctly negates the universal statement, and the second part correctly handles the double negative. The conjunction connects both parts as required. I don't see any mistakes here.

The sentence is: \"If Alfred ate, then a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" And I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: \"If Alfred ate, then [something].\" The \"something\" part is \"a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" So the entire statement is an implication where the antecedent is \"Alfred ate\" and the consequent is another conditional.\n\nLet me start with the antecedent. \"Alfred ate\" translates to Ia, since I is \"[1] ate\" and a is Alfred.\n\nNow the consequent is a bit more complex. It says \"a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" usually introduces a necessary condition. In logic, \"A only if B\" is translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the \"A\" part is \"a human chased Lewis,\" and the \"B\" part is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nSo the consequent would be: If there exists a human who chased Lewis, then it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nLet me formalize each part. \n\nFirst, \"a human chased Lewis\" would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), since N is \"[1] is a human\" and R is \"[1] chased [2]\", with b being Lewis.\n\nThen, \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is the negation of \"all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The universal statement \"all donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc), where Mx is \"[x] is a donkey\" and Qxc is \"[x] kicked Hazel.\" So the negation would be \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc). Alternatively, this can be written as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc) by moving the negation inside, but I think for the purpose of this translation, keeping it as \u00ac\u2200x... might be more straightforward unless there's a reason to convert it. But since the original uses \"not all,\" maybe it's better to stick with the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nPutting it all together, the consequent is (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc). \n\nSo the entire formula would be Ia \u2192 [ (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) ].\n\nWait, but let me check if I need to use different variables for the quantifiers to avoid confusion. The first \u2203x and the \u2200x in the negated part\u2014since they are in different scopes, using the same variable x is okay, but sometimes people use different letters for clarity. However, the problem doesn't specify that, and in formal logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers, so it's acceptable. So I think it's fine.\n\nLet me double-check the structure. The main implication is Ia \u2192 (P \u2192 Q), where P is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) and Q is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc). That should be correct.\n\nSo the final formula should be: Ia \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc)).\n\nI need to make sure that all abbreviations are correctly used. Let me check the abbreviations again:\n\n- I: [1] ate \u2192 Ia is correct for Alfred ate.\n- N: [1] is a human \u2192 Nx for x being human.\n- R: [1] chased [2] \u2192 Rxb where x is the chaser and b is Lewis.\n- M: [1] is a donkey \u2192 Mx.\n- Q: [1] kicked [2] \u2192 Qxc where x is the kicker and c is Hazel.\n\nYes, that all looks right. Also, the structure of the implications and the quantifiers seems correct. The \"only if\" correctly translates to the implication in the consequent. The negation of \"all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is properly represented as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc).\n\nI think that's it. Let me write the final formula.\n</think>\n\nIa\u2192(\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if a human is asleep\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a biconditional (if and only if). On the left side, it's \"Alfred didn't chase Hazel,\" and on the right side, it's \"a human is asleep.\"\n\nStarting with the left part: \"Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\" The abbreviation R is for \"[1] chased [2].\" So Alfred is the first argument, Hazel the second. Since it's \"didn't chase,\" that would be the negation of R. So \u00acR(a, c). Because a is Alfred and c is Hazel. Got that part.\n\nNow the right part: \"a human is asleep.\" The abbreviation N is \"[1] is a human\" and J is \"[1] is asleep.\" The phrase \"a human is asleep\" would require that there exists a human who is asleep. So that's an existential quantifier. \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Jx). Because we need there to exist some x that is both a human (Nx) and asleep (Jx). \n\nPutting it all together with the biconditional. The original sentence says the negation of R(a,c) is equivalent to the existence of such an x. So the entire formula should be \u00acR(a,c) \u2194 \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Jx). \n\nWait, but the biconditional connects the two sides. Let me check again. The left side is Alfred didn't chase Hazel: \u00acRac. The right side is \"a human is asleep,\" which is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Jx). So the entire formula is \u00acRac \u2194 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Jx). \n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the abbreviations correctly. The variables are properly quantified. The existential quantifier is necessary here because it's \"a human\" (there exists a human) who is asleep. If it were \"every human is asleep,\" it would be a universal quantifier, but here it's just the existence of one. \n\nSo I think that's right. The biconditional connects the negated R with the existential statement. Let me write it out: \u00acR(a, c) \u2194 \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 J(x)). Using the abbreviations correctly, and no extra symbols. The quantifier is \u2200 or \u2203, here it's \u2203. The connectives include \u2194 for if and only if, and \u2227 inside the existential. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. The formula should be well-formed. Let me just check the syntax again. The left side is a negated predicate, the right is an existential quantifier with a conjunction. The biconditional connects them. Yes, that should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRac\u2194\u2203x(Nx\u2227Jx)",

In predicate logic, when we say \"a donkey ate,\" it's an existential statement. So I should use the existential quantifier \u2203. \n\nThe structure would be something like \"There exists an x such that x is a donkey and x ate.\" Because both conditions need to be true for the same individual. So combining the predicates M(x) and I(x) with a conjunction. \n\nSo putting it all together: \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). That should capture the meaning that at least one donkey ate. Let me double-check. The existential quantifier is correct here because it's about the existence of a donkey that ate. The conjunction is necessary to link both predicates to the same x. If I used implication instead, like \u2203x (Mx \u2192 Ix), that would mean something different. Because implication would be true if there's an x where either Mx is false or Ix is true.

First, I need to parse the sentence carefully: \"If not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" \n\nThe abbreviations given are N for human, J for asleep, M for donkey, Q for kicked, c for Hazel, P for saw, and a for Alfred. \n\nLet me break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. \n\nA is \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"not all\" translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. So \"All humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Therefore, \"not all\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). But maybe I should stick with the direct negation unless required to simplify.\n\nThen the consequent is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. So the structure here is: If [C], then [D], where C is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" and D is \"Alfred saw Alfred.\"\n\nWait, let me rephrase the consequent. The phrase is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" So the entire \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is the antecedent of an implication where the consequent is \"Alfred saw Alfred.\" So the structure is: (Not all donkeys kicked Hazel) \u2192 (Alfred saw Alfred). \n\nSo putting it all together, the main conditional is: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) \u2192 Pa]. Wait, let me check each part.\n\nFirst, \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc). Then, \"only if Alfred saw Alfred\" means that this \u00ac\u2200... is the antecedent, and Pa is the consequent. So the consequent of the main implication is (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) \u2192 Pa).\n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) \u2192 Pa)\n\nBut maybe I need to check if the \"only if\" is correctly placed. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"If not all humans are asleep, then [not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred].\" The part in brackets is a statement where \"only if\" connects two propositions. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" and B is \"Alfred saw Alfred.\" Therefore, the consequent is (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc)) \u2192 Pa.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is as above. Now, I need to write this using the abbreviations correctly. The variables can be reused, but need to make sure they are distinct if necessary. Since x and y are different variables, that's okay. Also, check if the abbreviations are used correctly. \n\nSo N is for human, J for asleep, M for donkey, Q for kicked, c for Hazel, P for saw, and a for Alfred. The Alfred saw Alfred part is Pa, since P is [1] saw [2], so Pa would be P(a, a), which is correct. \n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qyc) \u2192 Pa)\n\nAlternatively, since variables are bound, maybe using the same variable letter is allowed as long as they are in different scopes. But using different variables (x and y) is better to avoid confusion. \n\nYes, this seems correct. Let me check again for any possible mistakes. The main conditional is correct. The translation of \"not all\" is handled by negating the universal quantifier. The \"only if\" is translated as an implication where the antecedent is the \"not all donkeys...\" part and the consequent is Pa. \n\nI think this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Qyc)\u2192Paa)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"Lewis is a donkey unless every donkey is happy\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is \"A unless B\", where A is \"Lewis is a donkey\" and B is \"every donkey is happy\". In logic, \"unless\" can be translated as \"if not B, then A\". So, if it's not the case that every donkey is happy, then Lewis is a donkey. Alternatively, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\", but I need to check which makes sense here.\n\nWait, the standard translation for \"A unless B\" is usually \"A \u2228 B\", but sometimes it's \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Let me think. For example, \"I'll go unless it rains\" can be seen as \"I'll go or it rains\" (I go \u2228 it rains), but also as \"If it doesn't rain, then I'll go\" (\u00acrains \u2192 go). These are logically equivalent. So both forms are acceptable. Which one is easier here?\n\nThe abbreviations given are M for [1] is a donkey, b is Lewis, and K is [1] is happy. \n\nSo, the sentence is M(b) unless \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nSo translating \"unless\" as \"\u2228\", it would be Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx). But let me check if that's correct. The original sentence says that Lewis is a donkey unless all donkeys are happy. So if all donkeys are happy (B), then Lewis doesn't have to be a donkey? Wait, no. The \"unless\" here is like an exception. So if not all donkeys are happy, then Lewis is a donkey. Which would be \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)) \u2192 Mb. Which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. But that's equivalent to A \u2228 B. \n\nSo both approaches should work. Let me check which form is expected. The example given in the problem uses implication. For instance, the example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So perhaps the expected answer here would use implication rather than disjunction. However, since \"unless\" is a bit ambiguous, but the two forms are equivalent.\n\nBut let's think again. The original sentence: Lewis is a donkey (Mb) unless every donkey is happy (\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)). So \"unless\" here is like saying \"Mb holds unless the other condition holds\". So the correct formalization would be that either Mb is true or \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) is true. Wait, no. Because if \"A unless B\" is A \u2228 B, then the sentence would be Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). However, intuitively, if every donkey is happy, then Lewis doesn't have to be a donkey. But if not every donkey is happy, then Lewis must be a donkey. Which would correspond to \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)) \u2192 Mb. Which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 Mb. But this is equivalent to Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) because in propositional logic, (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2228 B). So if we take \u00ac\u2200x... as A, then A \u2192 Mb is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 Mb, which would be \u2200x... \u2228 Mb. So both forms are equivalent. \n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Which one is preferable? The example uses implication with a universal quantifier. But here, using implication would require a conditional. Let me see. If I take the \"unless\" as \"if not B then A\", then the formula is \u00acB \u2192 A. Here, B is \"every donkey is happy\", which is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). So \u00acB is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). Therefore, the formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 Mb. \n\nAlternatively, using disjunction, it's Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). Which is also correct. However, sometimes in formal logic, using implication with quantifiers is more standard. But both are correct. However, the example given uses implication for a universal statement. So maybe the expected answer here is the implication form. \n\nBut which one is more direct? The original sentence is \"Lewis is a donkey unless every donkey is happy.\" So \"unless\" is a disjunction between the two propositions. So \"Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)\". But wait, that would mean that either Lewis is a donkey or every donkey is happy. But does that capture the original meaning? Let me think. If every donkey is happy, then the disjunction is true regardless of Lewis. If not every donkey is happy, then the disjunction requires Lewis to be a donkey. Which is exactly what the original sentence says. So yes, the disjunction works. \n\nAlternatively, the implication form would be \u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 Mb. Which is equivalent. \n\nWhich one is preferable? The example uses implication for a universal statement. But the example was a straightforward universal. Here, the structure is different. The example's sentence was a universal conditional. Here, the main connective is \"unless\". \n\nI think either form is acceptable, but perhaps the problem expects the implication form. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So that's a universal statement. The current problem's sentence is a disjunction. But since \"unless\" can be translated as a disjunction or an implication, but the example uses implication for a universal. However, the correct translation here is either \u00acB \u2192 A or A \u2228 B. \n\nBut the problem says to use the standard logical symbols. Both are standard. However, perhaps the answer expects the disjunction. Let me think again. The sentence is \"A unless B\", which is often rendered as \"A \u2228 B\". For example, in the example given, if the sentence was \"Lewis is a donkey or every donkey is happy\", then it would be Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). \n\nAlternatively, if the sentence is \"If not B, then A\", which is equivalent. \n\nBut since the problem says \"unless\" and not \"if not... then\", perhaps the more direct translation is the disjunction. However, I need to recall that in formal logic, \"A unless B\" is typically formalized as A \u2228 B. \n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose \"It will rain unless it is sunny.\" This would be \"Rain \u2228 Sunny\". Alternatively, \"If not sunny, then rain.\" Both are equivalent. \n\nSo in this case, the correct formalization would be Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). \n\nBut wait, let me check the meaning. The original sentence: Lewis is a donkey unless every donkey is happy. So if every donkey is happy, then Lewis is not necessarily a donkey. But if not every donkey is happy, then Lewis must be a donkey. \n\nThe disjunction Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) would mean that either Lewis is a donkey or all donkeys are happy. However, if all donkeys are happy, then the disjunction is true regardless of Lewis. If not all are happy, then the disjunction requires Lewis to be a donkey. Which matches the original meaning. \n\nAlternatively, if we use the implication form \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 Mb, that also captures the same. \n\nBut which one is considered more standard? In some logic textbooks, \"A unless B\" is translated as A \u2228 B. For example, in the book \"Language, Proof and Logic\", they might use that approach. \n\nGiven that the example uses implication for a universal statement, but here we have a disjunction. However, since the problem allows either, but requires to use the given abbreviations and return a single formula. \n\nBut perhaps the answer is supposed to use the implication. Let me think again. The original sentence can be rephrased as \"If it is not the case that every donkey is happy, then Lewis is a donkey.\" Which would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 Mb. \n\nAlternatively, since \"every donkey is happy\" is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx), then the negation of that is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx). So the implication could also be written as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx) \u2192 Mb. Which is equivalent. \n\nBut the problem says to use the given abbreviations. The abbreviations are M for donkey, K for happy. So the formula could be written either way. However, the problem may prefer to keep the original form with the universal quantifier. \n\nBut the question is to choose between \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 Mb or Mb \u2228 \u2200x(...). Since both are correct, but the example uses implication. However, the example was a straightforward universal statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the disjunction. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which is a universal statement. The translation uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So in this case, the problem is different. \n\nBut the user's instruction is to translate the given sentence. The key is to capture the meaning. Since both forms are logically equivalent, but the problem may prefer one. \n\nLooking at the example again: the example uses implication for a universal. In this case, if we use the disjunction, it's combining an atomic formula (Mb) with a universal. That's acceptable. So the formula would be Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the implication form, then \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 Mb. \n\nBut how to decide? Let me think about how \"unless\" is usually translated. In formal logic, \"A unless B\" is usually translated as A \u2228 B. For example, in the textbook \"Mathematical Logic\" by Ian Chiswell and Wilfrid Hodges, such translations are common. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). \n\nBut let me check once more. Let's take a simple case. Suppose the sentence is \"It is raining unless it is sunny.\" The formalization would be R \u2228 S. Similarly, here, the sentence is \"Lewis is a donkey unless every donkey is happy\", so Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). \n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct formalization is Mb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx).\n</think>\n\nMb \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx)",

The sentence to formalize is: \"If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" The abbreviations provided are N for human, J for asleep, O for monkey, R for chased, c for Hazel, and Q for kicked.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"not all humans are asleep\" and B is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be expressed using an existential quantifier: \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). Both are equivalent due to the negation of a universal quantifier. I'll need to decide which form to use. Since the original sentence uses \"not all,\" maybe keeping it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) is more direct, but both are correct. However, the problem says to use standard syntax, so I'll go with \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) for part A.\n\nNow for B: \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" part is important. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, for each monkey, if the monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Hazel. Let's break it down. For every monkey x (Ox), if x chased Hazel (Rxc), then Qcc (Hazel kicked Hazel). So B is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 Qcc)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is A \u2192 B. So the formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 Qcc))\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a better way to structure this. The \"only if\" part is crucial. Let me confirm: \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" means that for any monkey, if they chased Hazel, then Hazel must have kicked Hazel. So yes, that's \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 Qcc)). \n\nAnother thing to check: the antecedent is \"not all humans are asleep,\" which is correctly negated as \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). \n\nSo combining these, the entire implication is correct. Let me make sure there are no quantifier issues. The consequent has a universal quantifier over monkeys, which is fine. The antecedent is a negated universal, which is an existential. \n\nTherefore, the final formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 (Rxc \u2192 Qcc))\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again for any possible mistakes. The \"only if\" part is handled with implication in the right direction. The use of c (Hazel) is correct in Rxc and Qcc. The quantifiers are properly placed. Yes, this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Rxc\u2192Qcc))",

The main structure seems to be a conditional statement: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the phrasing here is a bit tricky. Let me break it down. The original sentence is \"If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\" \n\nBreaking it down, the first part is \"If a human chased Lewis\"\u2014this would translate to an existential statement, right? Because \"a human\" implies there exists at least one human. So that would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). Because N is human, x is the human, and they chased Lewis (b).\n\nThen the consequence part is \"then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit confusing. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is typically translated as P \u2192 Q. So here, \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is \u00acRcc (since Hazel is c, and she didn't chase herself). The \"only if\" part connects this to \"every monkey is asleep,\" which would be \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy). \n\nSo putting that together, the consequence part would be \u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy). \n\nSo the entire sentence is: If \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), then (\u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy)). \n\nPutting it all together, the formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy))\n\nBut wait, let me check if I got the \"only if\" part right. The original says \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\" So \"only if\" here is like saying that the only way for Hazel not to chase herself is if all monkeys are asleep. So that's equivalent to \u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy). Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that all abbreviations are used correctly. N is for human, R is for chased, b is Lewis, c is Hazel, O is monkey, J is asleep.

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the sentence is: \"If Alfred won't attack, then every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\"\n\nThe abbreviations provided are:\n- G: [1] will attack\n- a: Alfred\n- N: [1] is a human\n- J: [1] is asleep\n- R: [1] chased [2]\n- b: Lewis\n\nSo, the main structure here is a conditional statement. The antecedent is \"Alfred won't attack,\" and the consequent is \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Alfred won't attack.\" Using the abbreviations, \"Alfred will attack\" is G(a). Since it's \"won't attack,\" we need to negate that. So the antecedent is \u00acG(a).\n\nNow the consequent: \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" Let's parse that. The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, for every human, if they are asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n\nSo the consequent is a universal statement: For all x, if x is a human and x is asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis. Wait, but the original says \"every human is asleep only if...\" So maybe it's structured as: For all x, if x is a human, then (J(x) \u2192 \u00acR(b, b)).\n\nLet me check that. The \"only if\" applies to each human being asleep. So each instance of a human being asleep requires that Lewis didn't chase Lewis. Therefore, for every human x, Jx (x is asleep) only if \u00acRbb (Lewis didn't chase Lewis). So translating \"Jx only if \u00acRbb\" would be Jx \u2192 \u00acRbb. And since this applies to every human, we have \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acRbb)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u00acG(a), then \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acRbb)).\n\nSo in logical symbols, that would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acR(b, b)))\n\nWait, but R is [1] chased [2], so R(b, b) would be \"Lewis chased Lewis,\" and \u00acR(b, b) is \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" That seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check the structure. The main implication is from the antecedent (\u00acG(a)) to the consequent, which is a universal quantifier over humans. Inside, for each human x, if they are asleep, then the condition about Lewis. So yes, Nx is \"x is a human,\" so we need to make sure that we are only considering humans. Wait, the consequent says \"every human is asleep only if...\" So perhaps the structure is that for every human, if they are asleep, then the condition holds. But the way it's phrased is \"every human is asleep only if...\", which might mean that the entire statement \"every human is asleep\" is the antecedent of the \"only if.\" Wait, that's another possible interpretation.\n\nWait, sometimes \"only if\" can be confusing. Let's think again. The sentence is \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" Let me rephrase this. This is equivalent to saying that the only way for every human to be asleep is if Lewis didn't chase Lewis. So, if all humans are asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis. But that would be different from the previous approach.\n\nWait, there's a difference between \"For every human x, (Jx only if \u00acRbb)\" and \"(For every human x, Jx) only if \u00acRbb\". The first interpretation is that each human's being asleep depends on \u00acRbb, while the second is that the entire universal statement (all humans are asleep) depends on \u00acRbb.\n\nWhich is correct here? The original sentence is \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" The phrase \"only if\" here is modifying the entire \"every human is asleep\" clause. So it's saying that the entire condition (all humans are asleep) can only happen if Lewis didn't chase Lewis. Therefore, the correct translation would be: (For all x, Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00acRbb. Wait, but the structure is \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the original sentence is \"If Alfred won't attack, then [every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis].\" So the main structure is a conditional where the consequent is a statement involving \"only if.\"\n\nSo the consequent is \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" Which is equivalent to: If every human is asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis. Because \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if we take A as \"every human is asleep\" and B as \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis,\" then the consequent is A \u2192 B.\n\nSo then, the entire sentence would be: \u00acG(a) \u2192 [ (For all x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b) ]\n\nBut that would be different from my initial thought. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal sentence: \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" So \"every human is asleep\" is the A, and \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is B, so A only if B is A \u2192 B. Therefore, the consequent is (For all x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b). Wait, but Nx is \"[x] is a human\". Wait, actually, if we want to say \"every human is asleep,\" that's \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx). So yes, the consequent is (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b).\n\nBut then, how does that compare to my first interpretation where it's \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acR(b,b)))?\n\nThese are different. Let me see. Suppose we have two interpretations:\n\n1. \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acRbb)) which is equivalent to \u2200x ( (Nx \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u00acRbb )\n\n2. (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acRbb \n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nThe difference is whether each individual's being asleep requires \u00acRbb, or whether the entire collection of all humans being asleep requires \u00acRbb.\n\nThe original sentence says \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" The \"only if\" is attached to the entire \"every human is asleep\" clause. So it's saying that the only way for all humans to be asleep is if Lewis didn't chase Lewis. So if all are asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis. That would be the second interpretation. \n\nBut let's take an example. Suppose Lewis did chase Lewis (Rbb is true). Then, according to the second interpretation, if all humans are asleep, then \u00acRbb must be true, which it isn't. Therefore, it would be impossible for all humans to be asleep. But according to the first interpretation, for each human, if they are asleep, then \u00acRbb. So if even one human is asleep, then \u00acRbb must be true. So if there's at least one human who is asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis. \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The original sentence is ambiguous? Or is there a standard way to parse it?\n\nIn formal logic, when you have a universal statement modified by \"only if,\" it's usually the second case. For example, \"All A's are B only if C\" would typically be translated as (All A are B) \u2192 C. But I need to confirm.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the sentence was \"Every bird flies only if the sky is clear.\" The intended meaning could be either:\n\n1. For every bird, if it flies, then the sky is clear. (So each bird's flying requires clear sky.)\n\nOr \n\n2. If every bird flies, then the sky is clear. (So if all birds are flying, then the sky must be clear.)\n\nWhich is correct? The wording is ambiguous in English, but in logical terms, the placement of \"only if\" usually applies to the entire clause. For instance, \"All birds fly only if the sky is clear\" is more likely to mean that the entire condition of all birds flying depends on the sky being clear. But if it were intended to mean each bird's flying, it might be phrased as \"Every bird flies only if the sky is clear,\" which would align with the first interpretation.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the sentence is \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" The structure here is similar to the bird example. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that if every human is asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis. Therefore, the consequent is (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acRbb.\n\nBut then how does that fit into the overall sentence?\n\nThe entire sentence is: If Alfred won't attack, then [ (every human is asleep) only if (Lewis didn't chase Lewis) ]\n\nSo translating that, it would be \u00acG(a) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b) ]\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. So this would be a valid formula. However, sometimes people might parse it differently. Let me check another angle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original sentence is structured as \"If A, then for every human, Jx only if \u00acRbb.\" Which would be \u00acG(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acRbb)).\n\nWhich is the correct parsing? The original sentence is \"If Alfred won't attack, then every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" The placement of \"only if\" is after \"asleep,\" so it's modifying the entire \"every human is asleep\" part. So it's like saying \"Every human is asleep\" is the antecedent of the \"only if.\"\n\nBut maybe another way: The sentence can be read as \"If Alfred won't attack, then for every human, if they are asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" Which would be the first interpretation. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, in formal logic, when you have a universal quantifier and \"only if,\" it's often the case that \"only if\" applies to the entire universal statement. However, sometimes it's applied per individual. To resolve this, perhaps looking at the example provided in the problem's instructions would help. \n\nIn the example, the sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" The formalization was \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). That's straightforward. \n\nBut in our case, the problem is more complex. Let's think again about the structure. The sentence is: \"If Alfred won't attack, then [every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis].\"\n\nThe phrase \"only if\" introduces a necessary condition for the preceding clause. So \"every human is asleep\" can only be true if \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" So if \"every human is asleep\" is true, then \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" must be true. Therefore, the consequent is (every human is asleep) \u2192 (Lewis didn't chase Lewis). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be rephrased. Remember that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. However, in this case, the structure is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C), where A is \u00acG(a), B is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx), and C is \u00acR(b,b).\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as \u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00acR(b,b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)), but that's not necessary here.\n\nBut the problem is to write it in standard predicate logic syntax, so the correct way is to nest the implications.\n\nTherefore, the formalization would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b) )\n\nBut let me check if this is well-formed. The consequent is an implication between two formulas: the first is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx), the second is \u00acR(b,b). So yes, that's a valid formula.\n\nAlternatively, if the correct interpretation was the other way (per human), then the formula would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acR(b,b)))\n\nWhich is also valid. \n\nNow, which one is the correct interpretation? Given that the original sentence is \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis,\" I think the correct interpretation is the second one where the \"only if\" applies to each individual's being asleep. Wait, but why? Let me think of an example. Suppose there are two humans, Alice and Bob. If the sentence is \"Every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis,\" then if Lewis did chase Lewis, then it cannot be the case that every human is asleep. However, it could still be that some humans are asleep and others are not. But if the interpretation was per individual, then if Lewis chased Lewis, then no human can be asleep. Because for each human, if they are asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis. But since Lewis did chase Lewis, no human can be asleep. \n\nSo which interpretation is more plausible? The first interpretation (entire universal statement) would allow for some humans to be asleep as long as not all are asleep. The second interpretation (per individual) would require that if even one human is asleep, Lewis didn't chase Lewis. \n\nThe original sentence says \"every human is asleep only if...\" which suggests that the condition is necessary for the entire \"every human is asleep\" to hold. It doesn't necessarily impose a condition on each individual's being asleep. For example, if the sentence was \"Every student passed the exam only if the teacher was lenient,\" it would mean that if all students passed, then the teacher was lenient. It doesn't mean that each student's passing requires the teacher to be lenient. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is likely the first one: the entire universal statement is the antecedent of the \"only if.\" So the consequent of the main conditional is (forall x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acRbb.\n\nBut then, how to formalize this? Let's write it out:\n\nThe main formula is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [ (forall x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b) ]\n\nBut in predicate logic, that's acceptable. However, sometimes people prefer to rephrase implications with quantifiers. For example, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So the entire formula can be rewritten as (\u00acG(a) \u2227 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b). But the problem says to return a single well-formed formula in standard syntax, so either form is acceptable. However, since the original structure is an implication inside another implication, it's better to keep it as is unless there's a reason to change it.\n\nBut let me check the example given in the problem. The example sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" The formalization was \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the structure is universal quantifier with an implication. So in our case, if we take the consequent as (forall x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acRbb, then the entire formula is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [ ... ].\n\nBut the problem is that the consequent is an implication between two statements. So that's acceptable.\n\nHowever, another angle: maybe the original sentence is intended to have the \"only if\" apply per individual. For example, maybe it's saying that for each human, their being asleep requires that Lewis didn't chase Lewis. That would make the consequent \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acRbb)).\n\nBut which interpretation is correct? This is a classic ambiguity in English. To resolve this, perhaps looking at the wording. The phrase \"every human is asleep only if...\" uses \"every human is asleep\" as a single condition. The \"only if\" is attached to that entire condition. So it's more likely that the correct formalization is the one where the entire universal is the antecedent of the implication.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Let me think of another example. Suppose the sentence was \"Every student passed only if the exam was easy.\" This would mean that if every student passed, then the exam was easy. It doesn't mean that each student's passing depends on the exam being easy. So the correct formalization would be (\u2200x (Student(x) \u2192 Passed(x))) \u2192 Easy(exam). \n\nTherefore, applying this to our problem, the correct formalization of the consequent is (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b). Therefore, the entire formula is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u00acR(b,b) ].\n\nBut let me check if that makes sense with the original sentence. The original sentence is: If Alfred won't attack, then [every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis]. So if Alfred doesn't attack, then whenever all humans are asleep, Lewis must not have chased Lewis. \n\nYes, that seems plausible. \n\nHowever, another possible interpretation is that if Alfred doesn't attack, then for each human, their being asleep requires that Lewis didn't chase Lewis. Which would be \u00acG(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acR(b,b))). \n\nWhich one is correct? Given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects the second interpretation. Because sometimes \"only if\" can be parsed as applying to each instance. For example, in the sentence \"Every student who passed did so only if they studied,\" it would mean that for each student, if they passed, then they studied. Which is \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 Passed(x) \u2192 Studied(x)). \n\nIn that case, the original sentence \"every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acR(b,b))). \n\nSo this is really ambiguous. How to decide?\n\nPerhaps looking at the example given in the problem. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" \u2192 \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the structure is universal quantifier with an implication. If the original sentence had been \"Every human is asleep only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis,\" and if we take it as for every human, if they are asleep, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then it would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acR(b,b))). \n\nBut if it's taken as the entire universal statement being the antecedent, then it's different. \n\nGiven that the example uses a universal quantifier for \"every linguist,\" perhaps the intended interpretation here is that the \"only if\" applies per individual. Because the structure is similar to \"Every X is Y only if Z,\" which might be intended to mean for each X, if it is Y, then Z. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct formalization is \u00acG(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acR(b,b))).\n\nIn that case, the formula would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acR(b, b)))\n\nWhich can also be written with parentheses as needed.\n\nTherefore, considering the example and the possible parsing, I think this is the intended formalization.\n\nTo recap:\n\n- The antecedent is \u00acG(a).\n- The consequent is a universal quantifier over x, where for each x, if x is a human (Nx), then if x is asleep (Jx), then \u00acR(b,b).\n\nSo the final formula is \u00acG(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acR(b,b))).\n\nChecking the abbreviations again:\n\n- G: [1] will attack \u2192 G(a) is \"Alfred will attack.\"\n- a: Alfred\n- N: [1] is a human \u2192 Nx\n- J: [1] is asleep \u2192 Jx\n- R: [1] chased [2] \u2192 R(b,b) is \"Lewis chased Lewis\"\n- b: Lewis\n\nYes, this all matches.\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192(Jx\u2192\u00acRbb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is: \"If Alfred ate, then a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys will run.\" The abbreviations given are I, a, N, R, b, M, F. \n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If Alfred ate, then [some statement]. The consequent is a bit complex: \"a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys will run.\" \n\nBreaking down the consequent: \"a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys will run.\" In logic, \"only if\" translates to an implication where the condition is necessary. So \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. Wait, no, actually, \"only if\" is a bit tricky. Normally, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Because for A to happen, B must be true. So if someone says \"I will go to the party only if it's sunny,\" that means if I go, then it's sunny. So in this case, \"a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys will run\" would be: If there is a human who chased Lewis, then it is not the case that all donkeys will run. Wait, but the original sentence is \"a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys will run.\" So maybe the consequent is structured as (Human chased Lewis) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200 donkeys run). But the original sentence is \"If Alfred ate, then [this consequent].\" \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire sentence is: If I(a), then [ (N(x) \u2227 R(x,b)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200M(y) F(y) ]? Wait, but \"a human chased Lewis\" would be an existential quantifier. Because \"a human\" implies existence. So \"there exists a human who chased Lewis.\" So the consequent is: (\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x,b))) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 F(y)). \n\nWait, but \"not all donkeys will run\" is equivalent to \u00ac\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 F(y)), which is equivalent to \u2203y (M(y) \u2227 \u00acF(y)). But the translation of \"not all donkeys will run\" can be written either way. However, in formal logic, the standard way is to use the negation of a universal, so \u00ac\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 F(y)).\n\nSo the consequent is: If there exists a human who chased Lewis, then not all donkeys will run. So the entire implication is I(a) \u2192 [ (\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x,b))) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 F(y)) ].\n\nBut we can also rearrange implications. Since the main structure is If A, then (B \u2192 C), which is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. Let me check: A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is logically equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So maybe that's a better way to structure it. So the entire formula would be (I(a) \u2227 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy).\n\nBut let me confirm. The original sentence is: If Alfred ate, then [a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys will run]. As per \"only if\" being B \u2192 C, where B is \"a human chased Lewis\" and C is \"not all donkeys will run.\" So the structure is I(a) \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Which is equivalent to (I(a) \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So yes, that would be (I(a) \u2227 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy). \n\nNow, translating that into the formal logic with the given abbreviations. Let's write it out:\n\n\u2200x and \u2203x as needed. The final formula would be:\n\nIa \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy))\n\nBut according to the equivalence, we can also write it as:\n\n(Ia \u2227 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy)\n\nBut which form is correct? The original is \"If A, then (B \u2192 C)\". Both forms are equivalent, but perhaps the first is more direct. However, in predicate logic, it's acceptable to have nested implications. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" translated to \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So they used the implication directly. Therefore, following that structure, the correct formalization would be:\n\nIa \u2192 [ \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy) ]\n\nBut we need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly scoped. Let's check the parentheses. The inner part is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy). The entire thing is Ia \u2192 that. So the formula is:\n\nIa \u2192 ( \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy) )\n\nAlternatively, since implications can be nested, this is acceptable. However, sometimes people prefer to avoid nested implications if possible, but in this case, it's necessary because of the structure of the original sentence. \n\nAnother way to think: The consequent is \"a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys will run\", which is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy). Then the entire sentence is Ia \u2192 [that]. So the translation is correct.\n\nNow, making sure that all abbreviations are used correctly. The abbreviations are:\n\nI: [1] ate \u2192 Ia is \"Alfred ate\".\n\nN: [1] is a human \u2192 Nx for x is a human.\n\nR: [1] chased [2] \u2192 Rxb is x chased b (Lewis).\n\nb: Lewis.\n\nM: [1] is a donkey \u2192 My.\n\nF: [1] will run \u2192 Fy.\n\nSo yes, all abbreviations are correctly applied.\n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\nIa \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy))\n\nBut let's check the parentheses again. The inner implication is \u2203x(...) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(...). So the entire formula is:\n\nIa \u2192 ( \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Fy) )\n\nYes, that's correct. Alternatively, to make sure that the quantifiers are properly bound, but in this case, the variables are properly quantified. The x in \u2203x is bound, and the y in \u2200y is bound. So the formula is well-formed.\n</think>\n\nIa\u2192(\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Fy))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the sentence we need to translate is: \"If a human chased Hazel, then every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are N for human, R for chased, c for Hazel, O for monkey, J for asleep, and Q for kicked. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B.\" So A is \"a human chased Hazel,\" and B is \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"a human chased Hazel.\" The phrase \"a human\" suggests an existential quantifier here. So there exists some x such that x is a human (N(x)) and x chased Hazel (R(x, c)). Wait, but \"a human chased Hazel\" could be interpreted as there's at least one human who did the chasing. So that would be \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)).\n\nNow moving to B: \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" part is a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, the statement is that for every monkey, if it is asleep, then Hazel kicked Hazel. Wait, but the structure is \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" So the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" is the P, and \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" is Q. Wait, no. Let me think again. The phrase is \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" So, the \"only if\" connects the whole \"every monkey is asleep\" with \"Hazel kicked Hazel.\" So, that would mean that if every monkey is asleep, then Hazel must have kicked Hazel. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe it's structured as for each monkey, being asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel. So for all monkeys m, if m is asleep, then Q(c, c). \n\nWait, let's parse it again. The original sentence is \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" Let's think of it as: The condition that every monkey is asleep can only happen if Hazel kicked Hazel. So, if all monkeys are asleep, then Hazel kicked Hazel. So that would be (\u2200m (O(m) \u2192 J(m))) \u2192 Q(c, c). Wait, but the original is \"every monkey is asleep only if Q(c,c).\" So the entire statement \"every monkey is asleep\" is the antecedent of the \"only if.\" Therefore, the translation would be: If every monkey is asleep, then Hazel kicked Hazel. \n\nBut how to express \"every monkey is asleep\"? That would be \u2200y (O(y) \u2192 J(y)). So the \"only if\" part is \u2200y (O(y) \u2192 J(y)) \u2192 Q(c, c). \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire conditional is: If \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)), then [\u2200y (O(y) \u2192 J(y)) \u2192 Q(c, c)].\n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence is: If a human chased Hazel, then [every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel]. So the consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel,\" which is the implication that if every monkey is asleep, then Hazel kicked Hazel. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)) \u2192 [\u2200y (O(y) \u2192 J(y)) \u2192 Q(c, c)]\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can think of the consequent as \u2200y (O(y) \u2192 (J(y) \u2192 Q(c, c))). Wait, that might be another way to parse it. Let me see. If the structure is \"every monkey is asleep only if Q(c,c)\", perhaps it's for every monkey, if it is asleep, then Q(c,c). So that would be \u2200y ( (O(y) \u2227 J(y)) \u2192 Q(c,c) ). Which is equivalent to \u2200y (O(y) \u2192 (J(y) \u2192 Q(c,c))). \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The original sentence says \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" applies to each instance of being asleep. For example, if we say \"John will pass the class only if he studies,\" that translates to J \u2192 S. Similarly, if we have \"Every student will pass the class only if they study,\" that would be \u2200x (Student(x) \u2192 (Pass(x) \u2192 Study(x))). \n\nSo applying that here, \"every monkey is asleep only if Q(c,c)\" would mean that for every monkey, if it is asleep, then Q(c,c). Therefore, \u2200y (O(y) \u2192 (J(y) \u2192 Q(c,c))). Which can be rewritten as \u2200y ( (O(y) \u2227 J(y)) \u2192 Q(c,c) ). \n\nBut then, how does that interact with the \"only if\"? Let me think again. The original consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" So the \"only if\" is connecting the entire condition of every monkey being asleep with the kicking. But that might not be the case. Because \"every monkey is asleep\" is a universal statement. So the \"only if\" is saying that the entire universal statement can only be true if Hazel kicked herself. Which would mean that if all monkeys are asleep, then Q(c,c). \n\nSo which is correct? Let's take an example. Suppose we have \"All A's are B only if C.\" How to translate that? It could be interpreted in two ways. One way is that the entire statement \"All A's are B\" is true only if C is true. So (All A are B) \u2192 C. Another way is that for each A, if it is B, then C must hold. So \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 (B(x) \u2192 C)). \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? It depends on the scope of \"only if.\" In English, \"only if\" can sometimes be a bit ambiguous. However, in logical translations, typically \"only if\" is a material implication where the antecedent is the statement before \"only if\" and the consequent is after. So \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. \n\nIn this case, the P is \"every monkey is asleep,\" and Q is \"Hazel kicked Hazel.\" Therefore, the translation would be (forall y (O(y) \u2192 J(y))) \u2192 Q(c,c). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)) \u2192 [ (forall y (O(y) \u2192 J(y))) \u2192 Q(c,c) ]\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can also write implications with multiple quantifiers. So putting it all together, the main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. \n\nNow, let's check if there are any other considerations. For example, the use of variables. The first part uses x, and the second part uses y. Since they are bound variables, they can be different. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)) \u2192 ( \u2200y (O(y) \u2192 J(y)) \u2192 Q(c, c) )\n\nBut in standard predicate logic syntax, we can write this as:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u2200y(Oy \u2192 Jy) \u2192 Qcc)\n\nAssuming that the variables are properly quantified and the abbreviations are used correctly. \n\nLet me verify once more. The sentence is: If there exists a human who chased Hazel, then (if all monkeys are asleep, then Hazel kicked Hazel). \n\nYes, that seems to capture the meaning. If a human chased Hazel, then whenever all monkeys are asleep, it must be that Hazel kicked herself. \n\nSo I think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxc)\u2192(\u2200y(Oy\u2192Jy)\u2192Qcc)",

The sentence to formalize is: \"If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no donkeys ate.\" The abbreviations provided are N for human, L for hungry, P for saw, a for Alfred, M for donkey, and I for ate. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B.\" Here, A is \"no humans are hungry,\" and B is \"Alfred saw Alfred only if no donkeys ate.\" \n\nStarting with A: \"No humans are hungry.\" In predicate logic, \"no X are Y\" is typically translated as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). So that's straightforward. So A becomes \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx).\n\nNow, B is a bit more complex: \"Alfred saw Alfred only if no donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is the P, and \"no donkeys ate\" is Q. So B would be P(a,a) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Wait, \"no donkeys ate\" is equivalent to saying there does not exist a donkey that ate. So that's \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix), which can also be written as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Either form is acceptable, but I need to check which one fits better in the overall formula.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is A \u2192 B. So the whole formula would be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 (P(a,a) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nAlternatively, using the universal quantifier for the donkeys: \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix) is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). So another way to write B is P(a,a) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Which one should I use? The original instruction says to use the abbreviations provided. Both forms are valid, but perhaps the existential form is more direct here. But I need to make sure that the formula is well-formed.\n\nLet me check the structure again. The main implication is between the antecedent (no humans hungry) and the consequent (the \"only if\" part). The consequent is itself an implication: if Alfred saw Alfred, then no donkeys ate. So yes, the correct structure is:\n\n(\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) \u2192 (P(a,a) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nAlternatively, using the universal quantifier:\n\n(\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) \u2192 (P(a,a) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx))\n\nBoth are logically equivalent, but perhaps the problem expects one form over the other. Since the original sentence uses \"no donkeys ate,\" which directly corresponds to \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix), I think that's the more direct translation. So I'll go with that.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 (P(a,a) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nNow, checking for proper syntax. The quantifiers are correctly placed, and all variables are bound. There are no free variables here. The antecedent is a universal statement, the consequent is an implication where the antecedent is P(a,a) and the consequent is the negation of the existential. Looks good.\n\nI don't see any other abbreviations needed here. The constants are properly used (a for Alfred). The predicates are all correctly applied. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx)\u2192(Paa\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Ix))",

The abbreviations are N for \"[1] is a human\", P for \"[1] saw [2]\", and b for Lewis.\n\nFirst, the sentence is about Lewis performing an action (saw) on a human. So the structure is P(b, something). The \"something\" here is a human. Since it's \"a human\", that implies existence\u2014there exists at least one human that Lewis saw.\n\nSo I should start with an existential quantifier. There exists an x such that N(x) (x is a human) and P(b, x). Wait, but in the predicate P, the first argument is the subject doing the seeing. Since Lewis is the one seeing, that's our constant b. So the formula would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 P(bx)). Wait, but the syntax for predicates usually requires commas or just spaces? The example given uses Rxc, so probably just adjacent. So Pbx would be \"[b] saw [x]\".\n\nPutting it all together: \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Pbx). That should read \"There exists an x such that x is a human and Lewis saw x.\" Which correctly captures \"Lewis saw a human.\"\n\nLet me check if I need to use any other quantifiers. Since it's \"a human,\" not \"every human,\" existential is correct. Also, the conjunction here is necessary because we need both that x is human and that Lewis saw x. If I used implication instead, like \u2203x (Nx \u2192 Pbx), that would mean something different. Because implication is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So \u2203x (Nx \u2192 Pbx) would be true if there's some x where either x isn't human or Lewis saw x. But since we can choose any x, this would be vacuously true if there's any non-human x, which isn't what we want.

The sentence to formalize is \"Every monkey kicked Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"is a monkey,\" Q for \"kicked,\" b for Lewis, and M for \"is a donkey.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its two parts. The first part is \"Every monkey kicked Lewis,\" and the second part is \"Lewis isn't a donkey.\" I'll handle each part separately and then combine them appropriately.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Every monkey kicked Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"Every\" typically translates to a universal quantifier (\u2200). So, for all x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x kicked Lewis (Qxb, since b is Lewis). So that would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb).\n\nNow the second part: \"Lewis isn't a donkey.\" Since Lewis is represented by the constant b, and M is \"is a donkey,\" this would be \u00acMb. So we need to negate M applied to b.\n\nThe original sentence combines these two parts with \"and,\" which in logic is the conjunction symbol (\u2227). Therefore, the entire formula should be the conjunction of the two parts. So combining them, it would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u00acMb.\n\nI need to make sure that the syntax is correct. The universal quantifier applies to the implication, and the conjunction is outside connecting the two statements. Also, checking that the abbreviations are used correctly: O for monkey, Q for kicked with the arguments in order (kicker first, then kicked), and M for donkey. The constant b is correctly used for Lewis. \n\nNo quantifiers are needed for Lewis since he's a specific individual, so we use the constant b. The negation is correctly placed in front of Mb.

I need to translate the sentence \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred and Lewis didn't chase Hazel\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. It has two parts connected by \"and\": the first part is \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred,\" and the second is \"Lewis didn't chase Hazel.\" \n\nLooking at the abbreviations provided, R stands for \"[1] chased [2].\" So, for each part, I need to use R with the appropriate names. The names are given as c: Hazel, a: Alfred, and b: Lewis.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\" Hazel is [1], Alfred is [2]. So using R, that would be Rca. But since it's \"didn't chase,\" I need to negate that. So \u00acRca.\n\nThen the second part: \"Lewis didn't chase Hazel.\" Lewis is [1], Hazel is [2]. So that's Rbc. Again, negated, so \u00acRbc.\n\nThe two parts are connected by \"and,\" which in logic is the conjunction symbol \u2227. So combining them, it should be \u00acRca \u2227 \u00acRbc. \n\nWait, let me check the order. The abbreviation R is [1] chased [2], so the first argument is the chaser, the second is the chased. So Hazel (c) chased Alfred (a) would be Rca. Correct. Lewis (b) chased Hazel (c) is Rbc. So negating both gives \u00acRca and \u00acRbc. Then the conjunction of those two. \n\nI don't see any quantifiers here because the sentence is about specific individuals, not making a general statement about all or some. So no need for \u2200 or \u2203. \n\nSo putting it all together: the formalization should be \u00acRca \u2227 \u00acRbc. \n\nLet me double-check. Original sentence: Hazel didn't chase Alfred (so \u00acR(c,a)) and Lewis didn't chase Hazel (\u00acR(b,c)). Yes. So the final formula is the conjunction of those two negations.

        },
        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. The main structure is a conditional: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the first part of the implication: \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So \"not all\" would be the negation of that, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), which means there exists at least one human who is not asleep. Either form is correct, but maybe the first one is more direct here since the original sentence uses \"not all.\"\n\nNow, the second part is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is \u00acPab (since P is [1] saw [2], so Alfred (a) saw Lewis (b) would be Pab; the negation is \u00acPab). So \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if a human chased Hazel\" would be \u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rx c). Wait, because \"a human chased Hazel\" is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). So putting that together, the \"only if\" part is \u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc).\n\nSo the entire implication is: If [not all humans are asleep], then [\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc)]. \n\nPutting it all together, the main structure is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nBut let me check if there's a way to simplify or structure this properly. Also, in logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can write the entire thing as:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nAlternatively, since implications are right-associative, maybe that's okay. But to make it clear, perhaps it's better to parenthesize properly. Also, another way to write \"not all humans are asleep\" is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), which might be preferable because it's more direct in terms of existential quantifier. Let me see. So if I use \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) as the antecedent, then the whole formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ry c))\n\nI think that's acceptable. The variables can be different (x and y) to avoid confusion, but since they are bound by different quantifiers, it's okay. So the final formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ryc))\n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations given. Let me check the abbreviations again:\n\nN: [1] is a human\n\nJ: [1] is asleep\n\nP: [1] saw [2]\n\na: Alfred\n\nb: Lewis\n\nR: [1] chased [2]\n\nc: Hazel\n\nYes, so R is chased, so \"a human chased Hazel\" is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). \n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nAlternatively, using the existential form for the antecedent:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ryc))\n\nEither form is logically equivalent. Which one should I use? The original instruction says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are correct, but maybe the first version with the negated universal is closer to the original sentence's wording (\"not all humans are asleep\"), so perhaps that's better. Let me confirm: the original sentence says \"If not all humans are asleep...\", so \"not all\" is the negation of \"all\", which is \u00ac\u2200x(...). So using \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) is more direct here. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nBut I need to make sure that the variables are properly quantified. The antecedent uses x, and the consequent's consequent also uses x. However, since the x in the antecedent is bound by the existential (if we use \u2203x...), but if we use the negated universal, then x is bound in the antecedent. In the consequent, the \u2203x is a separate quantifier. So variables can reuse the same letter since they are in different scopes. So that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the existential form for the antecedent, then the formula would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ryc)). But again, variables can be reused. The problem doesn't specify variable names, so using x again is okay as long as they are bound.\n\nSo the final answer would be either:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nOr:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nWhich one is correct? Both are equivalent. Since the original sentence says \"not all\", using the negated universal might be more faithful. However, sometimes in logic, it's preferred to push the negation in, but the problem doesn't specify. The example given uses the universal form, so maybe following that style is better. For example, the example used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So here, using the negation of the universal would be consistent with that style.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct formalization is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nBut let me check the \"only if\" part again. The original says \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\" So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" (\u00acPab), so the implication is \u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). So that part is correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication is: If \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx), then (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203x...). So that's the structure. \n\nI think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acPab\u2192\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"No humans kicked a human.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. The abbreviations are N for \"[1] is a human\" and Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\". \n\nFirst, \"No humans kicked a human.\" So, this is a universal negative statement. In English, \"No A are B\" translates to \"For all x, if A(x), then not B(x)\", but here it's a bit more complex because it's about actions. Wait, the structure here is that there doesn't exist any human who kicked another human. \n\nSo maybe I should think of it as the negation of an existential statement. The original statement is equivalent to saying \"It is not the case that there exists a human x such that x kicked some human y.\" \n\nBreaking that down: The existential quantifier \u2203x and \u2203y? Wait, but the action involves two humans. So for some human x, and some human y, x kicked y. Therefore, the negation of that would be \u00ac\u2203x\u2203y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2227 Qxy). Wait, but maybe it's better phrased as \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Qxy)). Or maybe even more simply, for all x and y, if x is a human and y is a human, then x did not kick y. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: \"No humans kicked a human\" can be read as \"For every human x, x did not kick any human y.\" Which would translate to \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). \n\nBut which is the correct way? Let me recall the standard translations. The statement \"No A's are B's\" is \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 \u00acB(x)). But here, the situation is different because we're dealing with a relation between two entities. \n\nThe original sentence is about there not existing any instance where a human kicked another. So the existential quantifier over the action. Therefore, the negation of \u2203x\u2203y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2227 Qxy). So the formalization would be \u00ac\u2203x\u2203y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2227 Qxy). \n\nAlternatively, using universal quantifiers: For all x and y, if x is a human and y is a human, then x did not kick y. Which would be \u2200x\u2200y ((Nx \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nAre these two equivalent? In classical logic, yes. The negation of an existential statement is a universal statement. So both forms are equivalent. \n\nNow, which one to choose? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations are N and Q. Let me check if there are any constraints. The example given used universal quantification with implication. Maybe the expected answer is using universal quantifiers. \n\nBut let me think again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which became \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). Similarly, here, if we think of \"No humans kicked a human\" as \"For all humans x, for all humans y, x did not kick y\", then it's \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2192 (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). Which can be written as \u2200x\u2200y ((Nx \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nAlternatively, using the scope of the quantifiers: \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). \n\nBut in predicate logic, the placement of quantifiers is important. Let me check. If I write \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2192 (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)), this is equivalent to \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nYes, because (A \u2192 (B \u2192 C)) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B \u2192 C). So both forms are acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, the other approach with the negation of the existential: \u00ac\u2203x\u2203y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2227 Qxy). Which is also correct. \n\nBut which one is considered more standard? The example uses a universal quantifier with implication, so perhaps the same approach is expected here. Also, the sentence \"No humans kicked a human\" can be read as \"For every human x, there does not exist a human y such that x kicked y.\" Which would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Qxy)). Which would then be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). \n\nSo perhaps the answer is \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nAlternatively, the double universal quantifier approach. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the formalization is correct. Let me think of possible interpretations. Suppose there's a world where there are humans but no kicking. Both forms would hold. If there's a case where a human kicked another, then the existential would be true, so its negation is false. The universal would also be false. \n\nSo both forms are equivalent. Now, the question is about which one to choose. The example uses a single universal quantifier and an implication. But here, since the statement involves two humans, perhaps two universal quantifiers are needed. \n\nSo the correct formalization would be \u2200x\u2200y ( (Nx \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy ). \n\nAlternatively, maybe \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). Which is the same thing. \n\nIn terms of syntax, the answer should be written with the quantifiers first. But in standard predicate logic, both are acceptable. However, the example uses the form with a single quantifier and then implication. But perhaps here, since the antecedent of the implication involves two conditions (Nx and Ny), it's better to have both quantifiers at the front. \n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Either way is correct. Let me check standard translations. \n\nThe standard way to translate \"No A's R B's\" where R is a relation would be \u2200x\u2200y (A(x) \u2227 B(y) \u2192 \u00acR(x,y)). \n\nIn this case, A and B are both N (human). So \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nAlternatively, if it's \"No A's R any B's\", which would be \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 \u2200y (B(y) \u2192 \u00acR(x,y))). \n\nWhich is equivalent. \n\nSo both are correct. But the example uses a single quantifier. However, since the example had a one-place predicate (Lx) leading to Rxc, here we have two one-place predicates leading to Qxy. \n\nBut perhaps the answer expects the universal quantification over both x and y. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is written as \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). \n\nBut in terms of the example given, the example uses a single universal quantifier. However, in this case, the statement involves two entities. \n\nBut how is the example structured? The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So for all x, if x is a linguist, then x admires Charlie. Which is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). \n\nIn the current problem, the statement is about no human kicked a human. So for all x, if x is a human, then it is not the case that x kicked some human y. Which would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Qxy)). Which is equivalent to \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy)). \n\nAlternatively, \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nWhich one is preferable? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations for Q are [1] kicked [2]. So Qxy is x kicked y. \n\nSo the answer could be written as \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nAlternatively, using nested quantifiers. \n\nBut perhaps the answer is expected to use two universal quantifiers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is written as \u00ac\u2203x\u2203y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2227 Qxy). \n\nBut which one is correct? Both are logically equivalent. \n\nBut perhaps the problem expects one particular form. Let me think about how similar examples are usually presented. \n\nIn logic textbooks, \"No A are B\" is translated as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 \u00acB(x)), but when dealing with relations, \"No A's R B's\" would be \u2200x\u2200y (A(x) \u2227 B(y) \u2192 \u00acR(x,y)). \n\nAlternatively, if the relation is between A's and B's, then that's the way. \n\nIn this case, since both the subject and the object are humans, it's \"No human kicked a human\", which would be \u2200x\u2200y (Human(x) \u2227 Human(y) \u2192 \u00acKicked(x,y)). \n\nSo that would translate to \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nAlternatively, if there's a possibility that there are non-human entities that could have been kicked, but the statement is only about humans not kicking humans. In that case, the universal quantifiers would range over all entities, and we need to specify that x and y are humans. \n\nAssuming that the domain is not restricted, and Nx means x is a human, then the correct formalization would indeed be \u2200x\u2200y ((Nx \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nTherefore, the answer is \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nBut let me check again. Suppose there is a human x and a human y, and x kicked y. Then the implication would be false. So the entire statement would be false. Which matches the original sentence. If there are no such x and y, then the statement is true. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, using the negation of the existential: \u00ac\u2203x\u2203y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2227 Qxy). \n\nBut which is the better answer? The example used a universal statement, so maybe the same approach here. Also, the problem says \"No humans kicked a human\", which is a universal statement. \n\nBut both forms are correct. However, perhaps the answer expects the universal form. \n\nIn the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" uses a universal quantifier. Similarly, \"No humans...\" can be expressed with a universal quantifier. \n\nBut since the relation involves two entities, we need two quantifiers. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \u2200x\u2200y ((Nx \u2227 Ny) \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nSo written in the required syntax, it would be \u2200x\u2200y(Nx\u2227Ny\u2192\u00acQxy). \n\nAlternatively, using parentheses properly. \n\nYes, the formula should be \u2200x\u2200y (Nx \u2227 Ny \u2192 \u00acQxy). \n\nSo the final answer is \u2200x\u2200y(Nx\u2227Ny\u2192\u00acQxy).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x\u2200y(Nx\u2227Ny\u2192\u00acQxy)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So the sentence is: \"If every monkey is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" And we need to translate it into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure seems to be a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Hmm, I need to be careful with the phrasing here. The phrase \"only if\" can sometimes be tricky. Let me recall that in logic, \"P only if Q\" is usually translated as P \u2192 Q. So, the entire sentence is structured as: If (every monkey is asleep), then (Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry). \n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe antecedent is \"every monkey is asleep.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and J is \"[1] is asleep.\" So, \"every monkey is asleep\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx).\n\nThe consequent is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\" Let's parse this part. Let me rephrase: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" only if \"every monkey is hungry.\" Using the \"P only if Q\" structure again, this would translate to \u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 (every monkey is hungry). Wait, Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\", so Alfred didn't kick Hazel is \u00acQ(a, c). The \"only if\" part would then make it \u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 [every monkey is hungry]. \n\nBut \"every monkey is hungry\" uses L, which is \"[1] is hungry.\" So that's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx), then [\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)].\n\nIn logical terms, that would be: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)).\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, we need to make sure the quantifiers are properly scoped. Let me check if there are any variables that need to be bound. The first part is a universal quantifier over x for monkeys being asleep. The consequent has another universal quantifier over x for monkeys being hungry. Since the variables are both x, but they are in different scopes, it's okay. Alternatively, we could use different variables, but since they are in separate parts of the implication, using the same variable is acceptable as long as the scopes are clear.\n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx))\n\nBut maybe to make it more standard, we can write it with parentheses properly. Also, remember that implication is right-associative, but to avoid confusion, parentheses can be added. However, according to standard syntax, the formula is correct as written.\n\nWait, another way to look at the original sentence: \"If A, then (B only if C)\" is equivalent to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So substituting, A is \u2200x (Ox\u2192Jx), B is \u00acQ(a,c), and C is \u2200x (Ox\u2192Lx). Therefore, the translation is correct.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx))\n\nUsing the abbreviations given, and making sure that the variables are properly quantified. Also, note that Q(a, c) is written as Qac in the example format. So the formula is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If not all humans are asleep, then [some statement].\" The antecedent is \"not all humans are asleep,\" and the consequent is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), which means there exists at least one human who is not asleep. Either form is acceptable, but maybe the problem expects the direct negation of the universal statement, so I'll go with \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx).\n\nNow the consequent: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" only if \"no humans are hungry.\" Let's parse this.\n\nLet me rephrase the consequent as: If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no humans are hungry. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"P only if Q\" which is P \u2192 Q. Here, P is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel,\" and Q is \"no humans are hungry.\" So the consequent would be (\u00acQac) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)). Wait, let me check the abbreviations again.\n\nAbbreviations:\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\na: Alfred\nc: Hazel\nSo \"Alfred kicked Hazel\" is Qac. Therefore, \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" is \u00acQac.\n\nThe \"only if\" part: \"only if no humans are hungry.\" The \"no humans are hungry\" is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx), since N is human and L is hungry. Alternatively, \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Either way, but the former might be more direct here.\n\nSo putting the consequent together: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry\" becomes \u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx). Wait, but \"only if\" is the other way around. Wait, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So here, A is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" (\u00acQac), and B is \"no humans are hungry\" (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)). So the consequent is \u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx).\n\nBut let me check again. The original consequent is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" So, if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then it must be that no humans are hungry. So yes, that's \u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx).\n\nAlternatively, \"no humans are hungry\" can be written as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx), which is equivalent. But for consistency, maybe the problem expects one form or the other. Let's stick with the negation of the existential quantifier here.\n\nPutting it all together: The entire sentence is \"If [antecedent], then [consequent].\" So:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx))\n\nBut maybe we can simplify or rephrase. Also, the consequent is a conditional, so the entire formula is a material implication with the antecedent being the negation of the universal and the consequent being that implication.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire formula as:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nBut since \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) is equivalent to \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx), both are acceptable. Let me check which is preferable. The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Since L is \"[1] is hungry,\" and N is \"[1] is a human,\" the \"no humans are hungry\" is indeed the negation of \"there exists a human who is hungry,\" which is \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the full formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can write the consequent as \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx), which is equivalent.\n\nBut to stick with the negation of the existential, perhaps the former is better. Let me check for correctness.\n\nAnother way to approach the entire translation is to consider the structure:\n\nOriginal sentence: If not all humans are asleep, then (Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry).\n\nBreaking down the \"only if\" part again. Let me think of it as a material implication. So, the consequent is \"if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no humans are hungry.\" So the entire formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx))\n\nYes, that's correct. Now, I need to present this in standard predicate logic syntax. Also, note that in the antecedent, we have \u00ac\u2200x(...), and in the consequent, another implication.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx))\n\nAlternatively, we can use the equivalence between \u00ac\u2203x(P) and \u2200x(\u00acP), but I think the way I have it is acceptable.\n\nLet me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, could the \"only if\" have been misinterpreted? Suppose the original was \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" So, \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. That is, for Alfred not kicking Hazel to be true, it is necessary that no humans are hungry. Which is equivalent to: If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no humans are hungry. So the translation is correct.\n\nAnother possible point of confusion: The main conditional is \"If not all humans are asleep, then [consequent].\" So the entire formula is a conditional with the antecedent being \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) and the consequent being the implication \u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(...). So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Nx\u2227Lx))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given sentence and break it down into its logical components. The sentence is: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then every monkey is asleep only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The abbreviations provided are R for \"chased\", c for Hazel, O for \"is a monkey\", J for \"is asleep\", and Q for \"kicked\".\n\nStarting with the first part: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel...\" Using the abbreviation R, which is [1] chased [2], since Hazel is both the subject and object here, this would translate to \u00acR(c, c). So the antecedent of the conditional is \u00acR(c, c).\n\nNow the consequent: \"every monkey is asleep only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The structure here is \"every monkey is asleep only if [condition]\". In logic, \"only if\" usually introduces a necessary condition. So, for every monkey, if it is asleep, then the condition must hold. The condition here is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\". \n\nBreaking that down further: \"every monkey is asleep only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" can be rephrased as \"For all x, if x is a monkey and x is asleep, then it is not the case that there exists a monkey y who kicked Hazel.\" Wait, no. Let me think again. The \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" part is a universal statement. \"No monkeys kicked Hazel\" would be equivalent to \"For all y, if y is a monkey, then y did not kick Hazel.\" So using abbreviation Q, which is [1] kicked [2], we can write that as \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c)).\n\nPutting this together, the consequent is: For every x, if x is a monkey and x is asleep, then (for all y, if y is a monkey, then y did not kick Hazel). Wait, but the original says \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" So maybe it's better phrased as: If every monkey is asleep, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. Wait, no. The structure is \"every monkey is asleep only if [no monkeys kicked Hazel]\". So the \"only if\" here applies to each individual monkey's being asleep. That is, for each monkey, if it is asleep, then the condition (no monkeys kicked Hazel) must hold. Because \"only if\" is a per-instance condition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" is the antecedent of the \"only if\". Let me recall that \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But when the \"A\" is a universal statement. Wait, the original is \"every monkey is asleep only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\". So the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" is the A, and \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is the B. So this would translate to (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c))). But that might not be correct because \"only if\" in this case is connecting the entire universal statement with the condition. However, another interpretation could be that for each monkey, being asleep requires that no monkeys kicked Hazel. Which would be \u2200x [(Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c))]. But that seems a bit odd because if one monkey is asleep, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. But if there are multiple monkeys, if one is asleep, then none of them kicked Hazel. But if another monkey is also asleep, it's the same condition. So maybe that's acceptable. \n\nBut which interpretation is correct? Let's think. The phrase \"every monkey is asleep only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" can be read as: The only way that every monkey is asleep is if no monkeys kicked Hazel. So, if every monkey is asleep, then it must be that no monkeys kicked Hazel. So this would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c))). \n\nAlternatively, if we take \"only if\" as applying to each instance, like each monkey's being asleep requires that no monkeys kicked Hazel, then we have \u2200x [(Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c))]. But in this case, if there's even one monkey that is asleep, then the condition must hold. Which is equivalent to (\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Jx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c)). But the original says \"every monkey is asleep only if...\", so maybe the first interpretation is better. \n\nBut let's check with an example. Suppose all monkeys are asleep. Then according to the first interpretation, the consequent requires that no monkeys kicked Hazel. If even one monkey is asleep, according to the second interpretation, it would require the same. However, the original statement's phrasing is \"every monkey is asleep only if...\", which suggests that the entire condition of all being asleep depends on the kicking condition. Therefore, the correct translation would be that if all monkeys are asleep, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. Therefore, the consequent is (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c)). \n\nBut wait, the original sentence is structured as \"If A, then (B only if C)\", where A is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\", B is \"every monkey is asleep\", and C is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\". So the entire implication is \u00acR(c, c) \u2192 [B only if C], which is \u00acR(c, c) \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Therefore, substituting B and C, we have \u00acR(c, c) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c))) ].\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way to write this. Let me check. The consequent is a material implication where the antecedent is \"every monkey is asleep\" and the consequent is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\". But \"every monkey is asleep\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx), and \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c)). Therefore, the whole consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c)). \n\nBut perhaps the variables can be reused. Since x and y are bound variables, we can write \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)). \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire formula is \u00acR(c, c) \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c))]. \n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes implications can be combined. Let me check if there's a way to simplify this. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAnother way to approach \"every monkey is asleep only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is to recognize that \"only if\" here is a universal quantifier. So, for every monkey, if it is asleep, then it must be that no monkeys kicked Hazel. Which would be \u2200x [(Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c))]. This would mean that for each individual monkey being asleep, the condition must hold. However, this seems stronger than the previous interpretation. Because if even one monkey is asleep, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. Whereas the previous interpretation required that if all monkeys are asleep, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. Which one is correct?\n\nThe original sentence says \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" So the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" statement. Therefore, it's the case that if every monkey is asleep, then the condition must hold. Therefore, the correct translation is the first approach: (\u00acR(c,c)) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y,c))) ].\n\nAlternatively, in logic, implications can be reassociated. The formula A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So the entire formula can be rewritten as (\u00acR(c,c) \u2227 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y,c)). \n\nBut since the problem asks for a well-formed formula, either form is acceptable. However, the example given in the problem uses a conditional with a universal quantifier in the antecedent and a relational atom in the consequent. So perhaps following the structure of the example, the answer should be in the form of an implication where the antecedent is \u00acR(c,c) and the consequent is the implication between the universal statements.\n\nTherefore, the final formula would be:\n\n\u00acR(c, c) \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c))]\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can use the same variable for both universals. So maybe:\n\n\u00acR(c, c) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)))\n\nBut variables are bound, so renaming them is allowed. However, the problem may prefer distinct variables for clarity, but it's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the consequent can be written as \u2200x ( (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)) ), but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, no. The consequent is the implication between two universal statements. So the correct way is to have the implication between the two universal quantifications.\n\nTherefore, the formalization is:\n\n\u00acR(c, c) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)) )\n\nAlternatively, since the two universal quantifiers can be combined. Let me check if there's a way to simplify this. Suppose we have \u2200x ( (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)) ). But this would be equivalent to \u2200x ( (\u00acOx \u2228 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acOx \u2228 \u00acQ(x, c)) ), which simplifies to \u2200x ( (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)) ). But this is equivalent to \u2200x ( (Jx \u2228 \u00acOx) \u2228 (\u00acOx \u2228 \u00acQ(x, c)) ), but that's not helpful. Actually, this approach might not capture the original meaning correctly. Because if Ox is false, then both implications hold vacuously. If Ox is true, then Jx must imply \u00acQ(x, c). Therefore, this would be equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c))). \n\nWait, this is a different approach. Let's think again. The original consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\". Let's rephrase this as: For every monkey, if it is asleep, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. Which would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c)) ). But this is similar to earlier thoughts. However, this seems to tie each individual monkey's being asleep to the global condition of no monkeys kicking Hazel. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct way is to see that \"every monkey is asleep only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is equivalent to saying that if every monkey is asleep, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. Which is the same as (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c)). \n\nBut how to translate this into predicate logic. The entire implication is \u00acR(c,c) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y, c)) ].\n\nIn standard syntax, this would be written with the arrows and quantifiers. So the final formula is:\n\n\u00acR(c,c) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y,c)) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, it's acceptable to have multiple quantifiers and implications. Now, checking the example given in the problem: the example had \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the structure is a universal quantifier with an implication. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be structured as the implication of the antecedent (\u00acR(c,c)) leading to the implication between the two universal statements. \n\nAnother thing to check is whether \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is correctly translated as \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y,c)). Yes, because for all y, if y is a monkey, then y did not kick Hazel. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization is:\n\n\u00acR(c,c) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y,c)) )\n\nAlternatively, since variables are bound, we can use the same variable for both universals, but it's clearer to use different ones. However, in formal logic, it's allowed to reuse variables as long as they are bound. So perhaps:\n\n\u00acR(c,c) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x,c)) )\n\nBut I think using different variables is better for clarity, even though in formal logic it's not necessary. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n\u00acR(c,c) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQ(y,c)) )\n\nThis seems to be the correct formalization based on the analysis.\n</think>\n\n\u00acR(c,c)\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Jx)\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192\u00acQ(y,c)))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is: \"If Alfred ate, then a human chased Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure seems to be a conditional statement. The first part is \"If Alfred ate,\" which translates to Ia. The second part is a bit more complex: \"a human chased Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nThe phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the statement \"a human chased Lewis only if every human saw Hazel\" would be: If there exists a human who chased Lewis, then every human saw Hazel.\n\nLet me parse that. The first part of the \"only if\" is \"a human chased Lewis,\" which is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), since N is \"is a human\" and b is Lewis. The second part is \"every human saw Hazel,\" which is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc), because P is \"saw\" and c is Hazel.\n\nPutting that together, the \"only if\" part becomes (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nNow, the entire original sentence is \"If Alfred ate, then [that implication].\" So combining it, the whole formula is Ia \u2192 [ (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc) ].\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any scope issues or if I need to adjust the quantifiers. The existential quantifier is for the existence of a human chasing Lewis, and the universal quantifier applies to all humans seeing Hazel. That seems correct.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't mix up the direction of the implication. Since \"only if\" is B \u2192 A, wait no. Wait, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. For example, \"I will go outside only if it is sunny\" translates to GoOutside \u2192 Sunny. So if A happens only when B is true. So yes, the initial translation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is Ia \u2192 ( \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc) ). \n\nBut I need to make sure about the parentheses. Since implication is right-associative? Or maybe I should add parentheses to make the structure clear. Let me check. The main connective is the first implication (If Alfred ate... then ...). The consequent is another implication.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"is a donkey,\" G for \"will attack,\" R for \"chased,\" and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The phrase \"Not all donkeys will attack\" translates to \"It is not the case that all donkeys will attack.\" In predicate logic, \"All donkeys will attack\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). So \"Not all\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx), but maybe the original form is better here.\n\nThen, the structure is \"Not all... unless...\" which is a bit tricky. The general form of \"A unless B\" is usually translated as A \u2228 B, but sometimes it's \u00acA \u2192 B. Wait, let me recall. In logic, \"A unless B\" can be interpreted as \"If not B, then A\" or \"If not A, then B.\" Hmm. Let me think. For example, \"I will go unless it rains\" can be read as \"If it doesn't rain, I will go\" (\u00acB \u2192 A) or \"If I don't go, then it rains\" (\u00acA \u2192 B). Both are logically equivalent. So depending on how we structure it, either way works.\n\nIn this case, the sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" Let me denote:\n\nLet A = \"Not all donkeys will attack\" (which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx))\n\nLet B = \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" (which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rx a))\n\nSo the sentence is A unless B. So translating that as \u00acB \u2192 A. Because if B is not true (i.e., not every donkey chased Alfred), then A holds (not all donkeys attack). Alternatively, it could be A \u2228 B. Let me check which one makes sense.\n\nOriginal sentence: If it's not the case that every donkey chased Alfred, then not all donkeys will attack. Wait, but \"unless\" is like an alternative. So maybe the correct translation is \u00acB \u2192 A, which would be \"If not B, then A.\" So substituting, \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). But wait, the original sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey chased Alfred,\" which is equivalent to \"If it is not the case that every donkey chased Alfred, then not all donkeys will attack.\" Alternatively, \"Not all donkeys will attack or every donkey chased Alfred.\"\n\nBut let me check the equivalence. \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" So both forms are acceptable. However, in predicate logic, depending on how we structure the quantifiers, we might need to be careful.\n\nSo the two options are:\n\n1. \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa)\n\n2. \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)\n\nBut these are equivalent because of material implication. Since A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. So if we take the second form, \u00acB \u2192 A, which would be \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). But that's equivalent to the first form. So both are okay. However, perhaps the first form is more straightforward.\n\nBut let's make sure. The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" So \"unless\" here is a conditional. So the correct way is to take the negation of the \"unless\" condition leading to the first part. So \"Not all donkeys attack unless every donkey chased Alfred\" becomes \"If it is not the case that every donkey chased Alfred, then not all donkeys attack.\" Which is \u00acB \u2192 A, where B is \"every donkey chased Alfred,\" and A is \"not all donkeys attack.\"\n\nBut another way to think about it is that \"unless\" introduces a necessary condition. For the donkeys to attack, it's necessary that every donkey chased Alfred. Wait, but the original sentence is saying that if the condition (every donkey chased Alfred) isn't met, then not all will attack. So the necessary condition for all donkeys attacking is that every donkey chased Alfred. Which would mean that if not every donkey chased Alfred, then not all attack. Which is the same as saying that if all donkeys attack, then every donkey chased Alfred. Which would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). But that's the contrapositive. However, the original sentence is structured as \"Not all... unless...\" which is equivalent to \"If not B, then not all...\" So perhaps the correct translation is \u00acB \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(...). Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the contrapositive. Let's consider that \"Not all donkeys will attack unless B\" can be rephrased as \"If all donkeys will attack, then B.\" Because \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"If not B, then A,\" which is contrapositive to \"If not A, then B.\" So if we take A as \"Not all donkeys attack,\" then \"If not B, then A\" is equivalent to \"If all donkeys attack, then B.\" So the contrapositive would be: \u00acA \u2192 B. Which would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). But is that equivalent to the original?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the original is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" So if every donkey did chase Alfred, then maybe all could attack, but if not, then not all will. So the contrapositive form would be: If all donkeys will attack, then every donkey chased Alfred. Which is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). But how to translate that into predicate logic? That would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). However, the problem is that the original sentence uses \"Not all...\", so maybe we need to stick with the original structure.\n\nBut the user wants the formalization using the given abbreviations, so perhaps the best approach is to use the \"A unless B\" as A \u2228 B. So \"Not all donkeys attack\" \u2228 \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\" So that would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). Alternatively, since \"Not all\" is equivalent to \"There exists a donkey that does not attack,\" which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx), but maybe the user expects the use of the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nAlternatively, using the implication form. Let's check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they used the universal quantifier with implication. So for \"Not all donkeys will attack,\" we can use \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). So combining that with the \"unless\" part, which is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa), we can have \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). Alternatively, using material implication, that's equivalent to \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). But which one is better?\n\nThe example uses the implication inside the quantifier. So perhaps the user expects the same approach here. Let me think. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So for the \"unless\" part, the user might prefer the disjunction of the two statements. So \"Not all donkeys will attack\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx), and \"every donkey chased Alfred\" is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). Therefore, the entire sentence would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). But in logic, disjunction can be used here. However, sometimes people prefer to avoid having a disjunction between two universal or existential statements unless necessary. But in this case, since \"unless\" is being translated as a disjunction, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we use the implication form, it would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Which is equivalent. Let me check if these are equivalent. Let me recall that A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. So if we take A as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) and B as \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa), then A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B, which would be \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa), which simplifies to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). Wait, that's different from the earlier \u00acB \u2192 A. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to A \u2228 B. So the correct translation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). Alternatively, using material implication, that's equivalent to \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa), which is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). But that's a different form. However, the original sentence is \"Not all... unless...\", which is equivalent to \"If not B, then A.\" Which would be \u00acB \u2192 A. Where B is \"every donkey chased Alfred,\" so \u00acB is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). Therefore, \u00acB \u2192 A is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Which is equivalent to the contrapositive of the previous implication. Because if \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) is equivalent to \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) by contraposition. So both forms are equivalent.\n\nBut which one is the correct way to formalize the original sentence? The user's example uses the implication inside the quantifier. Let's look at the example again. The example's sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" which is a universal statement. The formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So in the case of \"Not all donkeys will attack,\" the negation of a universal quantifier. So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). So combining with the \"unless\" part, which is another universal, the disjunction between them would be acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the use of quantifiers and connectives in a certain way. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" So \"unless\" can be thought of as \"if not,\" so \"If it is not the case that every donkey chased Alfred, then not all donkeys will attack.\" So that's \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Alternatively, since the negation of a universal is an existential, that would be equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx). But that's a different form. However, the user's example uses the universal quantifier with implication, so perhaps they expect the same here.\n\nBut which is more standard? In logic, when translating \"unless,\" it's often handled as a material implication. So \"A unless B\" is A \u2228 B, which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. So depending on which side is more convenient. In this case, since the sentence is \"Not all... unless...\", translating it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2228 \u2200x(...) is acceptable. However, in standard logic, disjunctions of quantified statements can sometimes be tricky, but they are allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the implication form. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa)\n\nOption 2: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)\n\nBoth are logically equivalent. However, the example uses the implication inside the quantifier. Let me check if the example's structure would suggest using one form over the other. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is a universal. So if the user expects the same structure, perhaps the implication form (option 2) is better, since it uses implications and quantifiers similarly to the example.\n\nBut how to decide? Let me think of another example. Suppose we have \"John will go unless it rains.\" Translating that as \"John will go \u2228 it rains,\" or \"If it doesn't rain, then John will go.\" Both are correct. In predicate logic, if we have more complex quantifiers, the same applies.\n\nIn this case, the sentence is about two universal statements. The original sentence says that the failure of the second (not every donkey chased Alfred) leads to the first (not all donkeys attack). So using the implication form (option 2) would be appropriate here. However, the problem is that in predicate logic, when you have quantifiers, the order and scope matter. For example, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa). Similarly, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx). So another way to write option 2 is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx). But that might not be as concise as the original.\n\nBut the user's example uses the universal form with implication, so perhaps the expected answer is to use the same structure. Let me try to write both forms and see which one aligns with standard practice.\n\nAnother approach: Let's rephrase the original sentence. \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" This can be rephrased as \"If not every donkey chased Alfred, then not all donkeys will attack.\" Which is the same as \"If every donkey did not chase Alfred, then not every donkey will attack.\" So translating that directly would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Which is option 2.\n\nAlternatively, using the contrapositive, this is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). Which is another way to express the same thing. However, the original sentence is about \"not all\" donkeys attacking, so perhaps the contrapositive form is less direct.\n\nGiven that the example uses the universal quantifier with implication, the expected answer might be the implication form. So I think the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the disjunction. Let me think again. The example uses a universal statement. The original sentence has a negation of a universal and a universal. So combining them with a disjunction is acceptable. So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). But in this case, the disjunction is between two universally quantified statements. However, in logic, that's allowed. For example, if you have two statements, you can have their disjunction.\n\nBut which one is more standard? In formal logic, when translating \"A unless B,\" it's often better to use the material implication form, especially when dealing with quantifiers. So perhaps \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) is better. However, I'm a bit confused because the example uses a universal statement, but the current problem involves a negation of a universal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the existential quantifier. Let me try to think of the sentence as: If there exists a donkey that didn't chase Alfred, then there exists a donkey that won't attack. Which would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx). But that's another equivalent form. However, the user's example uses the universal quantifier with implication, so perhaps they expect the same here. Let me check the example again. The example's sentence is \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" which is a universal statement. The formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the original sentence is about \"not all,\" which is the negation of a universal, then perhaps the expected answer is to use the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nBut the problem is that \"unless\" introduces a disjunction. So the correct formalization would be the disjunction between the negation of the universal (not all donkeys attack) and the universal (every donkey chased Alfred). Therefore, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). But in this case, the disjunction is between two quantified statements, which is allowed. However, in standard predicate logic, it's acceptable to have such a disjunction. For example, if you have two separate statements connected by a logical connective.\n\nBut another way to look at it is that \"unless\" is a logical connective that can be represented as an implication. So the sentence is equivalent to \"If not every donkey chased Alfred, then not all donkeys will attack,\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). This is equivalent to the disjunction form.\n\nSince both are equivalent, but the example uses implication inside the quantifier, perhaps the user expects the implication form here. However, the example is a straightforward universal statement, while this problem involves a more complex structure. But given that the example uses implication, maybe the answer should follow the same pattern. Let me go with the implication form.\n\nSo the final answer would be: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)\n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" So \"unless\" is like \"if not,\" so \"If not every donkey chased Alfred, then not all donkeys will attack.\" Which is exactly what the implication form states. Therefore, that's the correct translation. So the formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx).\n\nAlternatively, using the contrapositive, it's equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa). But the original sentence is about the negation of the universal (not all attack) being the case unless the other universal holds. So the implication form where the antecedent is the negation of the \"unless\" condition leading to the negation of the universal is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx).\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa)\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)",

The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So the overall form is If A, then (B only if C). \n\nLet me parse each part. \n\nStarting with the antecedent of the main conditional: \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and P is \"[1] saw [2]\". Lewis is represented by b. So \"every monkey saw Lewis\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"B only if C\" is typically translated as B \u2192 C. So here, B is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" and C is \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n\nFirst, \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" would be \u00acQac, since Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\", a is Alfred, and c is Hazel. \n\nThen, \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). Because Lewis is b, and we're saying for every monkey x, x kicked b.\n\nPutting the \"only if\" together: \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nSo the entire main conditional is: If \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb), then (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb)). \n\nSo combining these, the formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb))\n\nWait, but I need to check if the variables are properly quantified. The antecedent uses x, then in the consequent, the implication uses x again. But since each quantifier is in a separate scope, the x in the consequent is a new x. So that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use different variables for clarity, but since the problem says to use the abbreviations given and standard syntax, and variables are typically reused in different scopes, it's acceptable. \n\nLet me double-check the translation. The original sentence: If every monkey saw Lewis, then (Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis). \n\nYes, the structure is correct. The main conditional connects the two parts. The \"only if\" translates to an implication where the antecedent is the negated kick and the consequent is the universal statement about monkeys kicking Lewis. \n\nI think that's all. Let me write the final formula.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem. First, I need to parse the sentence carefully: \"If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" \n\nThe abbreviations given are P for \"[1] saw [2]\", a for Alfred, b for Lewis, O for \"[1] is a monkey\", L for \"[1] is hungry\", and N for \"[1] is a human\". \n\nThe main structure of the sentence is a conditional: If (Alfred doesn't see Lewis), then (every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry). \n\nBreaking down the first part: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" translates to \u00acPab. Because P is [1] saw [2], so Alfred (a) didn't see Lewis (b) is \u00acPab.\n\nNow the consequent: \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So if we have \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\", that would mean that for all monkeys, if they are hungry, then it must be that no humans are hungry. \n\nSo the consequent is: For all x, if O(x) (x is a monkey) and L(x) (x is hungry), then for all y, if N(y) (y is a human), then \u00acL(y) (y is not hungry). Wait, maybe another way: The \"no humans are hungry\" part is equivalent to saying there does not exist a human who is hungry. So \u00ac\u2203y (N(y) \u2227 L(y)). \n\nAlternatively, \"no humans are hungry\" is \u2200y (N(y) \u2192 \u00acL(y)). Either way, both are equivalent. So perhaps the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))? Wait, no. Wait the original is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\". Let me rephrase that. Let me think of it as: If every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry. Wait, but the \"only if\" applies to each monkey. So maybe for every monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. So \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)). \n\nBut the original is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" So the \"only if\" is connecting the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" to the \"no humans are hungry.\" So maybe the structure is: (For all monkeys, they are hungry) \u2192 (no humans are hungry). But that would be different. Let me think. \n\nIn logic, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if A is \"every monkey is hungry\", then B is \"no humans are hungry\". Therefore, the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). \n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" So the \"only if\" is not about each monkey, but about the entire statement. So the entire antecedent is \"every monkey is hungry\", and the consequent is \"no humans are hungry.\" Therefore, the consequent of the main conditional is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). \n\nBut maybe another approach: The original can be rephrased as \"If every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry.\" Which is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nSo putting it all together, the main conditional is \u00acPab \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy)]. \n\nWait, but in logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, maybe the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))). But that would mean for each monkey, if it is hungry, then there are no hungry humans. But that seems more strict. For example, if there's a monkey that is not hungry, then the implication holds regardless. But the original statement is that the entire condition of all monkeys being hungry requires that no humans are hungry. \n\nSo if we take the \"only if\" as applying to the entire universal statement, then the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). \n\nSo the entire formula would be \u00acPab \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)]. \n\nAlternatively, since implications can be transformed, \u00acPab \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy)]. \n\nBut how to write this properly. Let's check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So for the consequent, the structure is a conditional where the antecedent is \"every monkey is hungry\" and the consequent is \"no humans are hungry\". \n\nBut how to express \"every monkey is hungry\"? That's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). \n\nAnd \"no humans are hungry\" is \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nSo the consequent of the main implication is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acPab \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy)]. \n\nBut in predicate logic, we can also write this using the quantifiers. Alternatively, maybe we can combine the quantifiers. Let me check if there's another way. \n\nAlternatively, the consequent could be expressed as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). Which is equivalent to the previous version. \n\nBut in terms of formalization, perhaps the first way is better. \n\nSo putting it all together: \n\nThe main formula is \u00acPab \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, we need to make sure that variables are properly quantified. Also, note that the variables x and y can be reused if they are in different scopes. \n\nAlternatively, since the consequent is a material implication between two universally quantified statements. \n\nSo the final formula would be: \n\n\u00acPab \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) )\n\nBut perhaps using different variables for clarity, but since x is bound in both, it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the formalization is: \n\n\u00acPab \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) )\n\nAlternatively, maybe the consequent can be written as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nBut in terms of the abbreviations given, that's acceptable. \n\nSo the final answer should be: \n\n\u00acPab \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy) )\n\nBut since variables are bound, using x again in the second universal is okay. However, in some formal systems, it's preferred to have different variables. But since the example uses x for all, maybe it's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, the consequent could be written as ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) )\n\nWhich is equivalent. Let's check: \n\n\u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) is equivalent to \u2200y \u00ac(Ny \u2227 Ly), which is \u2200y (\u00acNy \u2228 \u00acLy), which is \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). So both forms are equivalent. \n\nSo perhaps the first way is better for consistency with the example. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u00acPab \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy) )\n\nNow, checking the structure again. The main connective is the implication with \u00acPab as antecedent and the consequent being another implication. \n\nYes. So the entire formula is correct. \n\nI think that's the right approach.\n</think>\n\n\u00acPab\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx)\u2192\u2200y(Ny\u2192\u00acLy))",

The abbreviations are M for \"[1] is a donkey\", b for Lewis, O for \"[1] is a monkey\", and G for \"[1] will attack\". \n\nFirst, I should parse the original sentence. The sentence structure seems a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted in two ways: either \"Lewis is a donkey or a monkey, and that animal will attack,\" or \"Lewis is a donkey, or a monkey will attack (regardless of Lewis being a monkey or not).\" The original sentence isn't entirely clear, but based on the structure, it might be the latter. Let me think.\n\nThe sentence is \"Lewis is a donkey or a monkey will attack.\" The \"or\" here connects two clauses: \"Lewis is a donkey\" and \"a monkey will attack.\" So the structure is (A or B), where A is \"Lewis is a donkey\" and B is \"a monkey will attack.\"\n\nUsing the abbreviations: \"Lewis is a donkey\" would be Mb (since M is [1] is a donkey, and b is Lewis). Then \"a monkey will attack\" would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Gx), because we need to say there exists some x that is a monkey and will attack. So the entire formula would be Mb \u2228 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Gx). \n\nWait, but the sentence might be interpreted as \"Lewis is a donkey or a monkey, and will attack.\" But the original sentence says \"Lewis is a donkey or a monkey will attack.\" The placement of \"will attack\" is after the \"or,\" so it's more likely that the \"will attack\" applies only to the monkey. So the correct interpretation is either Lewis is a donkey, or there is a monkey who will attack. Therefore, the logical form should be Mb \u2228 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Gx).\n\nLet me check if there's another way. If the sentence were \"Lewis is a donkey or a monkey who will attack,\" then it would be (Mb \u2228 Ob) \u2227 Gb. But that's not the case here. The original sentence's structure is \"Lewis is a donkey or a monkey will attack,\" which separates the two possibilities: Lewis being a donkey, or a monkey (any monkey) attacking.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The sentence is \"Every monkey saw every human.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, the abbreviations are O for \"is a monkey,\" N for \"is a human,\" and P for \"[1] saw [2].\" So, the goal is to express that for all monkeys, each one saw every human.\n\nIn predicate logic, when you have \"Every A did something to every B,\" you typically use two universal quantifiers. Let me break it down. For every x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then for every y, if y is a human (Ny), then x saw y (Pxy). \n\nSo the structure would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pxy)). Alternatively, you can write the quantifiers together as \u2200x\u2200y (Ox \u2192 (Ny \u2192 Pxy)). But I think the first way with nesting is more standard here. Let me check: the original example had \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is similar. So applying that structure here, it should be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pxy)).\n\nWait, but sometimes the order of quantifiers matters. Since both are universal, the order might not matter here. But in this case, since each monkey must see every human, it's a universal over monkeys and a universal over humans. So the correct formalization is for all x, if x is a monkey, then for all y, if y is a human, then Pxy. That seems right. So combining the quantifiers, maybe it can also be written as \u2200x\u2200y (Ox \u2227 Ny \u2192 Pxy). But I think the implication is better because Ox and Ny are conditions. Let me think again: if we use \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 Pxy)), that's equivalent to \u2200x\u2200y (Ox \u2192 (Ny \u2192 Pxy)), which is equivalent to \u2200x\u2200y ((Ox \u2227 Ny) \u2192 Pxy). So both forms are acceptable, but the first one with nested implications is more direct based on the example provided. The example used implications, so maybe sticking with that structure is better. So the final answer should be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pxy)). Let me check again. Yes, that's correct. Every monkey (Ox) implies that for every human (Ny), the monkey saw the human (Pxy).

The sentence is \"Lewis saw Alfred and Lewis is happy.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. There are two parts connected by \"and\": \"Lewis saw Alfred\" and \"Lewis is happy.\" \n\nLooking at the abbreviations, P is \"[1] saw [2]\". So for \"Lewis saw Alfred\", since Lewis is the subject (the one doing the seeing), he would be the first argument, and Alfred the second. The abbreviations given are b for Lewis and a for Alfred. So that part would be Pba. Because P takes two arguments, the first being Lewis (b) and the second Alfred (a).\n\nThen the second part is \"Lewis is happy.\" The abbreviation K is \"[1] is happy\", so that would be Kb, since Lewis is the subject here again.\n\nSince the two parts are connected by \"and\", in logical terms that's the conjunction symbol \u2227. So combining them, it should be Pba \u2227 Kb. \n\nI need to make sure there are no quantifiers here because the sentence is about specific individuals (Lewis and Alfred), not making a general statement about all or some. So no \u2200 or \u2203 needed. \n\nDouble-checking the abbreviations: P is for saw, with two arguments. Yes, that's correct. And K is for being happy, single argument. Yep. So the final formula should just be the conjunction of those two statements. No parentheses needed here because it's just two atomic formulas connected by \u2227.

The main structure is a conditional: \"If every human is asleep, then Lewis won't run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, the antecedent is \"every human is asleep.\" Using the abbreviations, N is \"[1] is a human\" and J is \"[1] is asleep.\" So, translating that part would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent is \"Lewis won't run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the \"Lewis won't run\" is the A part, and \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is the B part. So the structure would be (\u00acFb) \u2192 (every monkey saw Hazel). \n\nLet's handle \"every monkey saw Hazel.\" The abbreviation O is \"[1] is a monkey,\" and P is \"[1] saw [2].\" Hazel is denoted by c. So, for all x, if Ox then Px c.

Since the original sentence is \"If every human is asleep, then [Lewis won't run only if every monkey saw Hazel],\" the main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent.

The sentence is a disjunction (OR) of two statements: \"Every donkey is happy\" and \"Every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Every donkey is happy.\" In predicate logic, this would typically be a universal quantifier over donkeys. So for all x, if x is a donkey (Mx), then x is happy (Kx). That translates to \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx).\n\nNow the second part: \"Every human saw Hazel.\" Similarly, this is a universal quantifier over humans. For all x, if x is a human (Nx), then x saw Hazel (Pxc, since c is Hazel). So that's \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nThe original sentence combines these two with an \"or,\" so the entire formula should be the disjunction of the two universal statements. Therefore, the formalization would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the variables are correctly scoped. Both quantifiers are universal, and they can use the same variable name (like x) because they are separate quantifiers. In predicate logic, each quantifier has its own scope, so using x in both is acceptable. So the formula is correct as written.\n\nI don't see any other elements in the sentence that need to be captured. The disjunction is between the two universal statements.

So, the sentence has two parts: Alfred being happy and a monkey being happy.\n\nFor the first part, \"Alfred is happy\" would be K with a as the argument, so Ka. That's straightforward.\n\nThe second part is \"a monkey is happy\". Since O is \"[1] is a monkey\", we need to say there exists some monkey that is happy. So that would be an existential quantifier. So \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Kx). Wait, because we need to assert that there's an x which is a monkey (Ox) and is happy (Kx). \n\nPutting them together with the conjunction. The original sentence uses \"and\", so we need to combine Ka with \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Kx) using \u2227. So the entire formula would be Ka \u2227 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Kx). \n\nWait, but do I need parentheses? Let me check. The conjunction is between Ka and the existential statement.

I need to translate the sentence \"If Hazel is hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the main structure of the sentence is a conditional: If Hazel is hungry, then [something]. The \"something\" is a bit complex: \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" Let me parse that part.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"If Hazel is hungry...\" Using the abbreviations, L is \"[1] is hungry\" and c is Hazel. So, Hazel being hungry is Lc.\n\nNow the consequent: \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. But here, the structure is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" So, for each monkey, if the monkey saw Hazel, then it must be that no donkeys ate. Wait, but \"no donkeys ate\" would be the negation of \"there exists a donkey that ate.\" So maybe \"no donkeys ate\" is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Because Mx is \"x is a donkey\" and Ix is \"x ate.\" So the negation would be that there's no x such that x is a donkey and x ate.\n\nSo putting that together: The consequent is saying that for every monkey, if that monkey saw Hazel, then \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Let me formalize that. The monkey part is O, which is \"[1] is a monkey.\" So for every x, if Ox (x is a monkey), then Pxy where y is Hazel. Wait, P is \"[1] saw [2].\" So Pxz where z is c (Hazel). So for every x, Ox \u2192 (Px c \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy)). Wait, no, the structure is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" So the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" part? Or to each individual monkey's seeing?\n\nLet me think again. The phrase is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" So the \"only if\" is connecting the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" to the \"no donkeys ate.\" So that would translate as: If every monkey saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. But that's not quite right. Wait, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So in this case, A is \"every monkey saw Hazel,\" and B is \"no donkeys ate.\" Therefore, the consequent would be: (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). But the original sentence is structured as \"If Hazel is hungry, then [this implication].\" So the entire thing would be Lc \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) ].\n\nBut maybe I'm misinterpreting. Another way to parse \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate\" is that for each monkey, if they saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. So for every x, (Ox \u2227 Pxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy). That would be \u2200x [(Ox \u2227 Pxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(My \u2227 Iy)]. But which is correct?\n\nThe original sentence is a bit ambiguous. But in English, \"only if\" can sometimes be nested. Let me consider the example given in the problem. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the structure is straightforward. Now, the current problem's sentence is a conditional where the consequent is a statement involving \"only if.\"\n\nLet me recall that \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So if the consequent is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate,\" then that would be: Let A be \"every monkey saw Hazel,\" and B be \"no donkeys ate.\" So A \u2192 B. Therefore, the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). Therefore, the entire formula would be Lc \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"only if\" applies per monkey. For example, for each monkey, if the monkey saw Hazel, then it must be that no donkeys ate. That would be \u2200x [ (Ox \u2227 Pxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) ]. Which is equivalent to \u2200x [ Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)) ].\n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The original sentence is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The \"only if\" is modifying the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" condition. So if all monkeys saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. But that seems a bit odd. Because if all monkeys saw Hazel, that's A, and then B is no donkeys ate. So A implies B. But maybe the intended meaning is that for each monkey, their seeing Hazel requires that no donkeys ate. So that would be for each monkey, if they saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. Which would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))).\n\nBut how does that differ from the other interpretation? Let's see. Suppose there are two monkeys. If both saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. But if only one saw, then maybe donkeys could have eaten. But the second interpretation says that if any monkey saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. So in that case, even if only one monkey saw Hazel, the condition would require that no donkeys ate. The first interpretation (the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" implies no donkeys ate) would allow that if not every monkey saw Hazel, then maybe donkeys ate. But the original sentence says \"every monkey saw Hazel only if...\" So maybe the correct way is that whenever every monkey saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. But the original sentence is structured as a conditional where the antecedent is Hazel being hungry, leading to that implication.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the original sentence again: \"If Hazel is hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"only if\" here is in the consequent. So perhaps the correct formalization is that when Hazel is hungry, then the following holds: For every monkey, if that monkey saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. So that would be Lc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"only if\" is part of the entire consequent. For example, the whole \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is the antecedent of an implication whose consequent is \"no donkeys ate.\" So the consequent would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). Therefore, the entire formula would be Lc \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) ].\n\nWhich is correct? Let me think of an example. Suppose Hazel is hungry. Then, if all monkeys saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. But if some monkeys didn't see her, maybe donkeys ate. Alternatively, if Hazel is hungry, then for each monkey, if that monkey saw her, then no donkeys ate. In this case, even if not all monkeys saw her, whenever a monkey does see her, the donkeys didn't eat.\n\nThe original sentence uses \"every monkey saw Hazel only if...\", which is a bit ambiguous. But in formal logic, \"only if\" typically introduces a necessary condition. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if we have \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate,\" that would mean that the fact that every monkey saw Hazel can only happen if no donkeys ate. So if every monkey saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. Therefore, the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). Therefore, the entire formula is Lc \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)].\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to treat the \"only if\" as applying to each instance. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So if we have a similar structure here, maybe the \"only if\" is part of a conditional. Let me think of \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate\" as equivalent to \"if every monkey saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate.\" So that would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). Therefore, the whole formula is Lc \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) ].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"only if\" is part of the \"saw Hazel\" part. For example, \"every monkey [saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate].\" Which would mean that for each monkey, their seeing Hazel is only if no donkeys ate. So for each x, if Ox, then (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)). Which would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))).\n\nWhich is more accurate? Let me consider the wording. The original sentence is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The placement of \"only if\" suggests that the entire \"saw Hazel\" is conditional on \"no donkeys ate.\" So for each monkey, if they saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. Therefore, the correct formalization would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))).\n\nBut another way to look at it is that \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is a single event that only occurs if no donkeys ate. So the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is the antecedent of an implication whose consequent is \"no donkeys ate.\" Therefore, (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy).\n\nBut which interpretation is correct? In English, \"only if\" can be a bit ambiguous. However, in logic, \"only if\" is typically used to express a necessary condition. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is A, then B is \"no donkeys ate,\" so A \u2192 B. Therefore, the consequent would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy).\n\nBut then, the original sentence is \"If Hazel is hungry, then [A only if B].\" So that would be Lc \u2192 (A \u2192 B). Which is the same as Lc \u2192 (A \u2192 B).\n\nAlternatively, if the \"only if\" is part of the \"saw Hazel,\" then it's for each monkey, their seeing Hazel requires B. So Lc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 B)).\n\nBut how to decide? Let me think of an example. Suppose Hazel is hungry. Then, if all monkeys saw her, then no donkeys ate. But if some monkeys saw her and others didn't, then maybe donkeys ate. But if the \"only if\" is per monkey, then even if one monkey saw her, then no donkeys ate. So which is more likely? The original sentence says \"every monkey saw Hazel only if...\" which might imply that the entire act of every monkey seeing her is conditional on no donkeys ate. But perhaps the correct interpretation is that for each monkey, their seeing her is conditional on no donkeys ate. \n\nLet me think of a simpler example. Suppose the sentence is \"John will go to the party only if Mary goes.\" That would be Gj \u2192 Gm, where Gj is John going and Gm is Mary going. Now, if the sentence were \"Every friend will go to the party only if Mary goes,\" that would mean that for each friend, if they go, then Mary goes. So \u2200x (Fx \u2192 (Gx \u2192 Gm)). Alternatively, if it were \"Every friend will go to the party only if Mary goes,\" that could be interpreted as if every friend goes, then Mary goes. Which would be (\u2200x (Fx \u2192 Gx)) \u2192 Gm. But which is correct? In common usage, the former is more likely. If the sentence is \"Every friend will go only if Mary goes,\" it probably means that each friend's going is conditional on Mary going. So if any friend goes, Mary must go. Therefore, \u2200x (Fx \u2192 (Gx \u2192 Gm)).\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate\" probably means that each monkey's seeing Hazel is conditional on no donkeys ate. So for every monkey, if they saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate. Therefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))).\n\nTherefore, the entire formula would be Lc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))).\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations. L is \"[1] is hungry\", c is Hazel. O is \"[1] is a monkey\". P is \"[1] saw [2]\". M is \"[1] is a donkey\". I is \"[1] ate\". \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe main formula is Lc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))).\n\nBut we can also write \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy) as \u2200y \u00ac(My \u2227 Iy), which is equivalent. But the problem says to use standard logical symbols, and both \u2203 and \u2200 are allowed. However, the original instruction says to use the given abbreviations, which don't include anything for \"no donkeys ate\" except using M and I. So the correct way is to use \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy).\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\nLc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)))\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the syntax is correct. Quantifiers and connectives properly placed. Also, variables. The x in \u2200x is bound, and the y in \u2203y is bound. So the formula is well-formed.\n\nAnother thing to check: The scope of the quantifiers. The \u2203y is inside the implication. So the entire structure is:\n\nIf Lc, then for all x, if Ox, then (if Pxc then not exists y (My and Iy)).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nLc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy)))\n\nWhich can also be written with parentheses adjusted for clarity, but in standard syntax, that's acceptable.\n</think>\n\nLc\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Pxc\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(My\u2227Iy)))",

        },
        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the sentence properly: \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" The abbreviations given are Q for \"kicked\", a for Alfred, c for Hazel, O for being a monkey, L for being hungry, and N for being a human. \n\nSo the main structure is a conditional statement. The antecedent is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel,\" and the consequent is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" Let's break this down.\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" translates to \u00acQac. Because Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\", so Alfred (a) is the first argument and Hazel (c) is the second. The negation is because it's \"didn't kick.\"\n\nNow the consequent: \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is saying that for every monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. Wait, but the wording is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" So maybe it's structured as: For all x, if x is a monkey and x is hungry, then there are no humans who are hungry. Or perhaps more accurately, for every monkey, its being hungry implies that no humans are hungry. \n\nBut how to formalize \"only if no humans are hungry\"? Let me think. The consequent part of the main conditional is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" Let's rephrase that as: If every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry? No, that might not be right. Wait, the original is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" The \"only if\" applies to each individual monkey's hunger. So for each monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. So it's a universal quantifier over monkeys: For all x, (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))). Wait, maybe not. Wait, the structure is \"every monkey is hungry only if [condition]\". So \"only if\" here is like saying that the condition is necessary for the monkey being hungry. So for each monkey x, if x is hungry, then the condition holds. The condition here is \"no humans are hungry.\" So the consequent is: For all x, (if Ox and Lx, then \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)). Alternatively, maybe it's structured as (for all x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) only if (\u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)). But that would be different. The wording is ambiguous, but the original sentence says \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" The \"only if\" here is probably applying to each monkey's hunger. So, if a monkey is hungry, then it must be that no humans are hungry. Therefore, for all x, (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). \n\nBut then the entire consequent of the main conditional is this universal statement. So putting it all together, the main formula is \u00acQac \u2192 [\u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))]. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to parse it. The phrase \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\" could be read as: (For all monkeys, they are hungry) only if (no humans are hungry). In that case, it would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)). But that's a different structure. The original sentence's wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the exact wording again: \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" The \"only if\" is modifying the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" part. So the entire statement \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent of an \"only if\" clause. So that would be: If every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry. Which would translate to (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)). \n\nBut how to determine which interpretation is correct? Let's think about the meaning. Suppose there's at least one monkey that is hungry. If the first interpretation (for each monkey, if it's hungry then no humans are hungry) is used, then whenever any monkey is hungry, there can't be any hungry humans. In the second interpretation, only if all monkeys are hungry does that imply no humans are hungry. The original sentence says \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" which suggests that the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the condition. But the wording is a bit unclear. However, in formal logic, \"only if\" usually applies to the entire statement. For example, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the sentence is \"Every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry,\" then A is \"Every monkey is hungry\" and B is \"no humans are hungry.\" Therefore, the translation would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)). \n\nBut let's check with the example given. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the structure is straightforward. Now, in the current problem, the consequent is a bit more complex. Let me try to parse the original sentence again. The sentence is: If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then [every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry]. The part in brackets is the consequent. Let me consider two possible interpretations:\n\n1. For every monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. This would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) )\n\n2. If all monkeys are hungry, then no humans are hungry. This would be ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) )\n\nWhich one is correct? The original wording uses \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" which is similar to \"All A are B only if C.\" In such cases, the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"All A are B.\" For example, \"All birds fly only if the sky is clear\" would mean that if all birds fly, then the sky is clear. So the structure is (All A are B) \u2192 C. Therefore, in our case, the consequent would be ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). \n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" So the \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent of the \"only if.\" Therefore, the correct formalization would be ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). \n\nSo the entire formula would be \u00acQac \u2192 [ ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ) ]\n\nBut let's check if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the \"only if\" is part of the \"is hungry\" for each monkey. For example, \"A is hungry only if B\" would be A's being hungry implies B. So if the sentence is \"every monkey is hungry only if...\", then for each monkey, their being hungry implies the condition. Therefore, \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) )\n\nBut which is the correct interpretation? This is a common ambiguity in natural language. Let's see. The phrase \"only if\" introduces a necessary condition. So \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\" means that the condition (no humans are hungry) is necessary for every monkey being hungry. That is, if every monkey is hungry, then the condition must hold. So the correct interpretation is the second one: ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) )\n\nTherefore, the consequent is that implication. \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, we can also rephrase this. Let me check if there's a better way to structure it. The consequent is a material implication where the antecedent is \"all monkeys are hungry\" and the consequent is \"no humans are hungry.\" Therefore, the entire consequent is that implication. \n\nBut perhaps we can also write it as \u00acQac \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ), since A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. But maybe it's clearer to keep it as an implication. \n\nNow, considering that the problem asks for a well-formed formula in standard predicate logic syntax, using the given abbreviations. So the final formula would be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) )\n\nBut let me check if there's a way to simplify or rephrase this. Alternatively, using the equivalence A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So the entire formula can be rewritten as (\u00acQac \u2227 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). But the problem says to return a single well-formed formula, and both forms are acceptable. However, the example given uses implications directly, so maybe the first form is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original consequent can be expressed as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))). Which would be the first interpretation. Let me think again. If the \"only if\" applies per monkey, then for each monkey x, if x is hungry, then no humans are hungry. That would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). Which is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)) ). \n\nBut how to decide which interpretation is correct? The original sentence is ambiguous, but perhaps the intended meaning is the second interpretation where the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent of the \"only if\". However, in some logical analyses, \"only if\" can sometimes bind more tightly. For example, \"Every A is B only if C\" is often interpreted as (Every A is B) \u2192 C. However, there might be cases where it's read differently. \n\nGiven that the example provided uses a straightforward universal quantifier, perhaps the intended answer here is the first interpretation where the \"only if\" applies per monkey. Let me think again. Suppose we have \"Every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" If we parse it as for each monkey, being hungry requires that no humans are hungry, then the translation would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). Alternatively, if it's parsed as the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" requires that no humans are hungry, then it's (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). \n\nWhich one is more likely? Let's consider an example. Suppose there are two monkeys, M1 and M2. If the first interpretation holds, then if M1 is hungry, no humans can be hungry. Similarly, if M2 is hungry, no humans can be hungry. But if the second interpretation holds, then only if both M1 and M2 are hungry, then no humans can be hungry. \n\nThe original sentence says \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" which seems to suggest that the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the condition. However, in natural language, sometimes \"only if\" can be used in a way that applies to each instance. For example, \"Every student passed only if they studied\" would mean that each student's passing required that they studied, i.e., \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 Passed(x) \u2192 Studied(x)). \n\nIn that case, the correct translation would be the first interpretation. So applying that to our problem, \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\" would mean that for each monkey, if it is hungry, then it must be that no humans are hungry. Therefore, \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). \n\nTherefore, the consequent is \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). \n\nSo the entire formula is \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) )\n\nAlternatively, since in predicate logic, the scope can be adjusted. Let me write that properly. The consequent is a universal quantifier, so:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x [ (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ]\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n\u2200x [ (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ] \u2228 Qac\n\nBut since the problem requires implication, we stick with the implication form.\n\nNow, let's check if this is well-formed. The abbreviations are:\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\n\na: Alfred\n\nc: Hazel\n\nO: [1] is a monkey\n\nL: [1] is hungry\n\nN: [1] is a human\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) )\n\nYes. Now, we need to make sure that the variables are properly quantified. The \u2203y is inside the implication, and the \u2200x is outside. \n\nAlternatively, the \u2203y can be moved, but the structure is correct as written. \n\nTherefore, the final formalization should be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x((Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ly))\n\nI think that's the correct translation based on the interpretation that \"only if\" applies per monkey. However, I'm a bit uncertain because of the ambiguity in natural language. But given the example in the problem statement, where \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated with a universal quantifier and an implication, it's likely that the intended answer here is the version where the \"only if\" applies per monkey, leading to the universal quantifier over monkeys. \n\nAnother way to check: if we have \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry,\" and suppose there is a monkey that is hungry, then there must be no hungry humans. If there are two monkeys, and one is hungry, then the condition must hold. This would be captured by the first interpretation. The second interpretation would require that all monkeys are hungry before the condition applies. \n\nGiven that the original sentence uses \"every monkey is hungry\" as the antecedent of the \"only if,\" it's more likely that the intended meaning is that the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent. Wait, but that would mean that if every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry. However, if some monkeys are hungry and others are not, the condition doesn't apply. But the original wording is \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" which suggests that the condition is necessary for the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" to hold. So if even one monkey is not hungry, then the \"every monkey is hungry\" is false, so the implication holds vacuously. But if all monkeys are hungry, then the condition must hold. \n\nBut how does that interact with the main conditional? The main conditional is \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then [consequent].\" So if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then whenever all monkeys are hungry, there are no hungry humans. \n\nAlternatively, if the consequent is that for every monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry, then whenever any monkey is hungry, there can't be any hungry humans. This would be a stronger condition. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering standard logical translations, the \"only if\" in \"every A is B only if C\" is typically translated as (\u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x))) \u2192 C. Therefore, following that pattern, the consequent would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). \n\nBut in that case, the entire formula would be \u00acQac \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ]\n\nWhich is also a valid well-formed formula. \n\nSo which one is the correct answer? This is a bit of a problem. To resolve this, perhaps looking at the example given in the problem statement. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). This is a straightforward universal statement where each linguist admires Charlie. \n\nIf we consider the structure of the current problem's sentence, the consequent is a conditional where the \"only if\" is part of the consequent. The key is to parse the English correctly. \n\nAnother approach is to look at the structure of \"only if\". The phrase \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the sentence is \"Every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry,\" then A is \"Every monkey is hungry,\" and B is \"no humans are hungry.\" Therefore, the translation is A \u2192 B, where A is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) and B is \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). Therefore, the consequent is ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). \n\nThus, the entire formula is \u00acQac \u2192 ( ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes it's preferable to rephrase nested implications. For example, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So the formula can also be written as (\u00acQac \u2227 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). But the problem asks for a single well-formed formula using the given abbreviations, and either form is acceptable. However, the example uses a direct implication with a universal quantifier, so perhaps the first form is preferred. \n\nBut the problem is that the user might expect one answer over the other. Given that ambiguity, perhaps the intended answer is the first interpretation where the \"only if\" applies per monkey. However, given the example provided, which uses a universal quantifier for \"Every linguist...\", it's more likely that the intended answer is the second interpretation where the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent of the \"only if\". \n\nBut I'm still not 100% sure. Let me try to think of another example. Suppose the sentence was \"Every student passed only if they studied.\" This would typically be translated as \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 Passed(x) \u2192 Studied(x)), which is the first interpretation. So applying that pattern, \"Every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2227 Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)). \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is the first interpretation. Given that, the formula would be \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)). \n\nBut then again, in the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), which is similar to the first interpretation. So if we follow that pattern, then the correct translation here would be the first interpretation. \n\nTherefore, after considering various angles, I think the correct formalization is \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x((Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ly)). \n\nLet me check once more. If the sentence was \"Every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry,\" then for each monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. So for each x, if Ox and Lx, then \u00ac\u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ly). That seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x((Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ly)).\n</think>\n\n\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x((Ox\u2227Lx)\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(Ny\u2227Ly))",

The sentence is \"Hazel kicked a human.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, the abbreviations provided are N for \"[1] is a human,\" Q for \"[1] kicked [2],\" and c for Hazel. So Hazel is represented by the constant c.\n\nThe sentence says that Hazel kicked someone who is a human. The structure here is that there exists a person (a human) who was kicked by Hazel. So I need to use an existential quantifier because it's about the existence of at least one human that Hazel kicked.\n\nBreaking it down: Hazel is the one doing the kicking, so the first argument of Q (which stands for \"kicked\") should be c (Hazel). The second argument is the human. So Qck would mean Hazel kicked k. Then we need to state that k is a human, which is Nk. So combining these with the existential quantifier, it should be \u2203k (Nk \u2227 Qck). \n\nWait, but variables are usually x, y, z. The problem didn't specify using k, but since the abbreviation uses [1], maybe the variable is just a placeholder. So maybe I should use x instead. Let me check the example given. In the example, they used x as the variable. So the correct form would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Qcx). That makes sense. \n\nSo the formula is there exists an x such that x is a human and Hazel kicked x. That captures \"Hazel kicked a human.\" I need to make sure that the order in Q is correct: Q is [1] kicked [2]. So [1] is Hazel (c), and [2] is the human (x). So Qcx is correct. \n\nTherefore, the formalization should be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Qcx). I don't see any other ways to interpret the sentence. It's not a universal statement, so \u2200 isn't needed here. The key is the existence of at least one human that was kicked by Hazel.

The sentence is: \"If every human is asleep, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B.\" So the outer form is A \u2192 B.\n\nA is \"every human is asleep.\" Using the abbreviations, N(x) is \"[x] is a human\" and J(x) is \"[x] is asleep.\" So \"every human is asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx).\n\nNow B is \"Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, P is \"Alfred saw Alfred,\" which is Paa (since P is [1] saw [2], and both are Alfred). Q is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel,\" which is the negation of \"there exists a monkey that kicked Hazel.\" The abbreviation O(x) is \"[x] is a monkey,\" and Q(x, y) is \"[x] kicked [y].\" So \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qx c), where c is Hazel.\n\nPutting it together, B is Paa \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc).

The original sentence is \"If every human is asleep, then [Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel].\" So the main conditional is between the two parts.

The abbreviations are correctly used: N for human, J for asleep, P for saw, a for Alfred, O for monkey, Q for kicked, c for Hazel. The quantifiers are properly placed. The \"only if\" is translated as an implication where the antecedent is Paa and the consequent is the negation of the existence of a monkey kicking Hazel. Yes, that seems correct.

The sentence is \"Not all humans chased Lewis only if every monkey saw Lewis.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure seems to be \"Not all humans chased Lewis only if every monkey saw Lewis.\" The phrase \"only if\" typically sets up a conditional where the consequent is necessary for the antecedent. So, in logical terms, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the antecedent is \"Not all humans chased Lewis,\" and the consequent is \"every monkey saw Lewis.\"\n\nLet me rephrase the sentence: The statement is saying that if it's not the case that all humans chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis. Wait, no\u2014actually, the \"only if\" structure would mean that the entire \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" is the antecedent, and \"every monkey saw Lewis\" is the necessary condition. So the correct translation would be \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" \u2192 \"every monkey saw Lewis.\"\n\nNow, let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst part: \"Not all humans chased Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"All humans chased Lewis\" would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb). So \"Not all\" is the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb). Alternatively, this can be written as \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb), which means there exists at least one human who did not chase Lewis. But I need to check which form is more appropriate here. Since the original uses \"not all,\" maybe it's better to stick with the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nSecond part: \"Every monkey saw Lewis.\" That's straightforward: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb).\n\nPutting it together with the implication from the \"only if\": The entire statement is \"If not all humans chased Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis.\" So the formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb).\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the \"only if\" direction. The structure \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So here, A is \"Not all humans chased Lewis,\" and B is \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" So yes, the implication is from A to B. Therefore, the translation is correct as above.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the existential form for \"not all,\" then \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) is equivalent to \u2203x (Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). But the problem allows using the abbreviations as given, so I should use the form that directly corresponds. Since the original is \"not all,\" using the negation of the universal is acceptable.\n\nSo the final formula would be \u00ac\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb). Let me check the abbreviations again to ensure I'm using the right symbols:\n\nN: [1] is a human \u2013 correct.\nR: [1] chased [2] \u2013 so Rxb where x is the chaser and b (Lewis) is the chasee.

So if we have \"a human chased Hazel\" as P, and \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" as Q, then it becomes P \u2192 Q. \n\nBreaking down \"a human chased Hazel\": \"a human\" implies existence, so \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryc). Here, N is \"[1] is a human,\" and R is the chasing relation. \n\nThen \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" is \u00acQ(a, c), since Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\" and Alfred is 'a', Hazel is 'c'. So that part is \u00acQac.\n\nPutting that together, the \"only if\" part becomes (\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryc)) \u2192 \u00acQac. Wait, no. Wait, the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"a human chased Hazel\" being the antecedent. So the structure is: If (every monkey chased Hazel), then [ (human chased Hazel) \u2192 (\u00acAlfred kicked Hazel) ].\n\nSo the entire implication is: [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc)] \u2192 [ (\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryc)) \u2192 \u00acQac ].\n\nBut in logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes implications can be converted using the equivalence A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to return a well-formed formula in standard syntax, so I need to represent it as is.\n\nSo the main connective is the implication between the two parts. The antecedent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc), and the consequent is (\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryc) \u2192 \u00acQac). \n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the formalization would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryc) \u2192 \u00acQac)\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Let's verify each part again. \n\nOriginal sentence: If A, then (B only if C). Where A is \"every monkey chased Hazel,\" B is \"a human chased Hazel,\" and C is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" \n\n\"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. So the whole sentence is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Which is the same as what I have. \n\nYes, that seems right. Also, the abbreviations are used correctly. O for monkey, R for chased with c (Hazel) as the second argument. N for human, Q for kicked with a (Alfred) and c (Hazel) as arguments. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just write it in the proper symbols. The formula uses \u2200, \u2203, \u2192, \u2227, \u00ac. All the abbreviations are properly applied. The variables x and y are used appropriately. \n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(\u2203y(Ny\u2227Ryc)\u2192\u00acQac)\n\nI need to make sure there are no typos and that the parentheses are correctly placed. The main implication is between the universal quantifier statement and the implication of the existential and the negation. The parentheses group the consequent properly. Yes, that looks correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(\u2203y(Ny\u2227Ryc)\u2192\u00acQac)",

The first part is \"Alfred isn't hungry.\" The abbreviations provided are L for \"[1] is hungry\" and a for Alfred. So, \"Alfred is hungry\" would be La. But since it's \"isn't hungry,\" that should be the negation of La, so \u00acLa.\n\nThen there's \"but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\" The word \"but\" here is a conjunction, which in logic is usually translated as \u2227 (and).

The negation of that would be \u00acMb.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is saying two things: Alfred isn't hungry (\u00acLa) and Lewis isn't a donkey (\u00acMb).

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The main structure is a conditional: \"If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the components. The antecedent of the main conditional is \"Alfred won't attack,\" which translates to \u00acG(a) using the abbreviation G for \"will attack\" and a for Alfred.\n\nThe consequent is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" here is crucial. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. But here, the structure is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\" So, the \"only if\" connects two parts: the first part is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" and the second part is \"every human saw Hazel.\" \n\nSo, the consequent can be seen as: If (not all donkeys kicked Alfred), then (every human saw Hazel). Wait, no\u2014the \"only if\" reverses that. Normally, \"A only if B\" means A \u2192 B. So if the structure is \"A only if B,\" then A is the antecedent and B is the consequent. \n\nIn this case, the original phrase is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\" So, \"A\" here is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" and \"B\" is \"every human saw Hazel.\" So this translates to A \u2192 B, where A is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" and B is \"every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nBut let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst, \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" The statement \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)), since M is \"[1] is a donkey\" and Q is \"[1] kicked [2].\" Therefore, \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)). Alternatively, this can be written as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) using the negation of a universal quantifier.\n\nThen, \"every human saw Hazel\" is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)), since N is \"[1] is a human\" and P is \"[1] saw [2],\" and c is Hazel.\n\nPutting the \"only if\" together, the consequent becomes \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nSo the entire original sentence is: If \u00acG(a), then [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c))]. \n\nBut wait, the original structure is \"If Alfred won't attack, then [not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel].\" Which we've translated as \u00acG(a) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c))]. \n\nHowever, in logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if the structure is correct. The main conditional is the \"if...then...\" which is \u00acG(a) \u2192 (A \u2192 B), where A is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) and B is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)). \n\nAlternatively, using material implication, we can note that A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. But I think the correct way here is to keep it as an implication. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications are right-associative, so this is acceptable. Alternatively, we can use parentheses to make it clear. However, the problem requires a single well-formed formula, so this should be okay.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" can also be expressed as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)). So maybe the consequent's antecedent could be written as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)). Let me check if that's equivalent. Yes, because \u00ac\u2200x (P \u2192 Q) is equivalent to \u2203x (P \u2227 \u00acQ). So substituting, we can write the consequent's antecedent as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)).\n\nTherefore, the consequent becomes \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nSo the entire formula can also be written as:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)))\n\nBut both forms are logically equivalent. The problem doesn't specify whether to use the negation of a universal or the existential form, so either is acceptable. However, perhaps using the existential quantifier is more straightforward here. Let me verify.\n\nOriginal consequent: \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nSo \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is the antecedent of the \"only if\" implication. So the structure is: (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a))) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)). \n\nAlternatively, using the existential form: \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)). \n\nEither way, the overall structure is the same. So I can choose either. Let's go with the existential form for clarity.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, in formal logic, the implication operator is right-associative, so A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is the same as (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. Wait, no. A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is logically equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So perhaps we can rewrite the formula as (\u00acG(a) \u2227 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a))) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)). \n\nBut the original structure is an implication where the antecedent is \u00acG(a) and the consequent is another implication. However, depending on how the problem is phrased, both forms are correct. However, the problem states that the sentence is \"If Alfred won't attack, then [not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every human saw Hazel].\" So the main connective is the first \"if...then...\", and the \"only if\" is inside the consequent. Therefore, the correct formalization would be \u00acG(a) \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Q(x,a))) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)) ].\n\nAlternatively, using the existential form:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 [ \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)) ]\n\nBut in terms of standard syntax, we need to make sure that the parentheses are correctly placed. So the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)) )\n\nThis is a valid well-formed formula. However, another way to write this is to recognize that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. Therefore, the formula can also be written as (\u00acG(a) \u2227 \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a))) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nBut does the original sentence support this equivalence? Let's think. The original sentence is: If Alfred won't attack, then [ (not all donkeys kicked Alfred) only if (every human saw Hazel) ]. The \"only if\" here is part of the consequent. So the structure is: If A, then (B only if C), which is If A, then (B \u2192 C). So the entire formula is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Which is logically equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. However, depending on the problem's requirements, either form is acceptable. But since the problem asks for a direct translation, perhaps we should stick to the structure as per the sentence, which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C).\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)) )\n\nNow, checking the abbreviations again:\n\nG: [1] will attack \u2192 G(a) is \"Alfred will attack\", so \u00acG(a) is correct.\n\nM: [1] is a donkey \u2192 Mx.\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2] \u2192 Q(x,a) means x kicked Alfred.\n\nN: [1] is a human \u2192 Nx.\n\nP: [1] saw [2] \u2192 P(x,c) means x saw Hazel (c is Hazel).\n\nYes, all abbreviations are correctly used.\n\nNow, let's ensure that the logical structure is correct. The sentence says that if Alfred doesn't attack, then the fact that not all donkeys kicked him is only possible if every human saw Hazel. So, whenever Alfred doesn't attack, then if there exists a donkey that didn't kick him, that implies every human saw Hazel. Which aligns with the formalization.\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 P(x,c)))\n\nThis is a well-formed formula in predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n</think>\n\n\u00acG(a)\u2192(\u2203x(Mx\u2227\u00acQ(x,a))\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192P(x,c)))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is: \"A donkey kicked Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are M for donkey, Q for kicked, b is Lewis, N for human, and c is Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main part is \"A donkey kicked Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" usually introduces a necessary condition. So, if we have \"P only if Q,\" that translates to P \u2192 Q. So in this case, the existence of a donkey kicking Lewis (P) is only possible if it's not the case that all humans kicked Hazel (Q). \n\nSo the first part is \"A donkey kicked Lewis,\" which would be an existential statement. There exists some x such that M(x) (x is a donkey) and Q(x, b) (x kicked Lewis). So \u2203x(Mx \u2227 Qxb).\n\nThen the \"only if\" part leads to the necessary condition: \u00ac\u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyc). Wait, \"not all humans kicked Hazel\" translates to \"It is not the case that for all humans y, y kicked Hazel.\" So that's the negation of a universal statement. The universal statement would be \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyc), so the negation is \u00ac\u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyc). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203y(Ny \u2227 \u00acQyc), but since the original uses \"not all,\" maybe we should stick with the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is: If there is a donkey that kicked Lewis, then it is not the case that all humans kicked Hazel. So the implication would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 Qxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyc).\n\nWait, but the original sentence is \"A donkey kicked Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\" So the structure is \"A donkey kicked Lewis only if [condition].\" So the \"only if\" means that the condition is necessary for the donkey kicking. Therefore, the correct translation is that if a donkey kicked Lewis, then the condition must hold. So yes, the implication is from the existence of the donkey kicking to the negation of the universal statement.\n\nSo the final formula should be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 Qxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyc). Let me check if I used all abbreviations correctly. M is for donkey, Q is kicked, b is Lewis, N is human, c is Hazel. Yes, that seems right. I don't think I need to use any other symbols. Also, the quantifiers are properly used: existential for the donkey and universal (negated) for the humans. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Qxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(Ny \u2192 Qyc)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The abbreviations provided are G for \"will attack\", a for Alfred, M for \"is a donkey\", P for \"saw\", c for Hazel, and I for \"ate\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence into its logical components. The main structure seems to be a conditional: If [Alfred won't attack], then [not all donkeys saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate]. \n\nBreaking down the antecedent: \"Alfred won't attack\" translates to \u00acG(a). \n\nThe consequent is a bit more complex: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So, if we let A be \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" and B be \"no donkeys ate\", then the consequent would be A \u2192 B. \n\nBut let's confirm that. The original consequent is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" So \"only if\" sets up a condition where the truth of the first part (not all donkeys saw Hazel) depends on the second part (no donkeys ate). So yes, it should be \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate.\" Wait, no. Wait, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So if the statement is \"A only if B\", then the translation is A \u2192 B. So in this case, A is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\", and B is \"no donkeys ate\". Therefore, the consequent is (\u00ac\u2200 donkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (no donkeys ate). \n\nBut let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst, \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\". The statement \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)). Therefore, \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x,c)), but maybe we should keep it as the negation of the universal quantifier for accuracy here.\n\nThen, \"no donkeys ate\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix), which is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). \n\nSo putting the consequent together: \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). \n\nAlternatively, using the equivalent forms, but I think the problem expects us to use the abbreviations directly. \n\nTherefore, the entire implication is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix)].\n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"If Alfred won't attack, then [not all donkeys saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate]\". So the structure is: If \u00acG(a), then (\u00ac\u2200... \u2192 \u00ac\u2203...). \n\nBut let me check if there's another way to parse the original sentence. The phrase \"only if\" can sometimes be confusing. Let me rephrase the original consequent: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" This can be read as \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then it must be that no donkeys ate.\" Which is the same as A \u2192 B where A is \"not all...\" and B is \"no...\".\n\nSo combining everything, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut we can simplify the consequent implication. Let me note that in logic, an implication of implications can be handled by associating the arrows properly. However, the problem is that the consequent is itself an implication. So the entire formula is a conditional where the antecedent is \u00acG(a) and the consequent is another implication. \n\nAlternatively, using logical equivalences, we can rewrite implications. But the problem requires just translating into predicate logic, not simplifying. So perhaps we need to present it as is.\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations again to make sure we're using them correctly. \n\nG is \"[1] will attack\", so G(a) is \"Alfred will attack\". The antecedent is \"Alfred won't attack\", so that's \u00acG(a). \n\nM is \"[1] is a donkey\", so Mx for x being a donkey. \n\nP is \"[1] saw [2]\", so P(x,c) is \"x saw Hazel\". \n\nI is \"[1] ate\", so Ix is \"x ate\". \n\nSo the \"no donkeys ate\" is indeed \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). \n\nPutting it all together, the formalization is:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut in predicate logic, we need to make sure that the quantifiers and connectives are properly nested. Let me check if there are any parentheses issues. \n\nYes, the structure is correct. The outer implication is \u00acG(a) leading to the inner implication. \n\nAlternatively, we can also write the inner implication as \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). \n\nBut perhaps we can also express the inner implication using the contrapositive. The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. So if we take the inner implication \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix), its contrapositive would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)). However, the original problem requires translating the given sentence, not simplifying, so we should stick with the original structure.\n\nAnother thing to consider: sometimes \"only if\" can be tricky. Let me confirm once again. The phrase \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So in the sentence, \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel only if no donkeys ate\", that would be \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then no donkeys ate.\" Which is exactly what we have. \n\nTherefore, the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nNow, let's check if there's a way to write this without using the implication in the consequent. However, the problem doesn't require that; it just wants the direct translation. \n\nSo the answer should be as above. Let me just write it with proper parentheses and symbols.\n\nSo, in symbols:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))\n\nBut since variables can be reused (as long as they are bound correctly), it's okay to have x and y, but perhaps the problem expects the same variable. However, in predicate logic, the variables in different quantifiers can be different, but it's not necessary here. For example, the inner implication's second part is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix), so using x again is acceptable. \n\nSo the formula can be written as:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nThis is acceptable because the x in the existential is bound within its own scope. \n\nTherefore, the final formalization is:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nAlternatively, since implications can be nested, but we need to ensure correct parentheses. \n\nYes, that's the correct structure.\n</think>\n\n\u00acG(a)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c))\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227I(x)))",

The sentence is \"Every human drank if and only if not all donkeys ate.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"is a human,\" H for \"drank,\" M for \"is a donkey,\" and I for \"ate.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The main structure is a biconditional (if and only if) between two parts: \"Every human drank\" and \"not all donkeys ate.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Every human drank.\" Using the abbreviations, N(x) would represent x is a human, and H(x) is x drank. So, this part would translate to \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 H(x)). That makes sense because for all x, if x is a human, then x drank.\n\nNow the second part: \"not all donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"all donkeys ate\" would be \u2200y (M(y) \u2192 I(y)), meaning for all y, if y is a donkey, then y ate. But since it's \"not all,\" we need to negate that. So \u00ac\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 I(y)). Alternatively, in logic, the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential quantifier with the negated inner part. So \u00ac\u2200y (M(y)\u2192I(y)) is equivalent to \u2203y (M(y) \u2227 \u00acI(y)). But I think the problem might accept either form, but perhaps the direct negation is better here unless specified otherwise. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided and standard syntax. The user's example used the universal quantifier with implication, so maybe we should stick with the negated universal form here. \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire sentence is a biconditional between the first part and the second part. That would be:\n\n\u2200x (N(x) \u2192 H(x)) \u2194 \u00ac\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 I(y))\n\nBut I need to check variables. Since the two quantifiers use different variables (x and y), that's okay. Alternatively, maybe they can use the same variable, but since they are in different scopes, different variables are better to avoid confusion. \n\nSo the final formula should be \u2200x(Nx\u2192Hx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Iy). \n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check. The original sentence says that the condition for every human having drunk is exactly when it's not the case that all donkeys ate. So the biconditional connects the two statements. Yes, that seems right. \n\nI don't see any other abbreviations needed here. All the predicates are covered by N, H, M, I. No need for additional symbols. Also, the logical symbols are properly used with the quantifiers and connectives. The biconditional is between the universal statement about humans and the negation of the universal statement about donkeys. \n\nI think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Hx)\u2194\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Iy)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" The abbreviations provided are M for donkey, P for saw, c for Hazel, N for human, R for chased, Q for kicked, and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" So A is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel,\" and B is \"a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)). The negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)). Alternatively, using the equivalence between \u00ac\u2200 and \u2203\u00ac, this becomes \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x, c)). Either form is correct, but maybe the second is more standard for such translations.\n\nNow for B: \"a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So if we have \"A human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Alfred,\" that becomes: If a human chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Alfred. Let's formalize that.\n\n\"A human chased Hazel\" would be \u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y, c)). But since the \"only if\" is about the entire statement, the implication is that if there exists a human who chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Alfred. Wait, but the original says \"a human chased Hazel only if...\" So it's saying that whenever a human does chase Hazel, then Q(c, a) must hold. Wait, but the structure is \"If [human chased Hazel], then [Hazel kicked Alfred].\" However, \"a human chased Hazel\" could be read as an existential statement. But since the consequent is a universal condition (Hazel kicked Alfred), the implication would be that if there exists such a human, then Q(c,a). So B is \u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y, c)) \u2192 Q(c, a).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is A \u2192 B, where A is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) and B is \u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y,c)) \u2192 Q(c,a). Alternatively, using the existential form for A: \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x,c)) \u2192 [\u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y,c)) \u2192 Q(c,a)].\n\nBut wait, how do we structure the implication? The main connective is the conditional between A and B. So the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 [\u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y,c)) \u2192 Q(c,a)]\n\nAlternatively, using the existential version for A:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x,c)) \u2192 [\u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y,c)) \u2192 Q(c,a)]\n\nEither way is acceptable, but maybe the first is more direct since the original says \"not all donkeys saw Hazel,\" which directly negates the universal. However, in predicate logic, it's often preferable to push the negation inside, so maybe using \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x,c)) is better.\n\nNow, considering the structure of B: \u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y,c)) \u2192 Q(c,a). This is a valid implication. However, sometimes implications with existentials can be tricky. Let me check if that's the correct translation. The statement is \"If a human chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Alfred.\" So if there's at least one human who chased Hazel, then Hazel must have kicked Alfred. So yes, that's correctly captured by \u2203y(...) \u2192 ... \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x, c)) \u2192 (\u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y, c)) \u2192 Q(c, a))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can use the equivalence that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. Maybe that's a more standard way to write it. Let me consider that. The original is: If A, then (B \u2192 C). Which is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So perhaps rewriting B as (\u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y,c)) \u2192 Q(c,a)) is the same as (\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x,c)) \u2227 \u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y,c))) \u2192 Q(c,a). But the original structure is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C), so both forms are acceptable. However, in formal logic, it's often preferred to have implications nested rather than using the equivalence unless necessary. \n\nBut given the problem's example uses material implication directly, I think the correct formalization is to keep it as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Therefore, the formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x, c)) \u2192 (\u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y, c)) \u2192 Q(c, a))\n\nNow, let me check if there's any other aspect I might have missed. The sentence says \"a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" The \"only if\" does indeed translate to the implication where the antecedent is the \"human chased Hazel\" and the consequent is \"Hazel kicked Alfred.\" So that part seems right.\n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations. The saw relation is P, which is [1] saw [2], so P(x,c) is correct. The chased relation R is [1] chased [2], so R(y,c). Kicked Q is [1] kicked [2], so Q(c,a) because Hazel (c) kicked Alfred (a). All correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the final formula should be:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x, c)) \u2192 (\u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y, c)) \u2192 Q(c, a))\n\nBut to make sure there's no confusion with parentheses, perhaps adding more parentheses for clarity. However, in standard syntax, the implication is right-associative, so A \u2192 B \u2192 C is parsed as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). But to be explicit, we can write it with parentheses as above.\n\nYes, this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x,c)) \u2192 (\u2203y(Ny \u2227 R(y,c)) \u2192 Q(c,a))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviations provided are G for \"will attack\", a for Alfred, O for \"is a monkey\", P for \"saw\", c for Hazel, Q for \"kicked\", and b for Lewis.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If Alfred won't attack, then...\" which translates to \u00acGa \u2192 ... (since G is \"will attack\", so \u00acGa means Alfred won't attack). \n\nThe consequent is a bit more complex: \"every monkey saw Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So, if we have \"every monkey saw Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis,\" it's like saying that if every monkey saw Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis. Wait, but the original sentence is structured as \"every monkey saw Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nThe \"only if\" here is connecting two statements: \"every monkey saw Hazel\" and \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So the structure is: (Every monkey saw Hazel) only if (Every monkey kicked Lewis). Translating \"only if\" as an implication, this would be (Every monkey saw Hazel) \u2192 (Every monkey kicked Lewis). But wait, \"only if\" can sometimes invert the implication. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" is logically equivalent to A \u2192 B. So if the statement is \"A only if B\", then it's A \u2192 B. So in this case, the antecedent is \"every monkey saw Hazel\", and the consequent is \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So the implication would be that if every monkey saw Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\nBut let me check the original sentence again. The sentence says \"every monkey saw Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So, according to the \"only if\" rule, this would be equivalent to: For every monkey, if they saw Hazel, then they kicked Lewis. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the scope here. The original statement is about all monkeys. So perhaps the correct way is that the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is the A in \"A only if B\", where B is \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So the implication would be that if every monkey saw Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis. So that would be (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb)). \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire sentence is \u00acGa \u2192 [ (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb)) ].\n\nWait, but the original sentence is \"If Alfred won't attack, then [every monkey saw Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis].\" So the consequent is the implication between the two universal statements. Therefore, the formalization would be \u00acGa \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)) )\n\nBut maybe there's a way to simplify this. Alternatively, could the \"only if\" be interpreted as a biconditional? Probably not. \"Only if\" is typically a one-way implication. For example, \"I can go to the party only if I finish my homework\" means that if I go to the party, then I must have finished my homework. It doesn't mean that if I finish my homework, I can go to the party. So the implication is from the event (going to the party) to the condition (finishing homework). So in this case, \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is the event, and \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is the condition. So the implication is that if every monkey saw Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis. So the consequent is indeed the implication between those two universal statements.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is: \u00acGa \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)) )\n\nAlternatively, could the \"only if\" be inside the universal quantifier? Let me think again. Suppose the structure is: For every monkey, if they saw Hazel, then they kicked Lewis. That would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Pxc) \u2192 Qxb ). But that's different from the previous approach. Which one is correct?\n\nThe original sentence says \"every monkey saw Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So, if we consider \"only if\" for each individual monkey. Let's parse it. For each monkey, \"saw Hazel only if kicked Lewis.\" So for each monkey x, if x saw Hazel, then x kicked Lewis. Which would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 Qxb)). Which simplifies to \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Pxc) \u2192 Qxb ). \n\nBut the original sentence says \"every monkey saw Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" Wait, the original has \"every monkey saw Hazel\" as a single condition. So perhaps the \"only if\" is between two universal statements. So the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is the antecedent, and the entire \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is the consequent. So the implication is that if every monkey saw Hazel, then every monkey kicked Lewis. \n\nBut which interpretation is correct? The sentence is a bit ambiguous. Let's look at the wording again: \"every monkey saw Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The structure is similar to \"Every A is B only if every C is D.\" Which would translate to (For all A, B) \u2192 (For all C, D). So in this case, (For all x, if Ox then Pxc) \u2192 (For all x, if Ox then Qxb). \n\nAlternatively, if the \"only if\" were per monkey, it would be phrased as \"Every monkey saw Hazel only if he kicked Lewis,\" which would be the per-monkey implication. But the original sentence uses \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" as the condition. So the correct approach is probably the first one: the implication between the two universal statements.\n\nTherefore, the formalization would be:\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes it's better to combine the quantifiers. Let me check if there's a way to simplify. For example, the implication between two universals can be expressed as a universal implication. Wait, (\u2200x A) \u2192 (\u2200x B) is not equivalent to \u2200x (A \u2192 B). For example, suppose A is true for some x and false for others, and B is always true. Then (\u2200x A) would be false, so the implication would be true. But \u2200x (A \u2192 B) would be true because whenever A is true, B is true. But if (\u2200x A) is false, then the implication holds regardless. However, they are not equivalent. So in this case, the original sentence requires that if all monkeys saw Hazel, then all monkeys kicked Lewis. So the structure is indeed an implication between two universal statements. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is as above. \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can use different variables for each quantifier if needed, but since both are over x, it's okay. Also, the two universal quantifiers can be written with the same variable because they are in different scopes. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)) )\n\nBut to make sure, let me check if there's a way to combine the quantifiers or if there's any alternative. For example, perhaps the inner implications can be merged. However, I don't think so. The structure is a conditional where the antecedent is a universal statement and the consequent is another universal statement. So the correct way is to have the implication between them.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxc)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is \"Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy.\" And the abbreviations are given. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main parts are \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" and \"every donkey is happy.\" The word \"unless\" usually translates to a logical implication. In logic, \"A unless B\" is often equivalent to \"If not B, then A\" or \"B or A.\" So here, the sentence is saying that if it's not the case that every donkey is happy, then not all humans chased Lewis. Alternatively, it could be phrased as \"every donkey is happy or not all humans chased Lewis.\"\n\nLet me recall the standard translation for \"unless.\" Typically, \"A unless B\" becomes B \u2228 A. But sometimes it's \u00acB \u2192 A. Wait, which is correct here? Let me think. If the sentence is \"Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy,\" then the structure is \"A unless B,\" where A is \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" and B is \"every donkey is happy.\" So according to the usual translation, this would be B \u2228 A. So that would be \"Every donkey is happy OR not all humans chased Lewis.\"\n\nAlternatively, using implication: if not B, then A. So \u00acB \u2192 A. Let me check if these are equivalent. B \u2228 A is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. Yes, because \u00acB \u2192 A is equivalent to B \u2228 A. So both forms are acceptable. Depending on how we structure the formula, either approach works.\n\nNow, let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst, \"every donkey is happy\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx). Because for all x, if x is a donkey (Mx), then x is happy (Kx).\n\nNext, \"Not all humans chased Lewis.\" The statement \"all humans chased Lewis\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). Because for all x, if x is a human (Nx), then x chased b (Lewis). The negation of that would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). However, in predicate logic, the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential quantifier with the negated inner part. So \u00ac\u2200x(Px) is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00acPx). Therefore, \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb) becomes \u2203x(\u00ac(Nx \u2192 Rxb)). But the implication Nx \u2192 Rxb is equivalent to \u00acNx \u2228 Rxb. The negation of that is Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb. So \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's clearer to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(...). But the problem is to use the abbreviations given. Let me check: the abbreviations are N for human, R for chased, b for Lewis, M for donkey, K for happy. So I need to represent \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" as \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). \n\nPutting it all together. The original sentence is \"Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy.\" Using the \"A unless B\" structure, which is B \u2228 A. So the formula would be [\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx)] \u2228 [\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb)]. Alternatively, using implication, it would be \u00ac[\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx)] \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb)? Wait, no. Wait, if \"A unless B\" is \u00acB \u2192 A. So if B is \"every donkey is happy\", then \u00acB would be \"not every donkey is happy\", which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx). So then the implication would be: if \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx), then \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). Which is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). \n\nBut which form is better? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, and the example uses universal quantifiers. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So when they have \"all X do Y\", it's a universal. When they negate it, like \"Not all X do Y\", they would use \u00ac\u2200x(...) which can be written as \u2203x(...). \n\nSo for the original sentence, the structure is \"Not all H did C unless all D are H.\" So the two options are:\n\nEither B \u2228 A, where B is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) and A is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). So the entire formula would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nAlternatively, using implication: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). Wait, but that would be the contrapositive? Wait, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"if not B then A\". So if A is \"Not all...\", then it's \u00acB \u2192 A. Here, B is \"every donkey is happy\", so \u00acB is \"not every donkey is happy\", which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx). So the implication would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). Which is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). \n\nBut which of these forms is more standard? The problem allows either, but perhaps the first approach (B \u2228 A) is more straightforward. Let me think about the example again. The example used a universal quantifier. So maybe the answer expects the \"unless\" to be translated as a disjunction. \n\nTherefore, the formula would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, disjunctions with quantifiers can sometimes be tricky. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nThe original sentence: Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy. \n\nSo if every donkey is happy (B), then the condition is satisfied regardless of whether all humans chased Lewis. If B is not true, then the \"unless\" condition fails, so A (Not all...) must hold. \n\nSo the correct translation would be B \u2228 A, which is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nAlternatively, since in logic, disjunction can be used with quantifiers, but sometimes it's preferable to have the quantifiers at the front. However, in this case, since both B and A are quantified statements, their disjunction is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, another way to write this is to use material implication. Since B \u2228 A is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. So another way to write the same thing is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). But which one is better? \n\nThe problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are correct, but perhaps the first approach (disjunction) is more direct. However, in formal logic, sometimes implications are preferred. Let me check if there's a standard way. \n\nIn the example, the translation used implication inside the universal quantifier. But for the \"unless\" case, using disjunction between two quantified statements is acceptable. \n\nBut let me also think about the scope. The original sentence is \"Not all H... unless all D...\" So the correct structure is that either all D are happy, or it's not the case that all H chased Lewis. \n\nTherefore, the formula should be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nBut perhaps we can write it as \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). Since disjunction is commutative. \n\nYes. So that's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to rephrase the original sentence. \"Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy.\" This can be rephrased as \"If it is not the case that every donkey is happy, then not all humans chased Lewis.\" Which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nBut here, the antecedent \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx). And the consequent \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb) is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). So the implication becomes \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). \n\nBut which form is better? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Let's check the abbreviations again:\n\n- N: \"[1] is a human\"\n- R: \"[1] chased [2]\"\n- b: \"Lewis\"\n- M: \"[1] is a donkey\"\n- K: \"[1] is happy\"\n\nSo for the first part, \"every donkey is happy\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\n\"Not all humans chased Lewis\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). \n\nSo if we take the \"unless\" as B \u2228 A, then the formula is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nBut in predicate logic, when you have a disjunction of two statements with quantifiers, it's acceptable. However, sometimes it's preferable to have all quantifiers at the beginning, but that's not always possible. \n\nAlternatively, using implication: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nBut both forms are logically equivalent. However, the problem example uses a universal quantifier with implication. Let me check if there's a standard way to present this. \n\nIn formal logic, both forms are acceptable. But perhaps the problem expects one of them. Let me think about the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So in that case, the universal quantifier is used. \n\nBut in the current problem, the sentence is more complex. Let me check if there's any other way. \n\nAnother approach: \"Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy.\" This can be rephrased as \"If not every donkey is happy, then not all humans chased Lewis.\" Which is equivalent to: If there exists a donkey that is not happy, then there exists a human who did not chase Lewis. \n\nWhich would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). \n\nBut this is another valid translation. However, the problem allows using the abbreviations given. The user didn't specify whether to push the negation inside or keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(...). \n\nThe problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations for \"chased\" is R: [1] chased [2]. So Rxb would be \"[1] chased b (Lewis)\". \n\nSo for \"Not all humans chased Lewis\", using the abbreviation, it's \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxb). \n\nSo if we take the \"unless\" as B \u2228 A, then the formula is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nBut in predicate logic, this is a valid formula. However, sometimes in formal logic, it's preferable to have all quantifiers at the front. But here, since we have a disjunction between two quantified formulas, that's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, if we use the implication form, we can write it as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nBut both forms are logically equivalent. \n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are correct. However, the example uses a universal quantifier with implication. Let me check the example again. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So in that case, the universal quantifier is used. \n\nBut for the current problem, the sentence is a disjunction between two statements. So perhaps the answer is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the implication form. Let me think again. \n\nIn logic, \"A unless B\" is usually translated as B \u2228 A, which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. Both are correct. The example in the problem uses implication inside a universal quantifier. \n\nBut in this case, the main connective is a disjunction between two quantified statements. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible mistake here. \n\nWait, the original sentence is \"Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy.\" \n\nSo \"unless\" can be tricky. Let me think of a simple example. \n\nSuppose I say \"I will go to the party unless it rains.\" This means \"If it rains, I won't go\" or \"I will go unless it rains.\" Wait, actually, it's more like \"If it doesn't rain, I will go.\" Or maybe \"I will go unless it rains\" is equivalent to \"I will go if it doesn't rain.\" So \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A if not B\", which is \u00acB \u2192 A. \n\nSo in our case, \"Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy\" translates to \"If not every donkey is happy, then not all humans chased Lewis.\" Which is \u00acB \u2192 A, where B is \"every donkey is happy\" and A is \"not all humans chased Lewis.\" \n\nSo \u00acB is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx), which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx). \n\nAnd A is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb), which is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). \n\nSo the implication would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb). \n\nBut this is another valid translation. \n\nNow, comparing the two possible translations:\n\nOption 1: \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb)\n\nOption 2: \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acKx) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acRxb)\n\nAre they equivalent? Let's see. \n\nOption 1: B \u2228 A, where B is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx), and A is \u00ac\u2200x(...). \n\nOption 2: \u00acB \u2192 A. Which is equivalent to B \u2228 A. Yes, because in propositional logic, \u00acB \u2192 A is equivalent to B \u2228 A. \n\nSo both are equivalent. \n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations don't include the existential quantifier form, but the user allows using standard logical symbols like \u2203 and \u2200. \n\nSo which form is better? \n\nThe example uses universal quantifiers, but here, the choice depends on how to express the implication. \n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the first form, with the disjunction between the two quantified statements. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might prefer the implication form. \n\nBut how to decide? Let me think about the structure of the original sentence. \n\nThe original sentence is \"Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy.\" \n\nThe \"unless\" introduces a condition that if not met, the first part must hold. \n\nSo in logical terms, it's equivalent to \"If not (every donkey is happy), then not all humans chased Lewis.\" \n\nWhich is the implication form. \n\nBut since the two forms are equivalent, either is acceptable. \n\nHowever, in formal logic, sometimes implications are preferred when dealing with conditionals. \n\nBut the problem example uses a universal quantifier with implication. \n\nBut perhaps the answer should use the disjunction form. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to use the negation of the universal quantifier. \n\nBut I need to choose one. \n\nLet me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So when the sentence is a universal statement, they use the universal quantifier. \n\nIn our problem, the sentence is a disjunction between a universal statement and a negated universal. \n\nSo the formula would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nAlternatively, if written as an implication, it would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nBut which is more standard? \n\nIn formal logic, both are acceptable. However, the problem might expect the disjunction form because it's a direct translation of \"A unless B\" as B \u2228 A. \n\nSo I'll go with the disjunction form. \n\nThus, the final formula is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nBut let me verify this once more. \n\nOriginal sentence: Not all humans chased Lewis unless every donkey is happy. \n\nWhich is equivalent to: Either every donkey is happy, or not all humans chased Lewis. \n\nYes. So that's exactly B \u2228 A. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nAlternatively, since the order in disjunction doesn't matter, it could also be written as \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). \n\nBut in standard logic notation, the order might not matter, but the problem example uses the implication in a certain order. \n\nSo I think this is the correct answer. Let me check if there are any other possible errors. \n\nWait, the abbreviations for R are [1] chased [2]. So Rxb is \"[1] chased [2]\", where [1] is the subject and [2] is the object. So for \"humans chased Lewis\", the subject is the human (Nx), and the object is Lewis (b). So Rxb is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the final formula is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb). \n\nAlternatively, using the implication form, but as discussed, both are equivalent. However, the problem might prefer the disjunction form. \n\nTherefore, I'll present that as the answer.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)\u2228\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this logic problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the sentence is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if no humans are hungry.\" \n\nThe abbreviations given are:\n- N: [1] is a human\n- R: [1] chased [2]\n- b: Lewis\n- Q: [1] kicked [2]\n- c: Hazel\n- a: Alfred\n- L: [1] is hungry\n\nSo, the main structure here is a conditional statement. The first part is \"If a human chased Lewis,\" which translates to an existential quantifier, right? Because \"a human\" implies there exists at least one human. So that part would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). Wait, but sometimes \"a human\" could be treated as an existential. So the antecedent of the main conditional is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb).\n\nThen the consequent is \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if no humans are hungry.\" The \"only if\" part is important. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the \"Hazel kicked Alfred\" is Qca (since Hazel is c, Alfred is a), and the \"no humans are hungry\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx), or equivalently \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Wait, both are equivalent. But maybe the former is better here.\n\nSo putting that together, the consequent would be Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx). \n\nSo the entire statement would be: If \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), then (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx)). \n\nSo in logical terms, that's:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx))\n\nBut maybe we can simplify the quantifiers. Let me check. The \"no humans are hungry\" is indeed the same as \"for all humans, they are not hungry,\" so \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Either form is acceptable, but the problem didn't specify which to use. Let me see which one is more standard. Since the example used universal quantifier for \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" maybe using universal here is okay. However, in this case, since the original uses \"no humans are hungry,\" maybe the negation of existence is more direct. But both are correct. Let me check the example again. The example used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So perhaps the universal form is preferred here. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. Wait, the abbreviations for L is \"[1] is hungry,\" so the negation would be \u00acLx. So \"no humans are hungry\" would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Alternatively, \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx). Either way, but maybe the problem expects one or the other. Let me think. Since the example used a universal quantifier for a similar structure, maybe here the same applies. Let me rephrase the consequent as Qca \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). \n\nBut the original sentence says \"only if no humans are hungry.\" So the \"no humans are hungry\" is the condition that must hold for Hazel kicking Alfred. Therefore, the structure is: If (a human chased Lewis), then (if Hazel kicked Alfred, then no humans are hungry). \n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nAlternatively, using the existential negation:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx))\n\nWhich one is better? Both are logically equivalent. But maybe the problem expects the use of the abbreviations in a certain way. Let me check the abbreviations again. The L is \"[1] is hungry,\" so to express that no humans are hungry, we need to say that for all humans, they are not hungry. So \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Alternatively, \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx). Either is acceptable, but perhaps the problem expects the use of the negation of the existential. However, since the example used a universal quantifier, maybe the same applies here. Wait, the example's \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So for \"no humans are hungry,\" which is \"it is not the case that there exists a human who is hungry,\" so \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx). Alternatively, \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Both are correct. Which one to use? Let's see. The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations for L is \"[1] is hungry,\" so using the existential negation would involve combining N and L. So perhaps \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx) is more direct here. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Lx))\n\nBut we need to make sure that the variables are properly quantified. Also, note that in the antecedent, the \u2203x is for the first part, and in the consequent's consequent, there's another \u00ac\u2203x. Since variables can be reused with different scopes, that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion with variable reuse, perhaps we should use different variables, but in predicate logic, as long as the quantifiers are properly scoped, it's acceptable. For example, the x in the antecedent is bound by \u2203x, and the x in the \u00ac\u2203x is also bound by its own quantifier. So in the formula as written, the x in \u00ac\u2203x is a separate quantifier. \n\nTherefore, the final formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx))\n\nAlternatively, if we use \u2200 instead, but I think the existential negation is more straightforward here. \n\nWait, but in the problem's example, they used a universal quantifier for \"Every linguist...\", so maybe for consistency, the answer here should use the universal. Let me think again. The \"no humans are hungry\" can be written as \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). So then the formula would be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nBut here, the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent's universal quantifier are separate. However, in formal logic, when you have nested quantifiers with the same variable, it's allowed because each quantifier binds its own scope. So this is acceptable. \n\nBut which form is more likely expected? The problem didn't specify, but since both are correct, but the example uses universal for a similar structure, perhaps using the universal here is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of the same abbreviations. Let me check the abbreviations again. The L is \"[1] is hungry,\" so to express that a human is hungry, you have Lx. Therefore, \"no humans are hungry\" is \"for all x, if Nx then not Lx,\" which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). So that's the correct way. \n\nTherefore, the consequent of the main implication is Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nBut let me check if there's any possible ambiguity. The main connective is the implication from the antecedent (there exists a human who chased Lewis) to the consequent (if Hazel kicked Alfred, then no humans are hungry). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nAlternatively, since implications can be nested, we can also write this as:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nWhich is a well-formed formula. \n\nBut let me check if there's any possible mistake. For example, maybe the \"only if\" is part of a different structure. The original sentence says \"Hazel kicked Alfred only if no humans are hungry.\" So that's Qca only if \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx). Which translates to Qca \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(...). So yes, that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is as above. \n\nAnother thing to check: the use of the existential quantifier in the antecedent. The sentence starts with \"If a human chased Lewis...\" which is an existential statement. So \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) is correct. \n\nSo I think this is the right approach. Now, I need to write this in the required syntax, using the abbreviations and logical symbols. \n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nAlternatively, the inner implication could be written with the negation. But I think this is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Qca \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))",

The sentence is: \"If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: \"If [not all humans are asleep], then [a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Hazel].\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) by moving the negation inside. But since the original is \"not all,\" maybe it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x... unless required to convert. But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax, so either form is acceptable. However, the example uses the universal quantifier with implication, so maybe I should stick with \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx).\n\nNow the consequent: \"a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" in logic usually translates to an implication where the \"only if\" part is the consequent. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. \n\nSo here, \"a human chased Lewis\" is the antecedent, and \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" is the consequent. \n\nBreaking down \"a human chased Lewis\": This is an existential statement. There exists some x such that x is a human and x chased Lewis. So \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb), since b is Lewis.\n\nThen \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" is Qcc, because Q is [1] kicked [2], and both are Hazel (c).\n\nSo putting the consequent together: (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qcc. Wait, but the original says \"a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" So the entire \"a human chased Lewis\" is the antecedent, leading to Qcc. Therefore, the consequent is the implication: if there was a human who chased Lewis, then Qcc must hold. \n\nPutting it all together, the whole sentence is: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [ (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qcc ]\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if the \"only if\" applies to the entire consequent. The original is \"then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" So the \"only if\" is part of the consequent of the main conditional. So yes, the structure is correct.\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations again. N is [1] is a human, J is [1] is asleep, R is [1] chased [2], b is Lewis, Q is [1] kicked [2], c is Hazel. All correct.\n\nSo the formalization would be: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qcc)\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes it's better to write it using the material implication. Let me make sure that the structure is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a need to use a universal quantifier in the consequent? Let me think again. The consequent is \"if a human chased Lewis, then Hazel kicked Hazel.\" Since \"a human chased Lewis\" is an existential statement, the consequent is a material implication where the antecedent is that existential. So the consequent is indeed (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qcc. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qcc)\n\nBut let me check if there's any possible misinterpretation. The original sentence is a bit complex. Another way to parse it: maybe \"a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" could be interpreted as for any human who chased Lewis, it must be that Hazel kicked Hazel. That would be \u2200x((Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qcc). But since the original says \"a human chased Lewis\", which is existential, but \"only if\" turns it into the implication where the existential is the antecedent. \n\nWait, \"only if\" usually makes the \"only if\" part the necessary condition. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if A is \"there exists a human who chased Lewis\", then B is \"Hazel kicked Hazel\". So the implication is correct as (\u2203x... ) \u2192 Qcc.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qcc)\n\nAlternatively, since implications can be rephrased, but I think this is the correct structure. Let me check if the parentheses are properly placed. The main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. The consequent is itself an implication. So yes, the parentheses are correct.\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb) \u2192 Qcc)\n\nBut in the example, they used the arrow without parentheses around the implication, but in standard syntax, parentheses are needed to group the implications properly. However, sometimes in formal logic, the arrow is right-associative, but to be safe, I should include the parentheses as I did.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb) \u2192 Qcc)\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check once more. The original sentence is \"If not all humans are asleep, then [a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Hazel].\" The \"only if\" part is correctly captured by the implication in the consequent. The \"a human chased Lewis\" is the existential, which is the antecedent of the \"only if\" implication. So yes, the structure is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192Qcc)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is: \"If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey is hungry only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into parts. The main structure is a conditional statement. The antecedent is \"Alfred won't attack,\" and the consequent is \"every monkey is hungry only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Alfred won't attack.\" The abbreviation for \"will attack\" is G, so \"Alfred won't attack\" should be \u00acG(a). That's straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent is a bit more complex. It says \"every monkey is hungry only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" Let's parse that. The phrase \"only if\" usually introduces a necessary condition. So \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So in this case, if every monkey is hungry, then it must be that not all donkeys kicked Hazel. Wait, but the structure here is \"every monkey is hungry only if [condition].\" So the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent of an implication where the consequent is the condition. Wait, no. Wait, \"only if\" reverses the direction. Let me think again. \n\nIf I have \"P only if Q,\" that translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, the statement is \"every monkey is hungry only if [not all donkeys kicked Hazel].\" Let me denote \"every monkey is hungry\" as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). The \"only if\" part would mean that this entire statement (every monkey is hungry) implies the condition. So the consequent of the main conditional (the \"if Alfred... then...\") is (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c)). Wait, because \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is equivalent to \"it is not the case that all donkeys kicked Hazel,\" which would be \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acQy c). But maybe the problem expects us to use the negation of the universal quantifier directly.\n\nPutting it all together, the main structure is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c)) ].\n\nWait, but the original sentence is \"If Alfred won't attack, then [every monkey is hungry only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel].\" So the consequent is the \"only if\" statement. So the consequent is structured as (every monkey is hungry) \u2192 (not all donkeys kicked Hazel). Therefore, the entire implication would be \u00acG(a) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c) ].\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. So the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c) )\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as \u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ), but that might not capture the \"only if\" correctly. Wait, no. The implication A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. But in this case, the consequent is an implication itself. So the structure is correct as written.\n\nLet me check again. The original sentence's consequent is \"every monkey is hungry only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" So \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent of an implication where the consequent is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" So that's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c). Then, the entire statement is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [that implication].\n\nSo putting it all together, the formula should be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c) )\n\nAlternatively, using the abbreviations correctly. Let me check the abbreviations again:\n\nG: [1] will attack \u2192 G(a) is \"Alfred will attack\", so \u00acG(a) is correct.\n\nO: [1] is a monkey \u2192 Ox means x is a monkey.\n\nL: [1] is hungry \u2192 Lx means x is hungry.\n\nM: [1] is a donkey \u2192 My.\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2] \u2192 Qy c means y kicked Hazel (since c is Hazel).\n\nSo yes, the universal quantifier for donkeys is \u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c) which means all donkeys kicked Hazel. The negation of that is \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c), which is equivalent to \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acQy c). But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax, so keeping it as \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c) is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qy c) )\n\nI need to make sure that the parentheses are correctly placed. The main implication is between \u00acG(a) and the implication inside. So the structure is correct. Also, using the quantifiers \u2200x and \u2200y as needed.\n\nI think that's the correct translation.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx)\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Qyc))",

The sentence is \"Alfred saw Lewis.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, looking at the abbreviations provided: P stands for \"[1] saw [2]\", a is Alfred, and b is Lewis. So, the structure here is that the first argument of P is the subject (Alfred), and the second argument is the object (Lewis). \n\nIn predicate logic, when we have a two-place predicate like P, we need to specify both arguments. Since the sentence is a straightforward statement without any quantifiers (like \"all\" or \"there exists\"), it should just be a simple application of the predicate with the given constants.\n\nSo Alfred is represented by 'a' and Lewis by 'b'. The action here is 'saw', which is P. Therefore, putting it all together, the formula should be Pab. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The predicate P takes two arguments. The first is the one who saw, and the second is the one who was seen. So \"Alfred saw Lewis\" translates directly to P(a, b), which in the linear notation is Pab. There are no quantifiers needed here because we're dealing with specific individuals, not variables. \n\nI don't see any need for universal or existential quantifiers here. The example given in the instructions was for \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" which used a universal quantifier. But in this case, the sentence is about two specific people, Alfred and Lewis. So it's just an atomic formula with the predicate P and the two constants a and b. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct formalization is Pab. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The instructions say to use only the given abbreviations, which I did. The logical symbols required aren't needed beyond the predicate here. So the final answer should be Pab.\n</think>\n\nPab",

The sentence is: \"If a human chased Hazel, then Lewis is hungry only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: \"If [A], then [B only if C].\" Breaking it down, the antecedent is \"a human chased Hazel,\" and the consequent is \"Lewis is hungry only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"a human chased Hazel.\" The abbreviation for \"is a human\" is N, and \"chased\" is R. Since it's \"a human,\" that implies there exists at least one human who chased Hazel. So this part would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc), where c is Hazel.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Lewis is hungry only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, \"Lewis is hungry\" (which is Lb, since b is Lewis) only if \"no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" part is a universal statement. Since O is \"is a monkey\" and Q is \"kicked,\" we need to say that for all x, if x is a monkey, then x did not kick Hazel. That would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). \n\nPutting the consequent together: Lb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). Wait, but the structure is \"Lewis is hungry only if [that universal statement].\" So according to \"P only if Q,\" that would be Lb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). \n\nNow combining the antecedent and consequent with the main conditional. The entire statement is \"If [antecedent], then [consequent].\" So the whole formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Lb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc))\n\nBut wait, I need to check variable scope. The antecedent uses \u2203x, and the consequent has a \u2200x. To avoid confusion, maybe rename the variable in the universal quantifier. Let's say the consequent's universal quantifier uses y instead of x. So:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Lb \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc))\n\nThat way, variables x and y are distinct, avoiding any accidental capture. \n\nLet me double-check the translations:\n\n- \"a human chased Hazel\" is indeed an existential quantifier: there exists some x that is a human (Nx) and chased Hazel (Rxc). \n\n- \"Lewis is hungry only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\": The \"no monkeys\" part is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc). Then, since \"only if\" is implication from P to Q, it's Lb \u2192 (forall...). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication is correct. So the final formula should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Lb \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc))\n\nI think that's right. Let me check if there are any other possible misinterpretations. For example, does \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" mean that there are no monkeys that kicked her? Which is equivalent to \"for all monkeys, they didn't kick her,\" which is what I have. \n\nAlso, the main structure is a conditional where the antecedent is existential and the consequent is a material implication.

In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is saying that if Hazel kicked Hazel, then it must be that no monkeys kicked Hazel. \n\nLet's identify the components. Hazel is denoted by c. So \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" is Q(c, c). The other part is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel,\" which means there does not exist a monkey who kicked Hazel. So that's \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)). \n\nPutting that together, the consequent becomes Q(c, c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)). \n\nNow, combining the antecedent and consequent with the conditional arrow (\u2192), the entire formula should be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, b)) \u2192 (Q(c, c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)))\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the scope of the quantifiers is correct. Let me check again. The first part is a universal quantifier over all x, stating that if x is a monkey, then x saw Lewis. The consequent is the implication about Hazel. \n\nYes, that seems right. Also, in the consequent, the \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is correctly translated as the negation of an existential quantifier. \n\nAnother thing to check: are there any other possible interpretations? For example, does \"only if\" require any specific handling? Since \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B, I think that's correct here. \n\nSo the final formula should be the implication where the antecedent is the universal statement about monkeys seeing Lewis, and the consequent is the implication about Hazel's kicking. \n\nI think that's all. Let me write it out properly with the logical symbols.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192P(x,b))\u2192(Q(c,c)\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Ox\u2227Q(x,c)))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then every human saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The abbreviations provided are R, c, N, P, O, Q.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. So the overall form will be \u00acRcc \u2192 (something). \n\nA is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\", which translates to \u00acRcc since R is [1] chased [2], and c is Hazel. So the antecedent is straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"every human saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" Let's break this down. The phrase \"every human saw Hazel only if...\" suggests that for every human, if they saw Hazel, then some condition about monkeys not kicking Hazel holds. \n\nThe \"only if\" part in logic usually translates to an implication where the condition is the antecedent. So \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So here, for each human x, if x saw Hazel (Pxc), then it must be that no monkeys kicked Hazel. \n\nNow, \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" means that there does not exist a monkey that kicked Hazel. So that's \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). Because Oy is \"y is a monkey\" and Qyc is \"y kicked Hazel\". So the negation of existence of such a y.\n\nPutting it all together, the consequent is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc))).\n\nWait, but let me check the structure again. The original consequent is \"every human saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So for every human, their seeing Hazel implies that no monkeys kicked her. So yes, the structure is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc))).\n\nSo combining the antecedent and consequent, the entire formula is \u00acRcc \u2192 [\u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))].\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the abbreviations correctly. R is [1] chased [2], so Rcc is Hazel chased Hazel. The negation is correct. N is [1] is a human, P is [1] saw [2], so Pxc is x saw Hazel. O is [1] is a monkey, Q is [1] kicked [2], so Qyc is y kicked Hazel. The existential quantifier with Oy and Qyc, then negated. \n\nAlso, the order of quantifiers and implications. The universal quantifier for x (humans) and the implication inside. Also, the inner implication for Pxc leading to the negation of the existence of monkeys kicking Hazel. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there's any other way to structure it. For example, could the \"only if\" apply to the entire \"every human saw Hazel\"? But \"only if\" usually connects the two clauses directly. So \"every human saw Hazel only if...\" means that for each individual case of a human seeing Hazel, the condition must hold. So the structure is as I have it. \n\nAnother thing to check: the scope of the quantifiers. The existential quantifier for y is inside the implication for x. That's correct because for each x, if they saw Hazel, then there's no y (monkey) that kicked Hazel. \n\nSo the final formula should be: \u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))\n\nAlternatively, the negation of the existential can be written as a universal with a negation: \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) is equivalent to \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc). But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard symbols. Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the original way is better here. \n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc)))\n\nI need to make sure there are no parentheses issues. Let me write it again with proper parentheses. The consequent is \u2200x [Nx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc))]. So the entire implication is \u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc))).\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcc\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192(Pxc\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(Oy\u2227Qyc)))",

The abbreviations are M for \"is a donkey\" and P for \"saw [2]\". \n\nFirst, I remember that when translating English sentences with quantifiers like \"a\", we usually use existential quantifiers. Since the sentence has two instances of \"a donkey\", there are two donkeys involved. But I need to make sure they are distinct variables because the same donkey could potentially see itself, but the original sentence doesn't specify if they are the same or different. However, in formal logic, unless specified, we can't assume they are different, so we need to use two separate variables.\n\nSo the structure would be \"There exists an x such that x is a donkey, and there exists a y such that y is a donkey and x saw y.\" Wait, but existential quantifiers can be nested. So maybe it's \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u2203y (My \u2227 Pxy)). Alternatively, since the two \"a donkey\" are separate, maybe it's better to have two existential quantifiers. Let me check. \n\nYes, the correct way is to have two existential quantifiers, one for each donkey. So the formula would be \u2203x \u2203y (Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Pxy). But I need to make sure that the variables are properly scoped. Alternatively, it can be written as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u2203y (My \u2227 Pxy)). But in predicate logic, the order of the existential quantifiers can be moved because they don't affect each other. So \u2203x \u2203y (Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Pxy) is equivalent to \u2203x \u2203y (Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Pxy). \n\nWait, the standard way is to have both quantifiers at the front. So \u2203x \u2203y (Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Pxy). That makes sense. So the first donkey is x, the second is y. Both are donkeys, and x saw y. \n\nLet me check if there's any other aspect. The original sentence is in the past tense, but that's not relevant for predicate logic. Also, the use of \"a\" implies existence, so existential quantifiers are correct here. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization should be \u2203x \u2203y (Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Pxy).

The sentence to formalize is \"Every monkey chased a human.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"is a monkey,\" N for \"is a human,\" and R for \"chased.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The main structure is \"Every monkey chased a human.\" So, for every monkey, there's some human that they chased. \n\nIn predicate logic, \"Every monkey\" translates to a universal quantifier \u2200x. Then, we need to express that if x is a monkey (Ox), then there exists a human (Ny) such that x chased y (Rxy). \n\nSo the structure would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Rxy)). Wait, but I need to make sure that the existential quantifier is correctly placed. The original sentence says \"Every monkey chased a human,\" which implies that for each monkey, there is at least one human they chased. So yes, the universal quantifier for monkeys, and inside that, an existential quantifier for humans. The human has to be a human (Ny) and the chasing relation Rxy. \n\nLet me check if there's any ambiguity. The sentence could be misinterpreted if \"a human\" was a specific one, but since it's \"a human\" with the indefinite article, it's an existential quantifier. So each monkey has some human (possibly different for each monkey) that they chased. \n\nSo putting it all together: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u2203y (N y \u2227 R x y)). \n\nI need to use the abbreviations correctly. The connectives are implication for the universal statement, and conjunction inside the existential. The order of the quantifiers is important here. The universal comes first, then the existential. \n\nI should also make sure that the variables are properly bound. The x in Ox is bound by the universal quantifier, and the y is bound by the existential. \n\nNo other abbreviations are given, so I don't need to use anything else. The logical symbols are standard: \u2200, \u2203, \u2192, \u2227. \n\nSo the final formula should be \u2200x(Ox\u2192\u2203y(Ny\u2227Rxy)). Let me double-check against the example provided.

The sentence to formalize is: \"If a human chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if no donkeys ate.\" The abbreviations given are N for human, R for chased, c for Hazel, M for donkey, b for Lewis, and I for ate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The main structure is a conditional statement: If A, then B. Where A is \"a human chased Hazel\" and B is \"Lewis is a donkey only if no donkeys ate.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"a human chased Hazel.\" In predicate logic, this would be an existential quantifier because there's a human (at least one) who did the chasing. So, \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc). Wait, but sometimes \"a human\" could be read as an existential, right? Yes, since it's \"a human\" not \"every human.\"\n\nNow, the consequent B: \"Lewis is a donkey only if no donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"only if\" is a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So, here, if Lewis is a donkey (Mb), then it must be that no donkeys ate. The \"no donkeys ate\" part is the negation of the existence of a donkey that ate. So, \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx).\n\nPutting that together, the consequent would be Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Alternatively, Mb \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Either is acceptable, but maybe using the existential negation is more direct here.\n\nSo the entire statement is: If there exists a human who chased Hazel, then (Lewis is a donkey implies no donkeys ate). So the structure is:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, we need to make sure the quantifiers are properly scoped. Also, sometimes when you have multiple quantifiers, you have to check for variable capture. But in this case, the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent's negated existential are separate. But to avoid confusion, maybe use different variables? Let me see. The antecedent uses x, and the consequent's negated existential could use y. Let me check:\n\nOriginal antecedent: \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc). Consequent: Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy). So combining them, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))\n\nAlternatively, since the variable in the existential is bound, it doesn't matter if we reuse x, but using a different variable is clearer. However, in the example given, they used c for Hazel and x as a variable. So maybe it's okay to reuse x here. Let me check if that's a problem. If we have \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix), then the x here is bound by the existential, so it's okay. So the formula can be written as:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut maybe to make it clearer, we can use another variable. However, since the example uses x as the variable, perhaps it's acceptable. Also, in formal logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers, so even if the same variable is used in different parts, it's okay as long as they are bound by different quantifiers. So the formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut in this case, when writing the formula, the x in the antecedent is bound by the \u2203x, and the x in the consequent's \u00ac\u2203x is another bound variable. So they are separate. So the formula is okay.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, perhaps use a different variable for the donkeys. For example, in the consequent's negated part, use z:\n\n\u00ac\u2203z (Mz \u2227 Iz). Then the formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203z (Mz \u2227 Iz))\n\nBut since the problem says to use standard syntax and not include any extra text, maybe the variables can be the same. However, in the example provided, the formula uses x for the universal quantifier and c for the constant. So in the example, the formula is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So variables can be reused as long as they are properly bound.\n\nTherefore, the final formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut wait, when you have two existential quantifiers with the same variable, but they are in different scopes. Let me check. The first \u2203x is in the antecedent, and the second \u00ac\u2203x is in the consequent. Since they are in different scopes, they are separate. So the x in the antecedent is bound by the \u2203x, and the x in the consequent's \u00ac\u2203x is another bound variable. So it's okay. Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to use a different variable for the donkeys, but since the problem didn't specify any variable names, we can choose any. However, in standard practice, variables are typically x, y, z, etc. So maybe using y in the consequent would be better. Let me adjust that. Then:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (My \u2227 Iy))\n\nThis is also correct. But since the example uses x, maybe the problem expects variables to be x. However, the problem says to use standard syntax. So either way is acceptable. But perhaps the problem expects variables to be x, so I can proceed with the first version.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nAlternatively, since the implication is nested, we can write it as:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx))\n\nBut which one is better? The original statement is \"no donkeys ate\", which is equivalent to \"for all donkeys, they didn't eat\". So both forms are equivalent. However, the problem's abbreviations use I: [1] ate. So \"no donkeys ate\" is \"there does not exist a donkey that ate\", which is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). So that's probably the more direct translation.\n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut wait, in the consequent, the implication is Mb \u2192 ... So the entire formula is:\n\nIf there exists a human who chased Hazel, then (if Lewis is a donkey, then there does not exist a donkey that ate).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, checking for correct syntax. The main connective is \u2192 between the antecedent and the consequent. The antecedent is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc), the consequent is Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). So the entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nThis is a well-formed formula in predicate logic. All quantifiers are properly applied, variables are bound, and the connectives are used correctly.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether the \"only if\" is correctly translated. The phrase \"Lewis is a donkey only if no donkeys ate\" translates to Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Because \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So Lewis being a donkey (Mb) can only happen if no donkeys ate. So Mb implies that no donkeys ate. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The sentence is: \"If Alfred ate, then not all donkeys will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. The main conditional is \"If Alfred ate, then...\" followed by a \"only if\" clause. Let me recall that \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the structure is \"not all donkeys will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" So maybe that part is structured as (not all donkeys will run) \u2192 (every monkey saw Hazel). Wait, but the entire thing is the consequent of the main conditional starting with \"If Alfred ate.\"\n\nLet me outline the components. The main sentence is: If I(a) (since I is \"[1] ate\" and a is Alfred), then [something]. The [something] is \"not all donkeys will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" Let me handle that part.\n\nBreaking down \"not all donkeys will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"not all donkeys will run\" can be written as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). Then \"only if\" introduces the condition. So if \"not all donkeys will run\" only if \"every monkey saw Hazel,\" that would translate to (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)) \u2192 (\u2200y(Oy \u2192 Pyh)), where h is Hazel (c). Wait, the abbreviation for Hazel is c, right? The abbreviations list says c: Hazel. So P is \"[1] saw [2]\", so if the monkey (Oy) saw Hazel, it's Py c.\n\nPutting that together: The entire consequent is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Py c). \n\nSo the whole sentence is Ia \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Py c)]. \n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if that's correct. The structure is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's how it should be structured.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to make sure that the \"only if\" is correctly placed. Let me think again. The original is: \"not all donkeys will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" So \"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. So here B is \"not all donkeys will run\", and C is \"every monkey saw Hazel.\" So the consequent is B \u2192 C, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Py c). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is Ia \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc)).\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested, so that's acceptable. However, sometimes implications can be rephrased using logical equivalences. For example, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to return a well-formed formula in standard syntax, so either form is acceptable unless there's a specific preference. Since the original structure is an implication inside another implication, I think keeping it as is is correct.\n\nLet me check each part again. \n\n- \"Alfred ate\" is Ia.\n- \"Not all donkeys will run\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). Alternatively, this could be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx), but since the original is \"not all\", using the negation of the universal quantifier is more direct here.\n- \"Every monkey saw Hazel\" is \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Py c).\n\nPutting it all together: Ia \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Py c)).\n\nNow, I need to make sure that I'm using the abbreviations correctly. The abbreviations given are:\n\n- I: [1] ate\n- a: Alfred\n- M: [1] is a donkey\n- F: [1] will run\n- O: [1] is a monkey\n- P: [1] saw [2]\n- c: Hazel\n\nYes, all the predicates and constants are used correctly here. The only thing left is to write this in the proper logical syntax without any extra text. So the final formula should be:\n\nIa \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Py c))\n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers and variables are properly placed. Also, the use of parentheses is important here to avoid ambiguity. Let me check again:\n\nThe main implication is Ia \u2192 [something]. The [something] is another implication: (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc). So the parentheses should group the inner implication correctly. Also, using the arrow symbols correctly.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't see any mistakes here. Let me just verify once more with an example. Suppose Alfred did eat (Ia is true). Then, according to the statement, if it's not the case that all donkeys run (i.e., there's at least one donkey that doesn't run), then every monkey must have seen Hazel. So the logic holds. The formalization captures that conditional relationship.\n</think>\n\nIa\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc))",

I need to translate the sentence \"If a human chased Lewis, then Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, the wording here is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again. The sentence is structured as \"If [A], then [B only if C].\" So, the main implication is \"If A, then (B \u2192 C)\", right? Because \"B only if C\" translates to B \u2192 C.\n\nSo the first part is \"a human chased Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, N is \"[1] is a human\", R is \"[1] chased [2]\", and b is Lewis. So \"a human chased Lewis\" would be an existential quantifier? Wait, but in predicate logic, \"a human\" could be an existential quantifier. But maybe it's better to use an existential here. Wait, but sometimes in logic, \"a human\" can be ambiguous. However, given that the sentence starts with \"If a human chased Lewis\", it's probably an existential, meaning there exists a human who chased Lewis. So that would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb).\n\nThen the consequent is \"Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" Let's take \"Alfred will run\" as F a. The \"only if\" part means that F a is only true if every monkey saw Hazel. So \"F a only if C\" translates to F a \u2192 C. What's C? \"Every monkey saw Hazel.\" O is \"[1] is a monkey\", P is \"[1] saw [2]\", c is Hazel. So \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Py c). \n\nPutting it all together: The entire implication is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (F a \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc)). \n\nWait, but in the example given, they used universal quantifiers with implication. So for \"every monkey\", it's \u2200y (Oy \u2192 ...). That part seems right. Also, the structure of the main conditional is correct. \n\nLet me check again. The original sentence is \"If A, then (B only if C)\" which becomes \"A \u2192 (B \u2192 C)\". So yes, the structure is correct. \n\nNow, I need to make sure that the variables are properly quantified. The first part is an existential quantifier over x (for the human who chased Lewis). The consequent has F a, which is a statement about Alfred, and then a universal quantifier over y for the monkeys. \n\nSo the entire formula should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Pyc))\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there's any possible mistake. For example, could the antecedent be a universal? No, because \"a human\" is an existential. If it were \"Every human chased Lewis\", it would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxb). But here it's \"a human\", so there exists some human who chased Lewis. \n\nAlso, the \"only if\" part: \"Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel\" is indeed F a \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc). \n\nYes, that seems right.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are R for \"chased\", c is Hazel, O for monkey, L for hungry, and P for saw.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" and B is \"every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\" Since Hazel is represented by c, this would be \u00acR(c, c). Because R is [1] chased [2], so Hazel (c) chasing Hazel (c) is Rcc, and the negation is \u00acRcc.\n\nNow the consequent B: \"every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, for each monkey, if it's hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel. Wait, but the structure here is \"every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" Let me think. The \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" part. So maybe it's saying that the statement \"every monkey is hungry\" is true only if \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is true. So the whole thing is: If every monkey is hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel. But the original wording is \"every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel,\" which would translate to (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Px(c)? Wait, no. Wait, the \"only if\" is part of the implication for each monkey. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, \"every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel\" can be read as: For every monkey, if it is hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel. So for all x, if Ox \u2227 Lx, then \u2200y (Oy \u2192 P(y, c)). Wait, that might be overcomplicating. Let's break it down.\n\nThe phrase \"every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel\" can be rephrased as \"If every monkey is hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel.\" But that might not capture the intended meaning correctly. Alternatively, it could be that for each individual monkey, being hungry only if they saw Hazel. But the wording is \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" which suggests that the entire condition applies to the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" statement. So maybe the correct translation is: If all monkeys are hungry, then all monkeys saw Hazel. So that would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, c))). But I need to check if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's structured as: For every monkey, if it is hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel. Which would be \u2200x [(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 P(y, c))]. But this seems like a stronger statement. If even one monkey is hungry, then all monkeys must have seen Hazel. Which could be what the original sentence is saying.\n\nBut let's look at the original sentence again: \"every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" The \"only if\" here is a universal conditional. So \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent, and \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is the consequent. So the implication is: If every monkey is hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel. Therefore, the formalization would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, c))). \n\nBut wait, the \"every monkey saw Hazel\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, c)), since for every monkey x, x saw Hazel (c). So combining this, the consequent B is the implication between those two statements.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is: \u00acRcc \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, c))) ]\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes we can simplify or rephrase. Let me check if there's a more standard way. Alternatively, using logical equivalences, the implication A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax, so we can just write it as is.\n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) )\n\nBut need to make sure the variables are properly quantified. Also, note that in the abbreviations, P is [1] saw [2], so Pxc would be x saw c (Hazel). So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: the original sentence says \"every monkey is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\" The \"only if\" here is a universal quantifier over monkeys. So each instance of a monkey being hungry requires that all monkeys saw Hazel. So if even one monkey is hungry, then all must have seen her. Which is what the implication between the two universal statements captures. So I think that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization is:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, the order of the quantifiers and the implications need to be properly structured. Also, we can use different variables for the two universal quantifiers to avoid confusion, but since they're both bound by x, it's okay as long as the scope is clear. However, in formal logic, using the same variable in nested scopes is allowed as long as they are properly bound. So the formula is well-formed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 ( (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) )\n\nBut to make sure, maybe we need parentheses around the implications. Also, in standard syntax, the formula is written with the arrows and quantifiers properly placed. So yes, that's the correct structure.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 ( \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) )",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys will attack.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a biconditional (if and only if). On the left side, we have \"Hazel isn't a human.\" The right side is \"no donkeys will attack.\"\n\nStarting with the left part: \"Hazel isn't a human.\" The abbreviation for \"is a human\" is N, and Hazel is represented by c. So, since it's negated, that would be \u00acNc. Got that part.\n\nNow the right part: \"no donkeys will attack.\" The abbreviation for \"is a donkey\" is M, and \"will attack\" is G. So, \"no donkeys will attack\" translates to there does not exist a donkey that will attack. In predicate logic, that's usually expressed as \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). Wait, because we need to say that for all donkeys, they do not attack? Or that there's no x such that x is a donkey and x attacks. Let me think. \"No donkeys will attack\" means that there are no donkeys that attack. So, for all x, if x is a donkey, then x does not attack. Alternatively, \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). Both are equivalent because of the negation of the existential quantifier. So which one is better? The standard way is to use the universal quantifier with implication. Wait, but the negation of \u2203x(Px \u2227 Qx) is equivalent to \u2200x(Px \u2192 \u00acQx). So both expressions are equivalent. However, since the sentence is \"no donkeys will attack,\" it's more natural to use the universal quantifier. But in this case, since the biconditional is connecting \u00acNc with the right part, perhaps either form is acceptable. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" was translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they used the universal quantifier with implication. So maybe here, for \"no donkeys will attack,\" we can use \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Because that's the equivalent of saying for all x, if x is a donkey, then x does not attack. But wait, the original is \"no donkeys will attack,\" which is equivalent to \"every donkey will not attack,\" which would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Alternatively, \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). Both are correct. However, in the example, they used universal quantifier for \"every,\" so maybe here, since \"no donkeys\" is equivalent to \"all donkeys do not,\" we should use the universal. But the user might expect the negation of the existential. Let me think again. Let's see: \"No donkeys will attack\" can be phrased as \"It is not the case that there exists a donkey that will attack,\" which is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). Alternatively, \"All donkeys do not attack,\" which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Both are logically equivalent. However, depending on the conventions of the problem. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So for a universal statement, they use the universal quantifier with implication. So if we take \"no donkeys will attack\" as a universal statement (all donkeys do not attack), then it would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). But \"no donkeys will attack\" is more directly translated as \"there are no donkeys that attack,\" which is the negation of the existential. But which one is more appropriate here? Since the example uses universal for \"every,\" maybe here we should use the negation of the existential. Wait, but \"no donkeys will attack\" is a universal negative. In predicate logic, universal negatives are often expressed as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). But also, they can be written as \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). Since both are equivalent, but perhaps the problem expects the negation of the existential here. Let me check the abbreviations again. The abbreviations are M: [1] is a donkey, G: [1] will attack. So \"no donkeys will attack\" would be there does not exist an x such that x is a donkey and x will attack. Therefore, \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). That seems correct. \n\nSo putting it all together, the biconditional is between \u00acNc and \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). So the entire formula would be \u00acNc \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). Alternatively, since biconditional is symmetric, maybe we can also write it the other way, but the order here is \"Hazel isn't a human if and only if...\" so the left side is \u00acNc and the right is the donkey part. \n\nWait, but sometimes people prefer to have the existential negated in such cases. Let me confirm once again. The original sentence is \"Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys will attack.\" So \"if and only if\" connects two propositions: A \u2194 B, where A is \"Hazel isn't a human\" (\u00acNc) and B is \"no donkeys will attack\" (which is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx)). Therefore, the formula is \u00acNc \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). \n\nAlternatively, another way to write \"no donkeys will attack\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). So then the formula would be \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Which one is correct? Both are logically equivalent. But according to the example given, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated using the universal quantifier with implication. So if \"no donkeys will attack\" is equivalent to \"every donkey will not attack,\" then perhaps the problem expects the universal form. However, in the example, the translation uses the universal quantifier for \"every,\" but here we have \"no,\" which is a universal negative. So in predicate logic, universal negatives are usually translated as \u2200x(Px \u2192 \u00acQx). So maybe here, the correct translation is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Therefore, the biconditional would be \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nBut how to decide between the two? Let me think about the structure. The example uses \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" Similarly, \"No donkeys will attack\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Therefore, the right-hand side of the biconditional is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Therefore, the entire formula is \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nBut I need to check if that's correct. Let me recall that \"No S are P\" in predicate logic is translated as \u2200x(Sx \u2192 \u00acPx). So in this case, \"No donkeys will attack\" is \"No donkeys are attackers,\" so \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Therefore, that's correct. Therefore, the correct translation is \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nSo the final formula is \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nWait, but another way to think is that \"no donkeys will attack\" is equivalent to \"there are no donkeys that attack,\" which is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx). But since \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx) is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Gx), both are correct. However, given the example uses the universal quantifier for a universal statement, I think the problem expects the universal quantifier form here. \n\nSo the answer should be \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nLet me check again the abbreviations. N is \"[1] is a human,\" c is Hazel. So \u00acNc is correct. M is [1] is a donkey, G is [1] will attack. So for each donkey x, Gx is \"x will attack.\" Therefore, \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the final answer is that.\n</think>\n\n\u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If Lewis won't run, then every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If Lewis won't run, then [something].\" The \"something\" is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" So the overall structure is a conditional statement where the antecedent is about Lewis not running, and the consequent is a statement involving monkeys, Hazel, and humans being hungry.\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Lewis won't run.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] will run\" is F, and \"Lewis\" is b. So \"Lewis won't run\" would be \u00acFb.\n\nNow the consequent: \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" This part is a bit tricky. The phrase \"only if\" in logic usually translates to an implication where the condition is necessary. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. But here, it's saying that for every monkey, if they saw Hazel, then it must be that no humans are hungry. Also, \"no humans are hungry\" would be the negation of \"there exists a human that is hungry.\" Let me think.\n\nBreaking it down: \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" So for every monkey, if they saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry. So the structure would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Px c \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))). Wait, but \"saw Hazel\" is P with the monkey as the first argument and Hazel (c) as the second. So for each monkey x, if x saw c, then it's the case that there are no hungry humans. \n\nBut the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" part. Wait, maybe I need to structure it as: If every monkey saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry. But the original sentence says \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry,\" which is equivalent to saying that if no humans are hungry, then every monkey saw Hazel? Wait no, \"only if\" reverses that. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So if we have \"Every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry,\" that would mean that if every monkey saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry? Or perhaps for each monkey, if they saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original statement is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" The \"only if\" here is connecting the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" to the condition \"no humans are hungry.\" So it's like saying that the fact that every monkey saw Hazel can only happen if there are no hungry humans. Therefore, the structure would be: (Every monkey saw Hazel) \u2192 (no humans are hungry). \n\nBut how to formalize \"every monkey saw Hazel\"? That would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Px c). So the implication is: [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Px c)] \u2192 [\u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)]. \n\nBut the original sentence is structured as \"If Lewis won't run, then [this implication].\" So the entire thing is \u00acFb \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Px c)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)) ].\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the \"only if\" applies per monkey. For example, maybe it's saying that for each monkey, if they saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry. Which would be \u2200x [ (Ox \u2227 Px c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ]. But that would mean that whenever a monkey saw Hazel, there are no hungry humans. Which is slightly different. Let me think about the difference between these two interpretations.\n\nOriginal sentence: \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" The \"only if\" is a universal quantifier over the monkeys. So for each monkey, their having seen Hazel is only possible if no humans are hungry. Therefore, for every monkey x, if x saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry. So \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Px c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). But Ox is already \"x is a monkey,\" so maybe we need to include that? Wait, the \"every monkey\" part is already covered by the universal quantifier. So perhaps \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Px c \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))). Which is equivalent to \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Px c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). So for every x, if x is a monkey and x saw Hazel, then there are no hungry humans.\n\nBut the original sentence says \"every monkey saw Hazel only if...\" So maybe the \"saw Hazel\" is a universal condition. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look up how \"only if\" works in these contexts. \n\nThe phrase \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the statement is \"Every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry,\" then A is \"Every monkey saw Hazel\" and B is \"no humans are hungry.\" Therefore, the implication is A \u2192 B. So ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc ) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). \n\nBut then the entire consequent of the main conditional is this implication. So the main formula is \u00acFb \u2192 [ ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc ) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ) ].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original sentence is structured such that \"only if\" applies to each instance. For example, for each monkey, their having seen Hazel is only if no humans are hungry. Which would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Pxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). But that's different. \n\nLet me consider the difference. Suppose there are two monkeys. If the first interpretation is correct (the implication over the universal), then if both monkeys saw Hazel, then there are no hungry humans. But if only one monkey saw Hazel, the antecedent of the implication is false, so the implication holds regardless. However, in the second interpretation, each time a monkey saw Hazel, it requires that there are no hungry humans. So if two monkeys saw Hazel, both instances would require that there are no hungry humans. But both interpretations might be logically equivalent. Let's check:\n\nFirst interpretation: ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc ) ) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y... \n\nSecond interpretation: \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Pxc ) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y... )\n\nAre these equivalent? Let's see. The first is a material implication where if all monkeys saw Hazel, then the condition holds. The second says that for each monkey, if they saw Hazel, then the condition holds. These are not equivalent. For example, if there are two monkeys, and only one saw Hazel, then the first implication's antecedent is false (since not all monkeys saw Hazel), making the implication true regardless. The second interpretation would have the implication hold for each monkey (for the one that saw Hazel, the implication holds if the condition is met; for the one that didn't, the antecedent is false, so implication holds). But if the condition is not met (there are hungry humans), and only one monkey saw Hazel, then in the second interpretation, the implication would be false for that monkey, making the universal statement false. Whereas in the first interpretation, since not all monkeys saw Hazel, the implication holds. \n\nSo which interpretation is correct? The original sentence is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" here is modifying the entire \"every monkey saw Hazel\" part. So it's saying that the only way that every monkey saw Hazel is if there are no hungry humans. However, if some monkeys saw Hazel and others didn't, the \"only if\" doesn't apply. Therefore, the correct formalization would be the first interpretation: if every monkey saw Hazel, then there are no hungry humans. \n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" So maybe it's equivalent to saying that for every monkey, if they saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry. Because if even one monkey saw Hazel, that would require the condition. Let me think of an example. Suppose there is a monkey who saw Hazel, but there are hungry humans. Then according to the second interpretation, the statement would be false. According to the first interpretation, since not all monkeys saw Hazel, the implication holds. But does the original sentence allow for that? The original sentence says that whenever every monkey saw Hazel, then there are no hungry humans. But it doesn't say anything about cases where not every monkey saw Hazel. However, if the sentence is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry,\" it could be interpreted as \"for every monkey, their having seen Hazel is only possible if no humans are hungry,\" which would require that whenever any monkey saw Hazel, the condition holds. Therefore, perhaps the correct formalization is the second interpretation. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me look for similar examples. For instance, \"John drinks only if everyone is asleep\" would be formalized as \u2200x (Drinks(x) \u2192 EveryoneAsleep). Wait, no. If it's \"John drinks only if everyone is asleep,\" that's Drinks(John) \u2192 EveryoneAsleep. But if it's \"Every person drinks only if everyone is asleep,\" that would be \u2200x (Drinks(x) \u2192 EveryoneAsleep). So in this case, the original sentence is \"every monkey saw Hazel only if...\" which would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Pxc) \u2192 ... ). \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct formalization is that for every monkey x, if x saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry. So \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Pxc) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) ). But since Ox is \"x is a monkey,\" and we are quantifying over every x, maybe we can write it as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)) ). Which is equivalent. \n\nSo putting it all together, the main formula is \u00acFb \u2192 [ \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)) ) ].\n\nNow, let's check the quantifiers and logical symbols. The main conditional is \u00acFb \u2192 ... \n\nInside the consequent, we have a universal quantifier over x, and for each x, if x is a monkey, then if x saw c (Hazel), then it's not the case that there exists a human who is hungry. \n\nSo translating that:\n\n\u00acFb \u2192 ( \u2200x ( Ox \u2192 ( Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y ( Ny \u2227 Ly ) ) ) )\n\nAlternatively, the negation of \u2203 can be written as \u2200y \u00ac(Ny \u2227 Ly), so \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly) is equivalent to \u2200y \u00ac(Ny \u2227 Ly), which is \u2200y (\u00acNy \u2228 \u00acLy). But the problem allows us to use the standard symbols, so either form is acceptable. However, since the abbreviation for \"no humans are hungry\" would be \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly), which is more concise.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)))\n\nNow, let's check if this is well-formed. The structure is correct. The quantifiers are properly scoped. The connectives are used appropriately.\n\nAnother thing to check: the original sentence says \"every monkey saw Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" The \"only if\" here is a universal condition per monkey. Therefore, the formalization as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 ... )) seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n\u00acFb \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Pxc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly)))\n\nWhich uses all the abbreviations provided:\n\n- F: [1] will run \u2192 \u00acFb for Lewis (b) not running.\n- O: [1] is a monkey \u2192 Ox.\n- P: [1] saw [2] \u2192 Pxc (x saw c, Hazel).\n- N: [1] is a human \u2192 Ny.\n- L: [1] is hungry \u2192 Ly.\n\nYes, this uses all the correct abbreviations. The quantifiers are \u2200 and \u2203 as needed. The connectives are \u2192, \u00ac, and \u2227. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00acFb\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Pxc\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(Ny\u2227Ly)))",

The sentence is: \"A human kicked Lewis or every human saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"is a human,\" Q for \"kicked,\" b for Lewis, P for \"saw,\" and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its two main parts connected by \"or.\" The first part is \"A human kicked Lewis,\" and the second part is \"every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"A human kicked Lewis.\" In predicate logic, when we say \"a human,\" that usually translates to an existential quantifier. So there exists some x such that x is a human and x kicked Lewis. Using the abbreviations, N(x) for x being human, and Q(x, b) since b is Lewis. So this part would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Qxb).\n\nNow the second part: \"every human saw Hazel.\" \"Every human\" translates to a universal quantifier. For all x, if x is a human, then x saw Hazel. Using the abbreviations, N(x) again, and P(x, c) because c is Hazel. So that would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc).\n\nPutting the two parts together with the logical OR (\u2228), the entire formula becomes (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Qxb)) \u2228 (\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxc)).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the scope of the quantifiers. The existential quantifier applies only to the first part, and the universal to the second. Since they're connected by OR, the structure should be correct as written. Also, checking the use of connectives: the first part uses \u2227 because we need both N and Q for the same x, while the second uses \u2192 because it's a universal statement. \n\nLet me double-check. The original sentence is an \"or\" between two statements. Each part is a separate clause. So the translation should correctly capture that either there's someone who is a human and kicked Lewis, or for all humans, they saw Hazel. Yes, that seems right. I don't see any other abbreviations or symbols needed here. The variables are properly quantified, and the connectives are appropriately used. So the final formula should be as I wrote above.\n</think>\n\n(\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Qxb)) \u2228 (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The sentence is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the structure. The main conditional seems to be \"If a human chased Lewis, then [something].\" The \"something\" here is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is usually translated as P \u2192 Q. So, \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry\" would be \"\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (N(x))\" or something like that? Wait, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, \"only if\" in English is a bit different. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So, if the statement is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry,\" then A is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" and B is \"no humans are hungry.\" So that would be \u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 B. But what is B?\n\n\"No humans are hungry\" is the negation of \"some humans are hungry.\" Since L is \"[1] is hungry,\" then \"no humans are hungry\" would be \u00ac\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 L(x)), or equivalently \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)).\n\nSo putting that together, the \"only if\" part is \u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)).\n\nBut the entire sentence starts with \"If a human chased Lewis, then [this implication].\" So the entire formula would be: \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) \u2192 [\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x))].\n\nWait, but the first part is \"a human chased Lewis,\" which is \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)), right? Because there exists some human x who chased Lewis (b).\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire implication is:\n\n\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can rephrase the entire thing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal sentence: If a human chased Lewis, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nThe main structure is: If P, then (Q \u2192 R), where:\n\nP: a human chased Lewis (i.e., \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)))\n\nQ: Alfred didn't kick Hazel (\u00acQ(a, c))\n\nR: no humans are hungry (\u00ac\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 L(x)) or \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)))\n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 L(x)))\n\nAlternatively, using the universal quantifier version for R.\n\nBut which form is better? The abbreviations given are L: [1] is hungry, so \"no humans are hungry\" would be \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)).\n\nSo the inner implication is \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)).\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications are right-associative, so A \u2192 B \u2192 C is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So that's okay.\n\nBut maybe we can also write it as \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (\u00acN(x) \u2228 \u00acL(x)))\n\nWhich is equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence of A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) being equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. Let me check if that applies here. The entire structure is P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R), which is equivalent to (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 R.\n\nSo maybe that's a more standard way to write it. Let me see.\n\nOriginal: If P, then (Q \u2192 R) is equivalent to (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 R.\n\nSo in this case, that would be (\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) \u2227 \u00acQ(a, c)) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)).\n\nBut both forms are logically equivalent. The question is, which one is more appropriate here? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are correct, but perhaps the first form is more direct from the English sentence.\n\nBut let's see. The original sentence says: If a human chased Lewis, then [Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry]. Since \"only if\" is translated as an implication, the structure is P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R). So the first form is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects the nested implication. Let me check the example given. In the example, the sentence \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So they use the standard implication for the conditional.\n\nTherefore, for this problem, following the same pattern, the correct formalization would be:\n\n\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)))\n\nBut we need to make sure about the variables. Wait, in the universal quantifier part, the variable x is reused. But in the first part, x is bound by \u2203x, and in the inner implication, the \u2200x would bind the same variable? Wait, no, in predicate logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers. So in the formula:\n\n\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x)))\n\nThe first \u2203x and the \u2200x are separate, so the x in \u2200x is a new binding. That's okay because variable names can be reused as long as they are bound by their own quantifiers. However, to avoid confusion, sometimes people rename variables, but the problem doesn't specify that. So it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, to make it clearer, we could write \u2200y (N(y) \u2192 \u00acL(y)), but the problem says to use the abbreviations given, and variables are just placeholders. So the formula is okay as written.\n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations. Let me confirm:\n\nN: [1] is a human \u2192 N(x) means x is a human.\n\nR: [1] chased [2] \u2192 R(x, b) since the first is the chaser, second is the chased (Lewis is b).\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2] \u2192 \u00acQ(a, c) because Alfred (a) didn't kick Hazel (c).\n\nL: [1] is hungry \u2192 in the universal part, N(x) \u2192 \u00acL(x) (if x is a human, then x is not hungry).\n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is correct.\n\nBut let me check again the original sentence: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe \"only if\" part is crucial. Let me think of it as \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no humans are hungry\" meaning that the only way Alfred didn't kick Hazel is if there are no hungry humans. So if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then there are no hungry humans. Which is exactly \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 \u2200x (N(x)\u2192\u00acL(x)).\n\nSo the entire implication is: If there was a human chasing Lewis, then (if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no humans are hungry).\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nWhich uses the abbreviations correctly and follows the logical structure.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx))",

I need to translate the sentence \"No monkeys saw Lewis if and only if a monkey ate.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence has two parts connected by \"if and only if\". So the overall structure is a biconditional (\u2194). The left side is \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" and the right side is \"a monkey ate\".\n\nStarting with the left part: \"No monkeys saw Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" can be expressed as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx). Here, A is \"monkey\" (Ox) and B is \"saw Lewis\" (Pxb, since P is [1] saw [2], and b is Lewis). So the left part would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb).\n\nNow the right part: \"a monkey ate.\" The abbreviation I is \"[1] ate\", so this is an existential statement. There exists some x such that Ox (is a monkey) and Ix (ate). So \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Ix).\n\nPutting them together with the biconditional: \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acPxb) \u2194 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Ix). Let me check if that's correct. The original sentence says that the absence of monkeys seeing Lewis is equivalent to there being a monkey that ate. That seems to capture the meaning. \n\nWait, are there any other possible interpretations? For example, does \"a monkey ate\" refer to exactly one monkey or at least one? The abbreviation uses \"a monkey\", which in English usually means \"there exists at least one\", so \u2203x is correct. \n\nAlso, the left side is \"No monkeys saw Lewis\", which is a universal statement. So combining them with \u2194 should be right. I think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00acPxb)\u2194\u2203x(Ox\u2227Ix)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the sentence: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey saw Lewis only if Lewis won't run.\" The goal is to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nStarting with the abbreviations:\n- M: [1] is a donkey\n- P: [1] saw [2]\n- c: Hazel\n- O: [1] is a monkey\n- b: Lewis\n- F: [1] will run\n\nThe sentence is a conditional, so the main structure is \"If A, then B.\" Let's break down each part.\n\nFirst, the antecedent: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" In logic, \"not all\" translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. So \"All donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)). Therefore, the negation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x, c)) by moving the negation inside, but the original form might be more straightforward here.\n\nNext, the consequent: \"every monkey saw Lewis only if Lewis won't run.\" The phrase \"only if\" is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, for every monkey, if they saw Lewis, then Lewis won't run. So for each monkey, Oy \u2192 (P(y, b) \u2192 \u00acF(b)). Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"every monkey saw Lewis only if Lewis won't run.\" So the \"only if\" applies to the entire conditional. So it's \"For every monkey, if the monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis won't run.\" So \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (P(y, b) \u2192 \u00acFb)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 P(x, c)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (P(y, b) \u2192 \u00acFb)).\n\nAlternatively, using the existential form for the antecedent: \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x, c)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (P(y, b) \u2192 \u00acFb)). But the problem says to use the abbreviations as given, and the user might prefer the negation of the universal rather than the existential. However, both are logically equivalent. But since the original sentence says \"not all,\" maybe keeping it as \u00ac\u2200 is better.\n\nSo the final formula would be: \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x,c)) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (P(y,b) \u2192 \u00acFb)).\n\nI need to check the variables. The antecedent uses x, the consequent uses y; since they are bound variables, they can be different. Also, ensure that all predicates are correctly applied. The \"saw\" predicate P is used with the first argument as the subject and the second as the object. So P(x,c) means x saw Hazel (c), and P(y,b) means y saw Lewis (b). The F predicate is about Lewis (b) not running, so \u00acFb.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write that out properly with the correct symbols.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c))\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192(P(y,b)\u2192\u00acFb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"No donkeys are happy or every donkey chased Alfred.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. It has two main parts connected by \"or\": \"No donkeys are happy\" and \"every donkey chased Alfred.\" So the structure is (Part1) \u2228 (Part2).\n\nStarting with \"No donkeys are happy.\" The abbreviation for donkey is M (since M: [1] is a donkey). To say \"No donkeys are happy,\" which is equivalent to \"For all x, if x is a donkey, then x is not happy.\" Using K for happy, this would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acKx). Alternatively, another way to express \"No donkeys are happy\" is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Kx), which means \"There does not exist an x such that x is a donkey and x is happy.\" Either form is correct, but I need to see which fits better with the rest.\n\nNow the second part: \"every donkey chased Alfred.\" Using R for chased, and a for Alfred. So this would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa). That's straightforward.\n\nPutting them together with \"or\": (\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acKx)) \u2228 (\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa)). Alternatively, if I used the other form for the first part, it would be (\u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Kx)) \u2228 (\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa)). But since the original sentence is structured as \"No donkeys are happy or every donkey...\", the first part is likely best translated as a universal statement.\n\nWait, but the original sentence is an \"or\" between the two. So the entire statement is a disjunction of two universal statements. So the correct formalization would be:\n\n\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acKx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa)\n\nBut let me check if there's any possible misunderstanding. The original sentence is \"No donkeys are happy or every donkey chased Alfred.\" The \"or\" here is at the top level, so the two disjuncts are separate. There's no ambiguity in the structure here. So yes, the translation would be the disjunction of the two universal statements.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in predicate logic, when you have two universal quantifiers with the same variable, you can technically have them as separate, but since the variable is bound in each, it's okay. So the formula is correct as written. So the final answer should be:\n\n\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acKx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa)\n\nLet me check the abbreviations again. M is for donkey, K is happy, R is chased, a is Alfred. Yes, that's correct. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acKx)\u2228\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa)",

The abbreviations provided are O for \"[1] is a monkey\" and b for \"Lewis\". \n\nFirst, the sentence is a simple statement about Lewis being a monkey. In predicate logic, when we say something is a certain way, we usually use a predicate. Here, O is the predicate that means \"is a monkey\". Since Lewis is represented by the constant b, I should apply the predicate O to the constant b.\n\nSo the structure would be O followed by b. Since there's no quantifier involved here because we're talking about a specific individual (Lewis), it's just a simple atomic formula. There's no need for any quantifiers like \u2200 or \u2203. \n\nLet me double-check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" became \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). That makes sense because it's a universal statement. But here, the statement is about a specific person, Lewis. So it's not a universal or existential quantifier situation. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be Ob. I don't see any other elements needed here. The sentence is straightforward, just stating that the individual b (Lewis) has the property O (being a monkey). \n\nI should make sure that I'm using the correct symbols. The predicate O applied to the constant b is written as Ob. There are no connectives needed here like \u2227 or \u2192 because it's a single assertion. \n\nYes, that seems right.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this logic problem. So the sentence is: \"If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" And I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" and B is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\" The abbreviation for \"saw\" is P, which is [1] saw [2]. So \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" would be \u00acPab, since a is Alfred and b is Lewis. Because P is a two-place predicate, right? So Pab means Alfred saw Lewis, and the negation is \u00acPab.\n\nNow the consequent B: \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" Let's break this down. The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is translated as A \u2192 B. So here, for each monkey, if the monkey kicked Lewis, then it must be that no monkeys kicked Hazel. Wait, but the structure here is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So maybe it's saying that for all monkeys, if a monkey kicked Lewis, then there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel. Hmm.\n\nLet me think. Let's rephrase the statement. The entire statement is a universal quantification over monkeys. For every monkey x, if x kicked Lewis, then it is not the case that any monkey (including x) kicked Hazel. So the consequent part is: For all x, if O(x) (x is a monkey) then (Q(x,b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (O(y) \u2227 Q(y,c))). Wait, because \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u00ac\u2203y (O(y) \u2227 Q(y,c)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to structure it as: For all x, if O(x) then (Q(x,b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (O(y) \u2227 Q(y,c))). But that seems a bit complex. Let me check.\n\nSo the original statement is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" applies to each individual monkey's action. So for each monkey, if they kicked Lewis, then there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel. So the entire consequent is a universal statement: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc))).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire conditional is \u00acPab \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))].\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to simplify the inner part. The consequent of the inner implication is \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc), which is equivalent to \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc). So perhaps another way to write the entire formula is \u00acPab \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc))). But both forms are logically equivalent. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviation Q is [1] kicked [2], so Qxb is x kicked b (Lewis), and Qyc is y kicked c (Hazel). The abbreviation O is [1] is a monkey, so Ox and Oy.\n\nSo which form is better? The problem might prefer using the existential quantifier negated. Let me check the example given. In the example, they used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is straightforward. So perhaps the first approach is acceptable.\n\nSo the full formula would be:\n\n\u00acPab \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))\n\nAlternatively, using the universal quantifier:\n\n\u00acPab \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc)))\n\nEither is correct, but maybe the first one is more direct given the original statement. Let me verify the original statement again. The original says \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). So the first version is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acPab \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all the abbreviations are used correctly. The abbreviations are:\n\nP: [1] saw [2]\n\na: Alfred\n\nb: Lewis\n\nO: [1] is a monkey\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\n\nc: Hazel\n\nYes, so Pab is Alfred saw Lewis, and \u00acPab is the antecedent. Then Ox is x is a monkey. Qxb is x kicked Lewis (b), and Qyc is y kicked Hazel (c). So the formula is correct.\n\nNow, check if the logical structure is correct. The main connective is the implication \u00acPab \u2192 ... The consequent is a universal quantifier over x, which has Ox \u2192 ... inside. The inner part is Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acPab \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))\n\nI need to write this using standard symbols. Let me check for proper parentheses. The order of operations might require parentheses around the quantified parts. Let me make sure that the implication arrows are properly scoped. Since in predicate logic, the quantifiers have high precedence, but to avoid ambiguity, parentheses are added.\n\nYes, the formula is well-formed. So this should be the correct translation.\n</think>\n\n\u00acPab\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Qxb\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(Oy\u2227Qyc)))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred and Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\" The abbreviations given are R for \"chased\", a for Alfred, Q for \"kicked\", and b for Lewis. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\" Using the abbreviation R, which is [1] chased [2], so the first part would be \u00acR(a, a) because Alfred is both the subject and object here.\n\nThen the second part is \"Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\" The abbreviation Q is [1] kicked [2], so Lewis (b) didn't kick Alfred (a). That would be \u00acQ(b, a).\n\nThe sentence combines these two with \"and\", so in logical terms, it's the conjunction of the two negations. So putting it all together, it's \u00acR(a,a) \u2227 \u00acQ(b,a). \n\nI need to make sure there are no quantifiers here since the sentence is about specific individuals (Alfred and Lewis), so no need for \u2200 or \u2203. Just the two atomic propositions negated and joined by a conjunction. \n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations: R is for chasing, Q for kicking. The names a and b are correctly assigned. The negations are applied correctly to each action. The structure seems right. So the final formula should be the conjunction of the two negated predicates.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRaa \u2227 \u00acQba",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"Not all monkeys ate if and only if Hazel is happy.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"is a monkey,\" I for \"ate,\" K for \"is happy,\" and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The main structure is a biconditional (\"if and only if\"), so the entire statement is saying that two things are equivalent: \"Not all monkeys ate\" and \"Hazel is happy.\"\n\nStarting with the left side of the biconditional: \"Not all monkeys ate.\" In predicate logic, \"all monkeys ate\" would typically be expressed as \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). But since it's \"not all,\" we need the negation of that. So \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). Alternatively, I recall that the negation of \"all\" can be expressed as \"there exists at least one that doesn't,\" which would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx). Are these two equivalent? Yes, because \u00ac\u2200 becomes \u2203 with the negation inside. So \u00ac\u2200x(Px) is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00acPx). In this case, P is (Ox \u2192 Ix), so \u00ac(Ox \u2192 Ix) would be Ox \u2227 \u00acIx. Therefore, both forms are equivalent. But which one should I use here? The original sentence is \"Not all monkeys ate,\" which is more naturally expressed as the negation of the universal quantifier, so \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix). However, depending on the formalization style, sometimes people prefer to convert it to the existential form. But since the problem allows either as long as it's well-formed, either should be acceptable. However, since the example given in the problem uses the universal form (like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), maybe it's better to stick with the negation of the universal here for consistency.\n\nNow, the right side is straightforward: Hazel is happy. Since c is Hazel, that's Kc.\n\nSo putting it together, the entire biconditional is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 Kc.\n\nWait, but let me check if I got the direction right. The sentence says \"Not all monkeys ate if and only if Hazel is happy.\" So \"if and only if\" means both sides are equivalent. So when Hazel is happy, it's not the case that all monkeys ate, and vice versa. So the formalization should correctly capture that equivalence.\n\nAnother way to think about \"Not all monkeys ate\" is that there exists a monkey who didn't eat. So maybe using the existential form would be better here. Let me write both versions and see which is more appropriate.\n\nOriginal version: \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Ix) \u2194 Kc.\n\nAlternative version: \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx) \u2194 Kc.\n\nAre these equivalent? Yes. But the problem says to use the abbreviations given. Since the abbreviations don't specify any particular form, either should be okay. However, the example uses a universal quantifier with implication (Lx\u2192Rxc). The example's structure was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which is \u2200x(Lx\u2192...). In our case, the original statement is a negation of \"all monkeys ate,\" which is similar to the example's negation. However, in the example, the negation was outside the universal, so maybe that's the way to go here. But maybe the problem expects the conversion to the existential. Let me think again.\n\nIn predicate logic, \"Not all P are Q\" is typically formalized as \u2203x(Px \u2227 \u00acQx). So perhaps that's the more standard approach. Let me check that. For example, \"Not all dogs are mammals\" would be \u2203x(Dx \u2227 \u00acMx), which is the negation of \u2200x(Dx\u2192Mx). So both are equivalent. So maybe the problem expects the existential form here. But how to decide? Let's look at the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the example uses the universal form for \"every,\" then for \"not all,\" the negation of that universal would be appropriate. However, if the user wants the existential form, that's also correct. Since the problem allows any well-formed formula, both are correct. But perhaps the answer expects the negation of the universal. Let me go with that for now. So \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc.\n\nBut wait, let me check the sentence again. The sentence is \"Not all monkeys ate if and only if Hazel is happy.\" So the biconditional connects \"Not all monkeys ate\" with \"Hazel is happy.\" So the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc. Alternatively, \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx) \u2194 Kc. Both are correct. However, since the example uses the universal form, perhaps the first approach is better here. But maybe the problem expects the existential. Hmm. Let me think if there's any other consideration. The problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations are O: is a monkey, I: ate. So \"ate\" is a one-place predicate? Wait, the I is \"[1] ate,\" which is a one-place predicate. So Ix would mean \"x ate.\" So yes, the structure is correct. So whether we use the negation of the universal or the existential, both are correct. However, perhaps the problem expects the negation of the universal. Let me check the example again. The example's sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which became \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So R is a two-place predicate, \"[1] admires [2].\" So in that case, they used the universal with implication. For the negation, maybe we can use the same structure. Therefore, \"Not all monkeys ate\" would be the negation of \"All monkeys ate,\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix). Therefore, the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc. However, another approach is to convert the negation of universal to existential. Let me check if the problem expects that. For example, sometimes in logic, it's preferred to have no negations in front of quantifiers, but that's not a rule. The problem says to return a well-formed formula. Both are well-formed. But perhaps the answer expects the existential form. Let me think again. The problem says \"Not all monkeys ate...\" which is equivalent to \"Some monkeys did not eat,\" which is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx). So maybe that's the better way. Let me go with that. So the biconditional would be (\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx)) \u2194 Kc. \n\nSo now, the entire formula is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx) \u2194 Kc. \n\nBut which one is correct? Both are logically equivalent. However, the problem may prefer one form. Since the example uses the universal quantifier with implication, maybe the answer here should use the negation of the universal. But perhaps the problem expects the existential. Let me check the example again. The example's formalization was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). If the user had a sentence like \"Not every linguist admires Charlie,\" then the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). So in this case, the problem's example uses the universal, so for consistency, perhaps the answer here should use \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc. However, since the problem allows any well-formed formula, both are acceptable. But to match the example's style, perhaps the first approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the most direct translation. The sentence is \"Not all monkeys ate...\" which is the negation of \"All monkeys ate,\" so \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix). Therefore, the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc. \n\nBut I'm a bit torn here. Let me check the exact wording. The original sentence is \"Not all monkeys ate if and only if Hazel is happy.\" So the left side is \"Not all monkeys ate,\" which is the negation of the universal statement. Therefore, translating directly, it's \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix). Therefore, the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the existential form, then it's \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx) \u2194 Kc. Both are correct, but which one to choose? Since the example uses the universal form, perhaps the answer here should use the negation of the universal. However, in standard logic, sometimes people prefer to push the negation inside. But the problem says to return a well-formed formula, and both are correct. \n\nGiven that the example uses the universal form, I think the answer here is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc. \n\nWait, but let me check the biconditional direction. The sentence is \"Not all monkeys ate if and only if Hazel is happy.\" So when Hazel is happy, it's not the case that all monkeys ate, and when it's not the case that all monkeys ate, Hazel is happy. So the biconditional is between the two. So the formalization is correct either way. \n\nSo the final answer would be either \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc or \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx) \u2194 Kc. \n\nBut which one is expected? Let me think again. The example's sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which became \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So for \"Not all monkeys ate,\" the direct negation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx). Since the problem allows any well-formed formula, both are acceptable. However, the example uses the universal form, so maybe the answer here should follow that. Therefore, the answer is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc. \n\nBut I need to be sure. Let me think of another example. Suppose the sentence was \"Some monkeys did not eat if and only if Hazel is happy.\" Then it would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx) \u2194 Kc. But the original sentence is \"Not all monkeys ate...\" which is equivalent to \"Some monkeys did not eat.\" So both are the same. Therefore, both formalizations are correct. \n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations don't specify whether to use the existential or the negated universal. Therefore, either is acceptable. However, given the example's use of the universal quantifier, perhaps the answer here should use the negated universal. \n\nTherefore, I will go with \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there's any other possible misinterpretation. The sentence is \"Not all monkeys ate if and only if Hazel is happy.\" The \"if and only if\" is the main connective. So the entire statement is a biconditional between \"Not all monkeys ate\" and \"Hazel is happy.\" Therefore, the correct formalization is as I stated. \n\nSo the final answer is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix) \u2194 Kc. Alternatively, \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acIx) \u2194 Kc. Both are correct. But since the example uses the universal form, I'll go with the first one.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Ix)\u2194Kc",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"Every donkey is happy unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations provided are M for [1] is a donkey, K for [1] is happy, O for [1] is a monkey, P for [1] saw [2], and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The main structure is \"Every donkey is happy unless [condition].\" The \"unless\" here suggests a conditional where the condition is the negation of the following part. So, \"A unless B\" can be translated as \"If not B, then A\" or \"A if not B\". Alternatively, it can also be represented as \"A \u2228 B\", but I need to be careful with the exact logical structure here.\n\nThe condition here is \"not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" Let's break that down. \"All monkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc). Therefore, \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc). Which is equivalent to \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acPxc), by the negation of a universal quantifier.\n\nNow, putting it back into the original sentence. The statement is that every donkey is happy unless this condition holds. So, if the condition (not all monkeys saw Hazel) is true, then the donkey isn't necessarily happy. Wait, actually, \"unless\" usually works as \"A unless B\" meaning that if B is not true, then A must be true. So, \"Every donkey is happy unless not all monkeys saw Hazel\" would translate to: If it is not the case that not all monkeys saw Hazel (i.e., all monkeys saw Hazel), then every donkey is happy. Alternatively, using the \"A \u2228 B\" structure: Either every donkey is happy, or not all monkeys saw Hazel. Wait, but the original sentence says \"Every donkey is happy unless [not all monkeys saw Hazel].\" So the condition (not all monkeys saw Hazel) is the exception. So if the exception doesn't hold (i.e., if all monkeys did see Hazel), then the main clause (every donkey is happy) must hold. So the logical form would be: If all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey is happy. But the original sentence is structured as \"Every donkey is happy unless [exception].\" So another way to think is: For every donkey, it is happy unless [exception]. Wait, maybe I should consider the scope here. Is the \"unless\" applying to each donkey individually or to the entire \"every donkey is happy\"?\n\nLet me re-express the sentence: \"Every donkey is happy unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" So the entire statement about donkeys being happy has an exception. So, if the exception (not all monkeys saw Hazel) is true, then it's not necessarily the case that every donkey is happy. But if the exception is false (i.e., all monkeys saw Hazel), then every donkey is happy. So the logical form would be: If all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey is happy. Which would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky). But the original sentence is phrased as \"Every donkey is happy unless [exception]\". So another approach is to think of it as \u2200y(My \u2192 (Ky \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc))). Wait, that might not capture it correctly. Let me think again.\n\nThe structure \"A unless B\" can be translated as A \u2228 B, where A is \"Every donkey is happy\" and B is \"not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" So the entire formula would be: \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc). However, this might not be the correct way because in logic, \"unless\" can sometimes be tricky. Alternatively, using material implication: \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"if not B, then A\". So, if not B, then A. Here, B is \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\", so not B is \"all monkeys saw Hazel\". Therefore, the implication would be: If all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey is happy. Which is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky). \n\nBut which one is the correct formalization? Let's consider the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the structure is straightforward. Now, for \"unless\", let's think about the example. Suppose we have \"Every linguist admires Charlie unless [something]\". If the structure is similar, maybe we need to have for each donkey, the donkey is happy unless the condition. Wait, but the original sentence says \"Every donkey is happy unless...\" which is a universal statement with an exception. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to rephrase the original sentence as \"For every donkey, if all monkeys saw Hazel, then the donkey is happy.\" But that would be \u2200y(My \u2192 (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 Ky)). But that seems different from the original. Let me check. The original is \"Every donkey is happy unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" So for each donkey, if it is not the case that not all monkeys saw Hazel (i.e., all monkeys saw Hazel), then the donkey is happy. Wait, but that would mean that if all monkeys saw Hazel, then the donkey is happy. But the original sentence is saying that every donkey is happy unless the condition holds. So if the condition holds (not all monkeys saw Hazel), then maybe the donkey isn't happy? But the \"unless\" is a bit ambiguous here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formalization is that for every donkey, it is happy if all monkeys saw Hazel. Which would be \u2200y(My \u2192 (\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 Ky)). Which can be rewritten as \u2200y(My \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2228 Ky)), which is equivalent to \u2200y(My \u2192 (Ky \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc))). Which would correspond to \"Every donkey is happy or not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" But since it's for each donkey, it's possible that for some donkeys, one part holds and for others, the other. However, the original sentence says \"Every donkey is happy unless...\" which implies that if the condition holds, then there exists at least one donkey that is not happy. Wait, no. The original sentence is a universal statement about donkeys, but with an exception. If the exception holds (not all monkeys saw Hazel), then the universal statement (every donkey is happy) might not hold. So the entire statement is equivalent to: If the exception does not hold (i.e., all monkeys saw Hazel), then every donkey is happy. Which is the implication: \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky). \n\nSo which is the correct formalization? Let's think of the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). If we had \"Every linguist admires Charlie unless [something]\", then the structure would depend on how the unless is applied. If it's a global condition, then the implication would be that if the condition is not met, then the universal holds. \n\nIn our problem, the sentence is \"Every donkey is happy unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" So if \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is the exception, then when the exception is false (i.e., all monkeys saw Hazel), the main clause must be true. Therefore, the correct formalization is: If all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey is happy. \n\nSo translating \"all monkeys saw Hazel\" is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc). Then the implication is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky). \n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Let's check the abbreviations again. The abbreviations are:\n\nM: [1] is a donkey (so Mx is \"x is a donkey\")\n\nK: [1] is happy (Kx is \"x is happy\")\n\nO: [1] is a monkey (Ox is \"x is a monkey\")\n\nP: [1] saw [2] (Px c is \"x saw Hazel\")\n\nc: Hazel.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky)\n\nBut the problem requires the entire sentence to be formalized. However, the original sentence is \"Every donkey is happy unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" So the formalization is the implication that if not all monkeys saw Hazel, then not every donkey is happy? Wait, no. The \"unless\" is a bit tricky. Let me recall that \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" and also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". \n\nSo in this case, A is \"Every donkey is happy\" (i.e., \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky)), and B is \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\" (i.e., \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc)). Therefore, \"A unless B\" would be equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\", which is \"If all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey is happy.\" So the correct formalization is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky).\n\nAlternatively, using the \"A \u2228 B\" structure, it would be \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc). But in predicate logic, these two forms are equivalent. However, which one is more appropriate here? The example given in the problem uses an implication with a universal quantifier. Since the example uses an implication, perhaps the intended answer here is the implication form. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky)\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Suppose someone interprets the sentence as \"For every donkey, it is happy unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" In that case, the structure would be for each donkey y, Ky \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc). Which would be \u2200y(My \u2192 (Ky \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc))). However, this would mean that for each donkey, either it is happy or the condition holds. But the original sentence is about the entire set of donkeys. If the condition holds (not all monkeys saw Hazel), then there might be some donkeys not happy, but not necessarily all. However, the original sentence says \"Every donkey is happy unless...\" which suggests that if the condition holds, then it's not the case that every donkey is happy. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the entire universal statement about donkeys being happy is conditional on the monkeys seeing Hazel. So the implication approach is better. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is the implication between the two universal statements. \n\nNow, let's write this out using the abbreviations. The antecedent is \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc), the consequent is \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky). Therefore, the formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(My \u2192 Ky)\n\nBut we can use variables consistently. Since variables are bound, we can use the same variable letter if they are in different scopes. However, to avoid confusion, perhaps using different variables. But in predicate logic, it's standard to reuse variables as long as they are bound. So the formula is correct as written. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxc)\u2192\u2200y(My\u2192Ky)\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxc)\u2192\u2200y(My\u2192Ky)",

The abbreviations are N for \"[1] is a human\" and R for \"[1] chased [2]\". \n\nSo the sentence is saying that for every human, there's some human they chased. So first, I should start with a universal quantifier for the first human. So \u2200x. Then, if x is a human (Nx), then there exists some y such that y is a human (Ny) and x chased y (Rxy). \n\nWait, but the structure here is \"Every human chased a human.\" So each human chased at least one human. So it's like, for all x, if Nx then there exists a y where Ny and Rxy. \n\nSo the formula would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Rxy)). \n\nLet me check if that's correct. The universal quantifier covers all x, and for each x that is a human, there's at least one y (which could be any human, including x itself?) that is chased by x. The existential quantifier is inside the implication because it's dependent on x. \n\nI think that's right.

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. The main structure is a conditional: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis won't run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, let's identify the two parts of the main conditional. The antecedent is \"Every monkey saw Lewis,\" and the consequent is \"Lewis won't run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Every monkey saw Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations provided, O(x) means x is a monkey, and P(x, y) means x saw y. Since Lewis is denoted by 'b', this part translates to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, b)). That's straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Lewis won't run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, \"Lewis won't run\" is the A part, and \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is the B part. \n\n\"Lewis won't run\" is \u00acF(b), since F(x) is \"x will run\". The \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" part translates to \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)), because Q(x, y) is x kicked y, and c is Hazel. So there doesn't exist a monkey x who kicked Hazel.\n\nPutting the consequent together: \u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)). \n\nNow, combining the antecedent and consequent with the main conditional (if...then...), which is \u2192 in logic. So the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)))\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any scope issues or if I need to adjust the quantifiers. Let me verify. The antecedent is a universal quantifier over monkeys seeing Lewis. The consequent is a material implication where the antecedent is \u00acF(b) and the consequent is the negation of the existence of monkeys kicking Hazel. \n\nAnother way to write \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)) is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00acQ(x, c)), by moving the negation inside and converting the existential to universal. But the problem allows using the abbreviations as needed, so both forms are correct. However, since the original uses \"no monkeys kicked Hazel,\" which is a negation of existence, it's probably better to stick with \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)) unless there's a reason to convert it. \n\nTherefore, the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 P(x, b)) \u2192 (\u00acF(b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)))\n\nI need to make sure that all the abbreviations are used correctly. Let's cross-check:\n\n- O is [1] is a monkey: correct.\n- P is [1] saw [2]: here, x saw b (Lewis), correct.\n- F is [1] will run: \u00acF(b) means Lewis won't run, correct.\n- Q is [1] kicked [2]: x kicked c (Hazel), correct.\n- c is Hazel: yes.\n\nSo the formalization should be correct. Also, the structure of the main conditional is maintained. I don't see any mistakes here. Let me write it in the required symbols without any extra text.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192P(x,b))\u2192(\u00acF(b)\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Ox\u2227Q(x,c)))",

So, the sentence is: \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" And I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"every monkey chased Hazel\" and B is \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" \n\nStarting with A: \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and R is \"[1] chased [2]\". Hazel is represented by c. So, \"every monkey chased Hazel\" would be translated as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc). That makes sense because for all x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x chased c (Hazel).\n\nNow, the consequent B: \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" Let's parse this. The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is translated as P \u2192 Q. So here, for each monkey, if the monkey is asleep, then Hazel kicked Hazel. \n\nBut \"every monkey is asleep only if...\" So the structure is: For all x, if Ox (x is a monkey) and Jx (x is asleep), then...? Wait, no. Wait, the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" part. Wait, maybe I should think of it as: For every monkey, if it is asleep, then Qcc (Hazel kicked Hazel). Because the \"only if\" connects the monkey being asleep with the condition that Hazel kicked Hazel. \n\nSo, the consequent B would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc)). Wait, but maybe it's \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Qcc). But since Qcc is a proposition (Hazel kicked Hazel), which doesn't involve x, the quantifier would apply. However, since the condition is that for every monkey, if they are asleep, then Qcc must hold. So, for all x, if Ox (monkey) then (Jx \u2192 Qcc). Alternatively, since \"every monkey is asleep only if Qcc\". Which could be rephrased as: If every monkey is asleep, then Qcc. But the original sentence says \"every monkey is asleep only if Qcc\". Wait, the original says \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" The structure here is a universal statement where each instance of a monkey being asleep requires the condition. \n\nWait, maybe there's a difference between \"every monkey is asleep only if Qcc\" and \"if every monkey is asleep, then Qcc\". Let me think. In English, \"only if\" can sometimes be a biconditional, but usually it's a one-way implication. For example, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the entire \"every monkey is asleep\" is A, then A \u2192 B. But how is \"every monkey is asleep\" phrased? That would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx). So then the consequent would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 Qcc. But the original sentence is \"every monkey is asleep only if Qcc\". So that would translate to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx) \u2192 Qcc. But is that correct?\n\nWait, but the original sentence is \"every monkey is asleep only if Qcc\". Let me think again. Suppose we have \"Every P is Q only if R.\" How to translate this? It's a bit ambiguous. One interpretation is that for every individual that is P, if it is Q, then R must hold. But R here is Qcc, which is a specific proposition. So, for every monkey, if it is asleep, then Qcc. Therefore, \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Qcc ). Alternatively, since Ox implies that if Jx then Qcc: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc)). These are equivalent because (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc)) is equivalent to (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Qcc. Since Qcc is a proposition that doesn't involve x, but the quantifier is over x. However, since the implication is for each monkey, if they are asleep, then Qcc must be true. \n\nBut then, combining the entire thing: the original sentence is \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then [every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel].\" So the entire implication is: [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc)] \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc))]. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Let me check again. Let me parse the consequent again. The consequent is \"every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" So \"only if\" here is connecting \"monkey is asleep\" with \"Hazel kicked Hazel.\" For each monkey, being asleep implies that Hazel kicked Hazel. So for all monkeys x, Jx \u2192 Qcc. But since x is a monkey, we can also include Ox. So \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc)). Which is equivalent to \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Qcc). \n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc))\n\nAlternatively, since the consequent's implication can be written as a material conditional. \n\nLet me check if there's any other way. Another way to think about \"only if\" is that the entire universal statement is the antecedent. Like, if all monkeys are asleep, then Qcc. But that would be different. For example, if the sentence was \"Every monkey is asleep only if Hazel kicked Hazel,\" that could be interpreted as: If it's the case that every monkey is asleep, then Hazel kicked Hazel. Which would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 Qcc. But that's different from \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc)). \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? Let's take an example. Suppose there are two monkeys, A and B. If we have \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc)), then if A is asleep, Qcc must be true. Similarly for B. So if either A or B is asleep, Qcc must be true. Whereas if it's (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 Qcc, then only if both A and B are asleep does Qcc have to be true. \n\nThe original sentence says \"every monkey is asleep only if Qcc\". The \"only if\" here is per-monkey or for the whole? In English, \"Every X is Y only if Z\" is ambiguous. But typically, \"only if\" applies to each individual case. For example, \"Every student passed only if they studied\" would mean that for each student, if they passed, then they studied. Not that if all students passed, then they all studied. So in this case, the correct translation would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Jx) \u2192 Qcc ). \n\nTherefore, the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc)), which is equivalent. \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n[\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc)] \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc))]\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations again. \n\nO: [1] is a monkey (so Ox means x is a monkey)\nR: [1] chased [2], so Rxc is x chased c (Hazel)\nJ: [1] is asleep (Jx is x is asleep)\nQ: [1] kicked [2], so Qcc is c (Hazel) kicked c (Hazel)\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Jx \u2192 Qcc))\n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly scoped and that the connectives are correct. Also, check that there's no free variables. All variables are bound by the universal quantifiers. \n\nYes, this looks correct. The antecedent is the universal statement about all monkeys chasing Hazel, and the consequent is the universal statement that for each monkey, if it's asleep, then Hazel kicked herself. \n\nSo the formalization should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Jx\u2192Qcc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the sentence is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" And we need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The main structure seems to be \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless [condition].\" The \"unless\" here is a bit tricky. I remember that in logic, \"A unless B\" can often be translated as \"A \u2228 B\", but sometimes it might be \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Let me think. So \"unless\" usually means \"if not\", so \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"if not B, then A\". So maybe \u00acB \u2192 A. Alternatively, it can also be A \u2228 B. Let me check which one applies here.\n\nThe original sentence is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" So the condition is \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\". So the structure is: For every donkey, if [condition is not met], then they kicked Lewis? Or if the condition is not met, then the donkey kicked Lewis? Wait, no. Wait, \"unless\" here is separating two parts. Let me rephrase the sentence. It's saying that every donkey kicked Lewis, except if not all monkeys saw Hazel. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as: If it's not the case that all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey kicked Lewis. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Let me recall that \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" but also to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Let's test with an example. If I say \"I will go to the party unless it rains.\" That would mean if it doesn't rain, I will go. Or maybe it means I will go unless it rains, so if it rains, I won't go. Wait, this is confusing. The correct translation is \"I will go to the party unless it rains\" is equivalent to \"If it doesn't rain, then I will go\" which is \u00acrain \u2192 go. Alternatively, it's equivalent to \"I will go or it rains\", which is go \u2228 rain. So both are equivalent. So for our problem, the original sentence is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" Let me parse this as: For every donkey, [donkey kicked Lewis] unless [not all monkeys saw Hazel]. So applying the same logic, this would be equivalent to \"For every donkey, (donkey kicked Lewis) \u2228 (not all monkeys saw Hazel)\"? Or maybe \"If it is not the case that not all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey kicked Lewis.\" Which would be \u00ac(\u00acall monkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (every donkey kicked Lewis). Which simplifies to (all monkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (every donkey kicked Lewis). But the original sentence is structured as \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless [not all monkeys saw Hazel]\". So the \"unless\" is followed by a negative condition. Let me think again. Let me rephrase the sentence as \"Every donkey kicked Lewis if all monkeys saw Hazel.\" Because \"unless not all\" is equivalent to \"if all\". Because \"A unless \u00acB\" is equivalent to \"B \u2192 A\". Let me check: if we have \"A unless \u00acB\", that would be equivalent to \"\u00ac(\u00acB) \u2192 A\" which is B \u2192 A. So yes. So in this case, the sentence is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless \u00ac(all monkeys saw Hazel)\", which translates to \"If all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey kicked Lewis.\" So the implication is (all monkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (every donkey is such that it kicked Lewis). \n\nSo now I need to formalize both parts. \n\nFirst, \"all monkeys saw Hazel\". The abbreviation for \"[1] is a monkey\" is O, and \"[1] saw [2]\" is P. So \"all monkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Px c), since c is Hazel. \n\nThen, \"every donkey kicked Lewis\". The abbreviation for \"[1] is a donkey\" is M, and \"[1] kicked [2]\" is Q. Lewis is denoted by b. So this part is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b).\n\nPutting it together, the implication is: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Px c) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b). Wait, but the original structure was \"A unless B\" which we translated as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Wait, let me check again. The original sentence is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" So B is \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\", and A is \"every donkey kicked Lewis\". So the translation would be \u00acB \u2192 A. Here, B is \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\", so \u00acB is \"all monkeys saw Hazel\", so indeed, the implication is (all monkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (every donkey kicked Lewis). So that's correct. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The original sentence is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless [not all monkeys saw Hazel]\". So if \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is true, then the \"unless\" condition is met, which would mean that the main clause (\"every donkey kicked Lewis\") might not hold. Wait, but according to the translation \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\", so in this case, \"every donkey kicked Lewis\" \u2228 \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\". Which would be equivalent to \"Either every donkey kicked Lewis or not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" Alternatively, the implication is \"If not B, then A\", which is \"If all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey kicked Lewis.\" So both are equivalent. \n\nBut which form is better for formal logic? The implication form might be easier here. So the formula would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nBut wait, the entire statement is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" So another way to think is that the entire statement is a universal quantifier over donkeys, where for each donkey, the kicking happened unless the condition. But that might complicate things. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, could the structure be that for every donkey, (the donkey kicked Lewis) unless (not all monkeys saw Hazel). Which would translate to for every donkey x, (Qx b) \u2228 (\u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Py c)). Which would then be \u2200x [Mx \u2192 (Qx b \u2228 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Py c))]. \n\nBut that's a different approach. Which one is correct? \n\nThe original sentence is a general statement about all donkeys. The \"unless\" applies to each donkey's action. Or does it apply to the entire set of donkeys? Let me think. The sentence is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" The \"unless\" is a single condition for the entire statement. So if the condition (not all monkeys saw Hazel) is true, then it's not necessarily the case that every donkey kicked Lewis. But if the condition is false (i.e., all monkeys saw Hazel), then every donkey did kick Lewis. So the entire implication is that if all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey kicked Lewis. So the correct formalization would be the implication between the two universal statements. \n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose all monkeys saw Hazel. Then according to the sentence, every donkey must have kicked Lewis. If some monkeys didn't see Hazel, then maybe some donkeys didn't kick Lewis. But the original sentence says \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless...\" So regardless of whether the condition holds, every donkey kicked Lewis unless the condition holds. Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the \"unless\" applies to each donkey. For example, if the condition holds (not all monkeys saw Hazel), then it's possible that some donkeys didn't kick Lewis. But if the condition doesn't hold (all monkeys saw Hazel), then every donkey must have kicked Lewis. \n\nSo the correct translation would be that for all donkeys, if the condition (all monkeys saw Hazel) holds, then the donkey kicked Lewis. Which would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 [\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 Qxb]). \n\nAlternatively, since the entire statement is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis unless...\", the entire statement is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Qxb \u2228 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc))). \n\nWhich is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Qxb \u2228 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 \u00acPyc))). \n\nBut which form is required here? The problem is that the original sentence is a universal statement about donkeys modified by a condition. \n\nLet me compare the two approaches. \n\nApproach 1: The entire implication between two universal statements. \n\n(\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb)). \n\nApproach 2: For each donkey, the individual implication. \n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 [ (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc)) \u2192 Qxb ]). \n\nAre these two equivalent? \n\nLet me see. Approach 1 is (A \u2192 B), where A is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) and B is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nApproach 2 is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (A \u2192 Qxb)). \n\nAre these equivalent? Let's see. \n\nIn classical logic, (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to \u2200x ( (A \u2192 Bx) ), where B is \u2200x Bx. Wait, perhaps not directly. Let me think. Suppose B is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). Then Approach 1 is A \u2192 B. Approach 2 is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (A \u2192 Qxb)). \n\nIs A \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (A \u2192 Qxb))? \n\nYes. Because if A implies that for all x, if Mx then Qxb, then for each x, if Mx then (A implies Qxb). Because if A is true, then Qxb must be true for each x. \n\nSo both approaches are equivalent. Therefore, both formalizations are correct. \n\nBut which one is preferable? The problem says to use the abbreviations given and return a single well-formed formula. Let me check the example given. In the example, the sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" which was formalized as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the universal quantifier is over x, and the implication is inside. \n\nIn this case, if we follow approach 2, the formalization would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (A \u2192 Qxb)), where A is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc). So substituting, that would be \u2200x [Mx \u2192 ( \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 Qxb )]. \n\nAlternatively, approach 1 would be \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nWhich one is correct? Let me think about the meaning. The original sentence says that every donkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel. So if all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey did kick Lewis. If not all monkeys saw Hazel, then maybe some or all donkeys kicked Lewis. The sentence doesn't say that if not all monkeys saw Hazel, then no donkey kicked Lewis or something else. It just says that the kicking happened unless that condition. So the presence of the condition allows for the possibility that the kicking didn't happen. \n\nBut the formalization in approach 1 says that if all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey kicked Lewis. Which is correct. However, approach 2 says for every donkey, if all monkeys saw Hazel, then that donkey kicked Lewis. Which is equivalent. \n\nSo both are correct. However, in the example given, the formalization was using the universal quantifier with the implication inside. So perhaps the expected answer here is approach 2, where the universal quantifier over donkeys is used. \n\nBut let me check. Let's consider approach 1: (A \u2192 B), where A is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) and B is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nThis would be a material implication between two universal statements. But how is this structured in predicate logic? \n\nThe problem is that the original sentence is a universal statement modified by a condition. The example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier with an implication. So perhaps the expected answer is approach 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects approach 1. \n\nBut let's think about the structure of the sentence again. The main clause is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\", and the \"unless\" adds a condition. So the entire statement is that \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" holds if the condition (all monkeys saw Hazel) is met. If the condition is not met, then it's possible that \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" is false. \n\nSo the implication is that if the condition is met, then the main clause is true. So approach 1 is (A \u2192 B), where A is the condition (all monkeys saw Hazel) leading to B (every donkey kicked Lewis). \n\nBut how to write this in predicate logic? \n\nThe formula would be: \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nBut in predicate logic, when you have implications between quantified statements, you need to make sure that the variables are properly scoped. \n\nAlternatively, the formula could be written as: \n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 ( \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 Qxb )) \n\nWhich is equivalent to approach 2. \n\nWhich one is better? Let me check with the example. The example's sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" The formalization was \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). \n\nIf the example had been \"Every linguist admires Charlie unless [something]\", then perhaps the formalization would involve an implication inside the universal quantifier. \n\nGiven that, I think approach 2 is more in line with the example's structure. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ( \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 Qxb )). \n\nBut let me verify this. \n\nLet me break it down. For every x, if x is a donkey, then if all monkeys saw Hazel, then x kicked Lewis. \n\nWhich is equivalent to saying that if all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey kicked Lewis. \n\nWhich matches the original sentence's meaning. \n\nSo this seems correct. \n\nNow, let's write this using the abbreviations. \n\nThe abbreviations are: \n\nM: [1] is a donkey \n\nQ: [1] kicked [2] \n\nb: Lewis \n\nO: [1] is a monkey \n\nP: [1] saw [2] \n\nc: Hazel \n\nSo the formula is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ( \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Py c) \u2192 Qx b )). \n\nBut in predicate logic, the order of quantifiers matters. However, in this case, the inner \u2200y is part of the implication. \n\nYes, this should be correct. \n\nAlternatively, if we use approach 1, the formula would be ( \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Py c) ) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qx b) ). \n\nBut which one is correct? \n\nLet me think about possible scenarios. \n\nCase 1: All monkeys saw Hazel. Then, according to the original sentence, every donkey must have kicked Lewis. Both approaches would require this. \n\nCase 2: Not all monkeys saw Hazel. The original sentence says that in this case, the \"unless\" condition is met, so it's possible that not every donkey kicked Lewis. \n\nIn approach 1, since the antecedent (all monkeys saw Hazel) is false, the implication is true regardless of B. So the entire implication holds. \n\nIn approach 2, for each donkey x, if Mx is true, then (A \u2192 Qxb) becomes (false \u2192 Qxb), which is always true. Therefore, the entire formula holds regardless of whether the donkey kicked Lewis or not. \n\nSo in both cases, the formula is true. \n\nTherefore, both approaches are logically equivalent. \n\nBut the question is about how to represent it. The example given uses a universal quantifier with an implication, so perhaps the expected answer is approach 2. \n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are well-formed. However, perhaps the problem expects the approach where the implication is between two universal statements. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the approach where the universal quantifier is over donkeys. \n\nIn the example, the formalization was \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc), which is a universal quantifier over x, with the implication. \n\nSo following that pattern, perhaps the correct answer here is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 ( \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 Qxb )). \n\nBut to make sure, let me check if there's a standard way to handle \"unless\" in such contexts. \n\nAnother way to think about \"unless\" is that \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\". So in this case, the entire statement is \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" \u2228 \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\". \n\nBut \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\n\"Not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc). \n\nSo combining them with \u2228, we get \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc). \n\nBut this is equivalent to the implication \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb), because in propositional logic, A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. \n\nTherefore, this is approach 1. \n\nSo the formula \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) is equivalent to the disjunction. \n\nBut how to write this in predicate logic. \n\nSo perhaps the answer is either approach 1 or approach 2. \n\nBut which one is preferred? \n\nLooking back at the example, the example's sentence was a simple universal statement without an \"unless\". But if we had an \"unless\" in the example, say \"Every linguist admires Charlie unless [something]\", then the formalization would depend on whether the \"unless\" applies to each individual or the whole. \n\nBut since both approaches are logically equivalent, perhaps either is acceptable. However, the problem may expect one form. \n\nLooking at the example, the formalization is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). If we had \"Every linguist admires Charlie unless [not all ...]\", then following the same pattern, we might have \u2200x (Lx \u2192 (A \u2192 Rxc)), where A is the condition. \n\nBut in the example, there is no \"unless\", so it's straightforward. \n\nGiven that, I think the correct formalization here is the implication between two universal statements: ( \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) ) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb) ). \n\nBut I need to check if this is a well-formed formula. Yes, because it's an implication between two formulas. \n\nAlternatively, the other approach with the universal quantifier over x is also well-formed. \n\nBut which one is more standard? \n\nIn formal logic, when you have a conditional that applies to the entire statement, it's common to write it as an implication between the two quantified statements. For example, if the sentence was \"If all monkeys saw Hazel, then every donkey kicked Lewis,\" the formalization would be \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nSince the original sentence is equivalent to that, then this would be the correct formalization. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer should be: \n\n\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb)\n\nBut let me check for variable names. The abbreviations are M: [1] is a donkey, O: [1] is a monkey, etc. \n\nYes, so the variables y and x are just bound variables. \n\nBut in the problem's example, the variable is x. So perhaps using x and y is acceptable. \n\nBut in the formula, the order of quantifiers is important. However, in this case, the implication is between two separate universal statements. \n\nYes, this is acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is the implication between the two universal statements. \n\nSo the final answer is: \n\n\u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly placed. \n\nYes, because each universal quantifier is binding its own variable. \n\nAlternatively, using different variables for clarity, but since y is only in the antecedent and x in the consequent, there's no conflict. \n\nYes, this is correct. \n\nSo the final formula is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nBut let me write it without spaces as per the example. The example uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the answer should follow the same format. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\n\nYes, this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2200y(Oy\u2192Pyc)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. The sentence is: \"If every monkey is hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n\nFirst, let's identify the main components. The structure seems to be a conditional statement. The antecedent is \"every monkey is hungry,\" and the consequent is \"Alfred saw Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"every monkey is hungry.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and L is \"[1] is hungry.\" So translating \"every monkey is hungry\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Alfred saw Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the \"A\" is \"Alfred saw Alfred,\" and the \"B\" is \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n\nBreaking down \"Alfred saw Alfred\": The abbreviation P is \"[1] saw [2].\" Since both are Alfred, it would be Pa a.\n\nThen, \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviation Q is \"[1] kicked [2],\" and Lewis is denoted by b. So for every monkey (Ox), they kicked Lewis (Qx b). So that would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b).\n\nPutting the consequent together: Pa a \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b).\n\nNow, combining the antecedent and consequent with the main conditional: The entire statement is \"If [antecedent], then [consequent].\" So that would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 (Pa a \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qx b))\n\nWait, but I need to check if there's a scope issue with the variables. The consequent has a \u2200x, but the antecedent also uses \u2200x. However, in predicate logic, variables are bound within their quantifiers, so the x in the antecedent and the x in the consequent are separate. So this should be okay. But to make sure, the formula is structured correctly as a material implication where the antecedent is a universal statement and the consequent is another implication.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n(\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (Pa a \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Qy b))\n\nWait, here I changed the variable in the inner universal quantifier from x to y to avoid confusion, but in predicate logic, it's allowed to reuse variables as long as they are bound. However, since the original problem didn't specify needing to rename variables, perhaps it's acceptable to leave them as x. But in formal logic, having two quantifiers with the same variable in the same formula can sometimes be confusing, but technically, each quantifier binds its own variable. So in this case, the first \u2200x is in the antecedent, and the second \u2200x in the consequent is a separate scope. Therefore, it's acceptable. However, to make it clearer, maybe using a different variable like y for the second quantifier is better. But the problem says to use standard syntax and not add any extra text. Since the problem allows using the given abbreviations and standard symbols, perhaps it's okay to have both x's. Let me check the example given. In the example, they have \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), and that's acceptable even if there are other x's elsewhere. So I think it's okay.\n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 (Pa a \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb))\n\nBut wait, the abbreviations for Q are [1] kicked [2], so Qx b is correct. Also, the 'b' is Lewis. So yes.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n(\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 (Pa a \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb))\n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence is \"If every monkey is hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So the structure is: If A, then (B only if C). Which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, the structure is correct. Therefore, the formalization should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx)\u2192(Paa\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred won't attack only if no humans are hungry.\" The abbreviations provided are N (human), J (asleep), G (attack), a (Alfred), and L (hungry). \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If not all humans are asleep, then [something].\" The \"something\" is \"Alfred won't attack only if no humans are hungry.\" Let's break that down.\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So \"not all\" would be the negation of that, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), but maybe the first form is better here since it's a direct negation.\n\nNow the consequent is \"Alfred won't attack only if no humans are hungry.\" The phrase \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, it's \"Alfred won't attack only if no humans are hungry.\" So \"Alfred won't attack\" is \u00acG a. The \"only if\" part would link \u00acG a to the condition \"no humans are hungry.\" So the structure would be \u00acG a \u2192 (no humans are hungry). Wait, but \"only if\" typically puts the necessary condition after. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if Alfred won't attack (A) only if (B is true), then the formula is \u00acG a \u2192 B, where B is \"no humans are hungry.\"\n\nNow, \"no humans are hungry\" is the same as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Because for every human x, x is not hungry.\n\nPutting it all together: The entire statement is \"If [\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)], then [\u00acG a \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx)]\". So the whole formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00acG a \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx))\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any equivalences or if the structure can be simplified. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the direction of the implication. The original is \"If not all humans are asleep, then (Alfred won't attack only if no humans are hungry).\" So the consequent is the \"only if\" statement. The \"only if\" translates to an implication where the antecedent is the first part and the consequent is the condition. So \"Alfred won't attack only if no humans are hungry\" is \u00acG a \u2192 \u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might confuse \"if\" and \"only if,\" but in this case, \"only if\" is correct as the necessary condition. So the structure seems right.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any quantifier scopes that need to be carefully handled? The antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(...), which is correct. The consequent has an implication where the consequent is \u2200x(...). So the entire formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acG a \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx))\n\nI think that's the correct formalization. Let me just verify with an example. Suppose not all humans are asleep. Then, according to the statement, if Alfred doesn't attack, then no humans are hungry. That seems to align with the original sentence. So yes, that should be the right translation.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acG a\u2192\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx))",

The sentence is \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"is a monkey\" and P for \"[1] saw [2]\". I need to translate this into formal predicate logic.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\" Breaking it down: There are two parts here. The first part is \"No monkeys saw...\" which implies that for all monkeys, they didn't perform the action of seeing something. The something is \"a monkey that saw it.\" The \"it\" here probably refers to the first monkey, but I need to be careful with that.\n\nWait, \"it\" is ambiguous, but in the context, it might refer to the monkey that was seen. Let me think. The phrase \"a monkey that saw it\" suggests that there's a monkey which saw some entity. But since the entire sentence is about monkeys not seeing such a monkey, maybe \"it\" refers to the first monkey. Hmm, but that might create a loop. Let me try to rephrase the sentence.\n\nThe sentence can be read as: There does not exist a monkey that saw another monkey which saw that first monkey. Wait, but the original is \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\" So, \"it\" could refer to the first monkey. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider the structure. Let's rephrase the sentence as \"For all monkeys x, x did not see a monkey y such that y saw x.\" Because \"it\" would refer back to the original monkey that x is not seeing. So the structure is: For every monkey x, there does not exist a monkey y such that x saw y and y saw x. Wait, no. Wait, the original sentence is \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\" So the \"monkey that saw it\" is the y that saw something. The \"it\" is probably the same as the monkey that the first monkey saw. Wait, maybe I need to parse it as \"No monkeys saw (a monkey that saw it).\" The \"it\" here might be referring to some entity, but since the entire context is about monkeys, maybe \"it\" refers to a specific monkey. But the sentence is general, so maybe \"it\" is the same as the monkey that was seen. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is saying that there is no monkey who saw another monkey that saw that first monkey. So, for all x and y, if x is a monkey and y is a monkey, then it's not the case that x saw y and y saw x. Wait, but that would be a mutual seeing. But the original sentence is \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\" So perhaps the structure is: There is no monkey x such that x saw a monkey y (where y saw x). Because \"it\" refers to x, the original monkey. So the formalization would be \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). Wait, but the original sentence is \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\" So the first part is \"No monkeys saw...\", which translates to \"For all monkeys x, x did not see any monkey y such that y saw it (x).\" So the formula would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). Wait, but maybe the \"it\" is not x, but another entity. However, given that all the context is about monkeys, perhaps \"it\" refers to the first monkey. Let me check again.\n\nThe original sentence is: \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\" Let's break it down. The subject is \"No monkeys,\" which in logic would be \"For all x, if x is a monkey, then...\" The verb is \"saw,\" and the object is \"a monkey that saw it.\" So the object is an existential: there exists a monkey y such that y saw it. But what is \"it\"? If the entire sentence is about monkeys not seeing such a y, then \"it\" must refer to something. Since the sentence is about monkeys, perhaps \"it\" refers to the monkey that was being seen. Wait, but that would create a loop. Let's think of an example. Suppose there is a monkey A. If A saw a monkey B that saw A, then A saw B and B saw A. So the sentence is saying that there are no such monkeys. Therefore, the formalization would be that there does not exist a monkey x such that x saw some monkey y and y saw x. But the original sentence says \"No monkeys saw...\", which is a universal statement. So maybe it's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). Alternatively, maybe it's \u00ac\u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). Wait, but the original is \"No monkeys saw...\", which is a universal quantifier. Let's compare with the example given. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So \"No monkeys saw...\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac...). So the structure is universal for all monkeys x, they don't have the property of seeing a certain y.\n\nSo the \"saw a monkey that saw it\" part is that x saw a y (monkey) such that y saw it. Now, the \"it\" here is ambiguous. If \"it\" refers to x, then the condition is y saw x. Therefore, the entire part is \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx). Therefore, the formalization would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). Alternatively, maybe the \"it\" refers to some other entity, but since the sentence is about monkeys, perhaps it's x. Let me check the example again. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" translates to \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the \"Charlie\" is a constant. Here, \"it\" is not a constant, but refers to the subject. Therefore, in the sentence \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it,\" the \"it\" is the monkey that is doing the seeing. Wait, no. Let's think: when you say \"x saw a monkey that saw it,\" the \"it\" could be the same as the x. For example, if I say \"John saw a man that saw him,\" then \"him\" refers to John. So in this case, \"it\" refers back to the subject of the main clause. Therefore, in the sentence, for each monkey x, x did not see any monkey y such that y saw x. Therefore, the formula is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). Alternatively, maybe the sentence is saying that there's no monkey who saw a monkey that saw something else. But given the lack of context, the most logical interpretation is that \"it\" refers back to the first monkey. Therefore, the correct formalization would involve both Pxy and Pyx. \n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\" So the structure is: No monkeys (saw (a monkey that saw it)). So the \"a monkey that saw it\" is the object of \"saw.\" Therefore, for all monkeys x, it is not the case that x saw some y (monkey) such that y saw it. If \"it\" is x, then it's as I said before. Therefore, the formula is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"it\" is not x, but some other entity. But since the sentence is about monkeys, perhaps \"it\" refers to the same monkey. Let me think of an example. Suppose there's a monkey A. If A saw a monkey B that saw A, then the sentence says that this doesn't happen. Therefore, the correct formalization would be that there does not exist any monkey x such that there exists a monkey y where x saw y and y saw x. But since the original sentence starts with \"No monkeys,\" which is a universal quantifier, it's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence can be interpreted as: There is no monkey that saw any monkey which saw something. But that would be different. However, given the wording, \"it\" likely refers to the first monkey. \n\nTherefore, the final formula should be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). \n\nWait, but let me check again. The sentence is \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\" So \"No monkeys saw...\" means that for every monkey, they didn't see such a monkey. The \"monkey that saw it\" is a monkey y such that y saw it. If \"it\" is the same as the monkey doing the seeing (x), then y saw x. Therefore, the entire condition is that x saw a y (monkey) who saw x. Therefore, the formula is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the formalization would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Pxy \u2227 Pyx)). Alternatively, maybe the \"it\" refers to another entity, but since the sentence is self-referential in a way, it's more logical that \"it\" refers to the subject. Therefore, this should be the correct translation.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(Oy\u2227Pxy\u2227Pyx))",

The sentence is \"Every donkey kicked a human.\" So I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations: M for donkey, N for human, Q for kicked.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Every donkey\" suggests a universal quantifier. So for all x, if x is a donkey (Mx), then... what? The next part is \"kicked a human.\" So each donkey kicked at least one human. That sounds like an existential quantifier inside. So for each donkey x, there exists some y such that y is a human (Ny) and x kicked y (Qxy).\n\nPutting that together: For all x, if Mx then there exists y such that Ny and Qxy. So the structure would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u2203y(Ny \u2227 Qxy)). \n\nWait, let me check. The original sentence says every donkey kicked a human. So each donkey has some human that it kicked. Yes, that's correct. The universal quantifier on the donkey and existential on the human. The order of quantifiers matters here. If it were the other way around, it would mean there's a single human that all donkeys kicked, which isn't what the sentence says. So the correct structure is universal followed by existential.\n\nSo the formula should be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u2203y(Ny \u2227 Qxy)). Let me make sure I used the abbreviations correctly. M is [1] is a donkey, so Mx. N is [1] is a human, so Ny. Q is [1] kicked [2], so Qxy where x kicks y. Yes, that matches.

The example had \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becoming \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). Similarly here, it's every donkey (Mx) leads to existence of y where human (Ny) and kicked (Qxy).

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"No donkeys saw Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. It has two parts connected by \"and\": \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" and \"a monkey kicked Alfred.\" So I need to handle each part separately and then combine them with a logical conjunction (since it's \"and\").\n\nStarting with the first part: \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" The abbreviation for donkey is M (probably M for donkey, maybe from the Spanish 'mula' or just M as a symbol). The predicate for \"saw\" is P, where P is [1] saw [2]. Hazel is represented by c. So \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" translates to \"For all x, if x is a donkey, then x did not see Hazel.\" In logical terms, that would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxc). Because \"no donkeys\" means that for every donkey, they don't satisfy the condition of seeing Hazel.\n\nNow the second part: \"a monkey kicked Alfred.\" The abbreviation for monkey is O, and \"kicked\" is Q. Alfred is represented by a. The phrase \"a monkey\" suggests existence\u2014there exists some monkey that kicked Alfred. So that would be \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). Here, we use an existential quantifier because there's at least one monkey (y) such that y is a monkey and y kicked Alfred.\n\nNow, combining both parts with a conjunction. The entire sentence is saying both parts are true. So the full formula would be the conjunction of the two statements: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxc) \u2227 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qya). \n\nLet me double-check the abbreviations to make sure I didn't mix them up. M is for donkey, correct. P is [1] saw [2], so Pxc would be x saw c (Hazel), so \u00acPxc is correct for \"x did not see Hazel.\" O is monkey, Q is kicked, so Qya is y kicked a (Alfred). The variables x and y are different, which is fine because they're in separate quantifiers. Also, since one is universal and the other existential, they don't interfere with each other. \n\nI think that's all. The structure looks right: the first part is a universal statement denying the predicate, and the second is an existential assertion. Connected by \u2227 as the original sentence uses \"and.\"\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acPxc)\u2227\u2203y(Oy\u2227Qya)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is \"Every monkey will run or Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\" The abbreviations provided are O for [1] is a monkey, F for [1] will run, P for [1] saw [2], and the constants a (Alfred) and b (Lewis). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is \"Every monkey will run OR Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\" The \"OR\" here is a logical disjunction (\u2228). \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Every monkey will run.\" That sounds like a universal quantifier. So, for all x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x will run (Fx). So that would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Fx). \n\nThen the second part: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\" The abbreviation P is [1] saw [2], but the sentence uses \"doesn't see\". Since P is in the past tense (\"saw\"), but the sentence says \"doesn't see\" which is present tense. Wait, maybe there's a typo or maybe I need to assume that P is for \"sees\" regardless of tense? The problem says to use the abbreviations given. The user provided P as \"[1] saw [2]\" but the sentence says \"doesn't see\". Hmm. Maybe the tense isn't crucial here, or perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"see\" is intended to be represented by P regardless of tense. Since the problem says to use the given abbreviations, I have to use P here. So \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" would be \u00acPab. Because Pab would mean \"Alfred saw Lewis\", but the sentence says \"doesn't see\". So we negate it: \u00acPab.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is the disjunction of these two parts. So the formalization would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Fx) \u2228 \u00acPab.\n\nWait, but in predicate logic, when combining quantifiers with other statements using connectives, the scope matters. The original sentence is \"Every monkey will run OR Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\" The \"or\" is at the top level, so the entire universal statement is one disjunct, and the negated Pab is the other. So the correct structure is (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Fx)) \u2228 (\u00acPab). Since there's no ambiguity here, and the quantifier applies to the first part, and the second part is a simple negation. \n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any other parts. Let me check the abbreviations again. O is monkey, F is will run, P is saw, a is Alfred, b is Lewis. The sentence uses \"doesn't see\", which is the negation of \"sees\". But the abbreviation P is \"saw\". Assuming that \"see\" and \"saw\" are being treated as the same here, perhaps the tense isn't important for the predicate. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended P to represent \"sees\" in general, and the tense in the abbreviation is just part of the label. Since the user provided P as \"[1] saw [2]\", but the sentence uses \"doesn't see\", maybe it's supposed to be present tense. However, since we have to use the given abbreviations, perhaps we just use P regardless of tense. Therefore, \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is \u00acPab. \n\nSo the final formula is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Fx) \u2228 \u00acPab. I should write it without parentheses around the quantifier part? Well, in standard syntax, the quantifier's scope is everything to the right unless parentheses are used. But since the disjunction is between two statements, the universal quantifier's scope is just Ox \u2192 Fx, and then the disjunction is outside. So the formula is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Fx) \u2228 \u00acPab. \n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check again. The original sentence is an \"or\" between two propositions: \"Every monkey will run\" and \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\". Each of those is translated as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Fx) and \u00acPab. So combining them with \u2228 gives the correct translation. \n\nI think that's all. No other quantifiers or connectives needed. The answer should be \u2200x(Ox\u2192Fx)\u2228\u00acPab.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Fx)\u2228\u00acPab",

The sentence is: \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are P for \"saw\", a for Alfred, N for \"is a human\", R for \"chased\", and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The key part here is \"only if\". In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the statement is \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel.\" So the \"A\" here is \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\", and the \"B\" is \"a human chased Hazel\".\n\nSo, the main implication would be: If Alfred doesn't see Alfred, then a human chased Hazel. That would be \u00acP(a,a) \u2192 (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 R(x,c))). Wait, let me check. The original says \"a human chased Hazel\", which implies there exists at least one human who chased Hazel. So the consequent should be an existential quantifier: there exists an x such that x is a human (Nx) and x chased Hazel (Rxc). \n\nBut let me make sure about the \"only if\" direction. The phrase \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So if the sentence was \"Alfred is happy only if it rains\", that would be Happy(a) \u2192 Rain. Similarly here, the antecedent is the negation of Alfred seeing Alfred. So \u00acP(a,a) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 R(x,c)).\n\nIs there any other part to consider? The original sentence is \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel.\" So the entire antecedent is the negation of P(a,a), and the consequent is the existence of a human who chased Hazel. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if I need to use universal quantifiers anywhere. The consequent is about existence, so existential. The antecedent is a specific statement about Alfred not seeing himself, so no quantifier there. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formula should be \u00acP(a,a) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 R(x,c)). \n\nWait, the abbreviations: P is \"[1] saw [2]\", so P(a,a) would be Alfred saw Alfred. The sentence says \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\", so that's \u00acP(a,a). The consequent is \"a human chased Hazel\". \"A human\" implies existence, so \u2203x(Nx \u2227 R(x,c)). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula is \u00acPaa \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). Using the abbreviations correctly, with the constants and predicates as given. I don't see any other elements needed here. No need for universal quantifiers in the consequent because it's stating the existence of at least one human who chased Hazel. \n\nTherefore, the formalization should be \u00acPaa \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc).\n</think>\n\n\u00acPaa \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis is a donkey.\" And we have the abbreviations provided. I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then [some consequent].\" The consequent is \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis is a donkey.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc), since M is \"[1] is a donkey\" and P is \"[1] saw [2]\", with c being Hazel. So \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is the negation of that, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc) because the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential with the negated implication. But maybe the original form is better here unless we need to convert it. But I think either form is acceptable, but let's stick with the negation of the universal for now.\n\nNow the consequent: \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Lewis is a donkey.\" The \"only if\" part is important. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, for each monkey, if the monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey. So the consequent is saying that for all monkeys, if they chased Hazel, then Mb (since b is Lewis and M is being a donkey). \n\nSo putting it all together: The entire statement is a conditional where the antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) and the consequent is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ry c \u2192 Mb)). Wait, O is \"[1] is a monkey\", R is \"[1] chased [2]\", so for a monkey y, if they chased Hazel (c), then Mb.\n\nSo the whole formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 [\u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ry c \u2192 Mb))]\n\nBut let me check if I need to use the abbreviations correctly. The abbreviations are:\n\nM: [1] is a donkey (so Mx is \"x is a donkey\")\n\nP: [1] saw [2], so Pxc is \"x saw c (Hazel)\"\n\nc: Hazel\n\nO: [1] is a monkey (Oy is \"y is a monkey\")\n\nR: [1] chased [2], so Ry c is \"y chased c (Hazel)\"\n\nb: Lewis, so Mb is \"Lewis is a donkey\" (since M is donkey and b is Lewis).\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the structure is correct. The main connective is the implication. The antecedent is the negation of the universal statement. The consequent is a universal quantifier over monkeys, each leading to a conditional that if they chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey.\n\nAnother way to write the consequent is \u2200y\u2200z (Oy \u2227 Ryz \u2192 (z=c \u2192 Mb))? No, wait, no. The Hazel is fixed here. The \"chased Hazel\" is Ry c, because the second argument of R is Hazel (c). So the consequent is \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ry c \u2192 Mb)).\n\nSo combining all, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ry c \u2192 Mb))\n\nAlternatively, the antecedent could be written as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc), but the problem allows either form as long as it's well-formed. However, since the example uses the universal form (e.g., \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), maybe it's better to stick with the negation of the universal here. But both forms are logically equivalent.\n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations given, and there's no indication that we need to convert to another form. So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) is acceptable.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 (Ry c \u2192 Mb))\n\nNow, checking for proper syntax. Quantifiers should be followed by variables, and the connectives are properly used. The variables x and y are used, which are okay as long as they are consistent. Also, c and b are constants. The structure seems correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: the scope of the quantifiers. The antecedent is a negation of a universal, and the consequent is a universal. The variables are properly bound. The only free variable would be in the antecedent, but since it's a conditional, the entire formula is closed (no free variables) because all variables are bound by quantifiers. Wait, the antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(...), which is a closed formula, and the consequent is \u2200y(...), also closed. So the entire implication is a closed formula. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 (Ryc \u2192 Mb))\n\nWait, in the consequent, Ry c is written as Ryc? In the example, they used Rxc where x is the first argument and c the second, so yes. The abbreviation R is \"[1] chased [2]\", so Ry c is \"y chased c\", which is written as Ryc. So the formula is correct.\n\nYes, that should be it.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc)\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192(Ryc\u2192Mb))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"No donkeys saw Lewis and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. It has two parts connected by \"and\": \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" and \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" I'll handle each part separately and then combine them with a conjunction.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"[1] is a donkey\" and P for \"[1] saw [2]\". The name Lewis is represented by 'b'. So, \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" means that there does not exist a donkey that saw Lewis. In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" is typically translated as \u00ac\u2203x(Ax \u2227 Bx). So here, it would be \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Pxb). Alternatively, it could also be expressed as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb), which says for all x, if x is a donkey, then x did not see Lewis. Both forms are equivalent, but I need to check which one is more appropriate. Since the original uses \"No...\", maybe using the negation of an existential is better. But both are correct. Let me note that.\n\nNow the second part: \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviations for monkeys are O: \"[1] is a monkey\" and Q: \"[1] kicked [2]\". The name Lewis is still 'b'. \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" translates to the negation of \"All monkeys kicked Lewis.\" The universal quantifier for \"All monkeys kicked Lewis\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). So the negation is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). However, in predicate logic, the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential with a negation. So \u00ac\u2200x(...) is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00ac...). Therefore, \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) is equivalent to \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). So the second part can be written either as \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) or \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the problem expects one or the other. The original sentence uses \"not all,\" which directly corresponds to \u00ac\u2200x(...), but sometimes it's preferable to push the negation inside. However, both are logically equivalent. I'll need to decide which form to use based on standard conventions. The example given in the problem uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" so following that, maybe for the second part, using the negation of the universal is acceptable. But let me check.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is the conjunction of the two parts. So the first part is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Pxb) or \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb), and the second part is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) or \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). The example uses the universal implication for \"Every linguist...\", so maybe for consistency, the first part should be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb). Let me confirm: \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is equivalent to \"For every donkey, it is not the case that it saw Lewis,\" which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb). That seems right. The second part, \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" can be written as \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). But the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, and both forms are standard. However, since the example uses a universal implication, perhaps for the first part I should use the universal and for the second part use the negation of a universal. Wait, but the second part is a negation of a universal. Let me think. The example's translation was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So if the original sentence says \"not all monkeys...\", that would be the negation of the universal, so \u00ac\u2200x(...). But perhaps the problem expects that form. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the second part expressed as an existential. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n[\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb)] \u2227 [\u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb)]\n\nAlternatively:\n\n[\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb)] \u2227 [\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb)]\n\nWhich one is correct? Both are equivalent, but which is preferred? The problem says to use standard syntax. The example uses the universal implication, so maybe the second part should be expressed as the negation of a universal, which is \u00ac\u2200x(...). However, sometimes in formal logic, people prefer to avoid having a negation directly in front of a universal, so they might convert it to an existential. But since the problem allows both, and the example uses the universal form for the positive statement, perhaps here we can use the negation of the universal. However, the problem says to use the given abbreviations. Let me make sure that the abbreviations are used correctly. For the second part, \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" would be \"It is not the case that all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). So that's correct. Alternatively, \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb) is also correct. But the problem might prefer one over the other. Let me check the example again. The example's translation was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So for \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" the direct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). But maybe the answer expects that. However, in some logic courses, they prefer to have the negation pushed inside, so \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). Let me think. The example uses a universal, so perhaps the answer should use the same structure. But the second part is a negation of a universal, so perhaps it's acceptable. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo the first part is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb), and the second part is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). Then the entire formula is their conjunction: [\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb)] \u2227 [\u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb)].\n\nAlternatively, if I use the existential for the second part, it would be [\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb)] \u2227 [\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb)]. Which is correct? Both are correct, but perhaps the problem expects the second part to be in the form that uses the existential. Let me think again. The original sentence says \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" The phrase \"not all\" is a direct negation of the universal quantifier, so \u00ac\u2200x(...). However, in formal logic, it's often preferred to have the formula in prenex normal form or to avoid double negations. But since the problem doesn't specify, either form is acceptable. However, looking at the example, the example uses the universal implication. So maybe for consistency, the answer should use \u00ac\u2200x(...) for the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the second part to be written as an existential. Let me check the abbreviations again. The abbreviations for the second part are O: [1] is a monkey, Q: [1] kicked [2]. So \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is equivalent to \"There exists a monkey who did not kick Lewis.\" So \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). That's another way to write it. Which is better? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are standard. However, the example uses a universal implication, so perhaps the answer should follow that pattern. Wait, but the example is for a universal statement. The second part here is a negation of a universal. So perhaps it's acceptable to have \u00ac\u2200x(...). But maybe the problem expects the answer to use the existential form. Let me think about how to write it. Let's see:\n\nOriginal sentence: \"No donkeys saw Lewis and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\"\n\nFirst part: No donkeys saw Lewis. So \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Pxb) or \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb). Both are correct. The example uses the universal form, so maybe we should use that.\n\nSecond part: not all monkeys kicked Lewis. So \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). Alternatively, \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). Which is better? Well, if the problem allows both, but the example uses the universal, perhaps the answer should use the negation of the universal. However, in formal logic, sometimes people prefer to have the negation as part of the quantifier. But I think both are acceptable. Let me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" \u2192 \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So for the second part, if it's \"not all\", then the direct translation is \u00ac\u2200x(...). So perhaps that's acceptable. Therefore, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb)\n\nBut let me make sure that the conjunction is correctly placed. The original sentence is the conjunction of the two parts, so we need to connect them with \u2227. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, if the second part is written as an existential, then:\n\n\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb) \u2227 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb)\n\nWhich is also correct. But which one is expected here? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are standard. However, the example uses the universal form, so perhaps the answer should follow the same pattern. However, the second part is a negation of a universal, so perhaps it's better to leave it as \u00ac\u2200x(...). But I need to make sure that the answer is in the form that the problem expects. Since the example uses the universal for the positive statement, and the second part is a negation of a universal, maybe that's acceptable. However, sometimes in formal logic, people prefer to avoid having a negation immediately before a quantifier. But that's not a rule. Both forms are correct. Let me check if there's any other consideration. For example, in the example, they used \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). So depending on which form is more straightforward. Since the problem says \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is a direct negation of \"all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is \u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb), then the correct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb). Therefore, that's the correct way. So combining both parts, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the syntax is correct. The formula is a conjunction of two formulas. The first is a universal quantifier, the second is a negation of a universal quantifier. Yes. So that's the correct formalization. Alternatively, if the second part is converted to an existential, it's also correct. But since the problem allows either form, and the example uses the universal, perhaps the answer should follow the same structure. Therefore, I think the correct answer is:\n\n\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb)\n\nBut let me check again. Another way to think about \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is \"For all x, if x is a donkey, then x did not see Lewis,\" which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxb). The second part is \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is \"It is not the case that for all x, if x is a monkey, then x kicked Lewis,\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). Therefore, combining them with \u2227 gives the entire formula. Yes. So that's the correct translation.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acPxb) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"No humans are hungry or a monkey will attack\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence has two parts connected by \"or\". The first part is \"No humans are hungry\", and the second part is \"a monkey will attack\". The structure seems to be \"Either it's not the case that some humans are hungry, or there exists a monkey that will attack.\"\n\nStarting with \"No humans are hungry\". The standard way to express \"No A are B\" in predicate logic is \u2200x(Ax \u2192 \u00acBx). So here, A is being a human (N), and B is being hungry (L). So that part would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). \n\nThen the second part is \"a monkey will attack\". This sounds like there exists at least one monkey that will attack. Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and G is \"[1] will attack\". So this would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Gx). \n\nNow, the original sentence is \"No humans are hungry or a monkey will attack.\" The \"or\" connects these two parts. So the entire formula should be the disjunction of the two parts. So combining them with \u2228: (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) \u2228 (\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Gx)).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the \"or\" is correctly placed. The original sentence is structured as \"No humans are hungry OR a monkey will attack.\" So the \"or\" is at the top level, meaning either the first part is true, or the second part is true. So the way I have it is correct. \n\nLet me check if there's any ambiguity. The sentence could be read as \"It is not the case that (humans are hungry) OR (a monkey will attack)\", but that's not the case. The original is \"No humans are hungry or...\", which suggests that the first part is a universal statement. Also, the structure \"No A are B or C\" would typically be parsed as (No A are B) \u2228 C, but I need to make sure. However, in this case, the second part is a separate clause. \n\nAnother way to think: \"No humans are hungry\" is a universal statement, and then \"or a monkey will attack\" is an existential. So combining them with OR. So the correct formalization is indeed the disjunction of \u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx) and \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Gx). \n\nI don't see any other way to parse it. So the final formula should be \u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx) \u2228 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Gx). \n\nLet me check the abbreviations again. N is [1] is a human, L is [1] is hungry, O is [1] is a monkey, G is [1] will attack. Yes, that's correct. \n\nNo quantifier scope issues here. The \u2200x is only over Nx\u2192\u00acLx, and the \u2203x is only over Ox \u2227 Gx. The variables are separate in each part. So the formula is well-formed.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx)\u2228\u2203x(Ox\u2227Gx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel is hungry only if every monkey is asleep.\" And we need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. The main structure seems to be a conditional: If [A], then [B only if C]. Let me parse that. In logic, \"if A then B only if C\" might be a bit tricky. Wait, \"only if\" usually translates to an implication where the consequent is necessary for the antecedent. So \"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. But here, the whole thing is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", so that would be A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Alternatively, maybe it's structured as A \u2192 (B \u2194 C)? Wait, no. Let me think again. The original sentence is: If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel is hungry only if every monkey is asleep. So, the \"only if\" part is between Hazel's hunger and monkeys being asleep. So, the structure is: If H, then (Lc only if \u2200m Om \u2192 Jm). Wait, let me get the abbreviations right.\n\nThe abbreviations are:\nN: [1] is a human\nR: [1] chased [2]\nb: Lewis\nL: [1] is hungry\nc: Hazel\nO: [1] is a monkey\nJ: [1] is asleep\n\nSo the sentence is: If a human chased Lewis (so \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rx b)), then (Hazel is hungry (Lc) only if every monkey is asleep (\u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy))). \n\nWait, the \"only if\" here: \"Hazel is hungry only if every monkey is asleep\" translates to Lc \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy). Because \"only if\" introduces a necessary condition. So if Hazel is hungry, then it must be that every monkey is asleep. So that part is Lc \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy). \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire statement is: If there exists a human who chased Lewis, then (Lc \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy)). \n\nBut how to structure the antecedent? The antecedent is \"a human chased Lewis\", which is an existential statement. So \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). Then the consequent is Lc \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy). Therefore, the whole formula is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Jy)).\n\nWait, but sometimes in logic, implications with quantifiers can be tricky. Let me check if there's a way to simplify or rephrase. Also, note that the consequent is a material implication. So the entire formula is: \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2200y (Oy \u2192 Jy)).\n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to use the given structure. Since the original sentence is structured as \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C), so we should stick with that.\n\nNow, check if all abbreviations are used correctly. \n\n- \"a human chased Lewis\": Lewis is 'b', so someone (x) such that Nx (human) and Rxb (chased Lewis). Correct.\n\n- \"Hazel is hungry\" is Lc, since c is Hazel. Correct.\n\n- \"every monkey is asleep\": For all y, if Oy (is a monkey) then Jy (is asleep). Correct.\n\nSo the formula should be: \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2200y(Oy \u2192 Jy)).\n\nBut let me make sure there are no parentheses issues. Also, in predicate logic, the order of operations might require parentheses. Let me structure it properly:\n\nThe main connective is the implication: [\u2203x(...)] \u2192 [Lc \u2192 \u2200y(...)]. So written with proper parentheses:\n\n(\u2203x (N x \u2227 R x b)) \u2192 (L c \u2192 \u2200y (O y \u2192 J y))\n\nYes. That seems correct. Also, variables can be reused, but in the existential quantifier, x is bound, and in the universal quantifier, y is bound. So that's fine. \n\nI think that's the correct formalization. Let me check again the original sentence. The antecedent is an existential (\"a human\" implies existence), and the consequent is a conditional where Hazel's hunger requires all monkeys asleep. Yes. So the formula should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192(Lc\u2192\u2200y(Oy\u2192Jy))",

The sentence is \"A donkey chased a donkey that chased a donkey.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"is a donkey\" and R for \"chased\". I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using those symbols.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is that there's a donkey (let's call it Donkey A) that chased another donkey (Donkey B), and Donkey B chased a third donkey (Donkey C). So it's a chain of two chases: A \u2192 B \u2192 C, all being donkeys.\n\nIn predicate logic, existential quantifiers (\u2203) will be needed here because the sentence uses \"a donkey\" each time, which implies existence but not uniqueness. So, we need to assert that there exist three donkeys where each chases the next.\n\nLet me break it down. The first part is \"There exists a donkey A such that...\" which would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 ...). Then, within that, \"A chased a donkey B that chased a donkey.\" So, for B, it's another \u2203y (My \u2227 Rxy \u2227 ...). And then for B chasing C, another \u2203z (Mz \u2227 Ryz). Putting it all together, the formula should link these existentials with the appropriate relations.\n\nWait, let me check the order. The original sentence is \"A donkey (A) chased a donkey (B) that chased a donkey (C).\" So B is the one that chased C. So the structure is:\n\n\u2203x \u2203y \u2203z ( Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz )\n\nBut wait, do we need to make sure that all three are donkeys? Yes, because each \"a donkey\" in the sentence refers to an existence of a donkey. So each of x, y, z must satisfy M.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no overlap or uniqueness required. The sentence doesn't specify that they are distinct, but in natural language, when you say \"a donkey that chased a donkey,\" it's possible that B could be the same as C? Hmm, but in the sentence \"A chased a donkey that chased a donkey,\" the \"that\" introduces a relative clause modifying the second donkey. So B is a donkey that chased another donkey (C). So B and C must be different? Or can they be the same?\n\nIn formal logic, unless specified, they can be the same. So the formula allows for y = z. But the original sentence might imply three different donkeys. However, since the problem doesn't specify that they are distinct, I shouldn't add that. So the correct approach is to use three existential quantifiers, each for x, y, z, with Mx, My, Mz, and the relations Rxy and Ryz.\n\nTherefore, the formalization would be:\n\n\u2203x \u2203y \u2203z ( Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz )\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original sentence is \"A donkey chased a donkey that chased a donkey.\" So the structure is:\n\nThere exists a donkey x such that x chased a donkey y, and y chased a donkey z. So yes, exactly as above. Each of x, y, z must be a donkey, and the relations are Rxy and Ryz. So the formula is correct.\n\nBut let me check if the order of the quantifiers is right. Since each existential is introduced in sequence. So \u2203x \u2203y \u2203z (...). Alternatively, sometimes people write them as a single block, like \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(...), but the example given in the problem uses \u2200x(...), so probably the correct way here is to nest them. However, in predicate logic, multiple quantifiers can be written in sequence. The example shows \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is a single quantifier. But for multiple existentials, it's standard to have them next to each other. So \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(...).\n\nSo the final formula is \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz). \n\nI think that's it. Let me check if there's any other connectives needed. The sentence is a conjunction of the three M's and the two R's. So yes, all connected by \u2227. No implications here because we are asserting the existence of entities that satisfy these predicates and relations. That seems right.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(Mx \u2227 My \u2227 Mz \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryz)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this logic problem. The sentence is: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless not all donkeys will attack.\" The abbreviations given are P for \"[1] saw [2]\", a for Alfred, b for Lewis, M for \"[1] is a donkey\", and G for \"[1] will attack\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The structure is \"A doesn't see B unless not all donkeys will attack.\" The word \"unless\" often translates to a logical implication. In English, \"A unless B\" usually means \"If not B, then A\". But here it's \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless not all donkeys will attack.\" So maybe it's structured as \"Not P(a,b) unless \u00ac(all donkeys attack)\". Wait, \"unless\" can sometimes be tricky. Let me think again.\n\nThe original sentence can be rephrased as: If all donkeys will attack, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis. Because \"unless\" introduces a condition that, if not met, leads to the main clause. So \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"If not B, then A\". Applying that here: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless not all donkeys will attack\" becomes \"If it is not the case that not all donkeys will attack, then \u00acP(a,b)\". Wait, that seems confusing. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me rephrase the sentence. \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless [condition].\" The condition here is \"not all donkeys will attack.\" So the \"unless\" condition is the part that, if false, would make the main statement false. So, \"Unless C, not P(a,b)\" translates to \"If \u00acC, then \u00acP(a,b)\". Wait, no. Let me recall that \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\". But here, the main clause is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\", which is \u00acP(a,b). The \"unless\" part is \"not all donkeys will attack.\" So maybe it's \u00acP(a,b) \u2228 \u00ac(all donkeys will attack). But the original sentence says that Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless the condition holds. So if the condition is false (i.e., all donkeys will attack), then Alfred must not see Lewis. Therefore, the implication is: If all donkeys will attack, then \u00acP(a,b). \n\nAlternatively, using the \"A unless B\" structure where A is the main clause and B is the exception. So \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\". But here, the main clause is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\", so A is \u00acP(a,b), and B is \"not all donkeys will attack\". Therefore, the entire statement would be \u00acP(a,b) \u2228 \u00ac(all donkeys will attack). But in logic, this can also be written as: If it is not the case that not all donkeys will attack, then \u00acP(a,b). Which simplifies to: If all donkeys will attack, then \u00acP(a,b). \n\nNow, translating \"all donkeys will attack\" into predicate logic. \"All donkeys will attack\" is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx). Therefore, the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx), which is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acGx). But in our case, the condition is \"not all donkeys will attack\", which is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nSo putting it together, the original sentence can be formalized as: If all donkeys will attack, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis. Which is:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(a, b)\n\nBut wait, the original sentence says \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless not all donkeys will attack.\" So the \"unless\" is followed by the negation of the antecedent. Let me check again. If we use the structure \"A unless B\" as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\", then here A is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" (\u00acP(a,b)), and B is \"not all donkeys will attack\" (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)). Therefore, the translation would be \u00acB \u2192 A, which is \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). Simplifying \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(...)) gives \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). So the implication is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). \n\nYes, that matches what I had before. So the formalization is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(a, b). \n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Suppose someone interprets \"unless\" as \"A unless B\" being equivalent to \"A \u2194 \u00acB\". But I think that's not standard. Usually, \"A unless B\" is A \u2228 B, which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. So in this case, \u00acP(a,b) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx), which can be written as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2228 \u00acP(a,b), which is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization should be the implication from the universal statement about donkeys to Alfred not seeing Lewis. \n\nSo the final formula is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(a, b). \n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the abbreviations correctly. P is \"[1] saw [2]\", so P(a,b) is \"Alfred saw Lewis\". The original sentence says \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\", which is \u00acP(a,b). The donkey part is \"all donkeys will attack\" is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). So yes, the implication is correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it: The sentence is saying that the only way Alfred sees Lewis is if not all donkeys will attack. So if Alfred does see Lewis (P(a,b)), then it must be that not all donkeys will attack (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)). Which is the contrapositive: P(a,b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). But that's equivalent to the previous statement. Because (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA). So both forms are acceptable, but which one matches the original structure?\n\nOriginal sentence: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless not all donkeys will attack.\" So the \"unless\" is attached to the negative statement. So \"unless B\" here is the condition for \u00acP(a,b). So the correct form is \u00acP(a,b) unless B, which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). Wait, no. Let me think again. If we have \"A unless B\", then it's A \u2228 B. So in this case, \"\u00acP(a,b) unless B\", where B is \"not all donkeys will attack\". Therefore, \u00acP(a,b) \u2228 B, which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). Wait, no. \u00acP \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 \u00acP? Wait, no. Let me recall that A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. Wait, no, A \u2228 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. Wait, if you have A \u2228 B, that's equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. So in this case, if we have \u00acP \u2228 B, then that's equivalent to P \u2192 B. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me use symbols. Let me let A be \u00acP(a,b), and B be \"not all donkeys will attack\". Then the sentence is A unless B. Which is A \u2228 B. Which is equivalent to \u00acA \u2192 B. But \u00acA is P(a,b). So the implication is P(a,b) \u2192 B. Which would be: If Alfred sees Lewis, then not all donkeys will attack. Which is equivalent to the contrapositive: If all donkeys will attack, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis. Which is the same as before. \n\nSo both forms are equivalent. However, the problem is to formalize the original sentence. Depending on how we structure the translation, either form is acceptable. However, the example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier with an implication. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So perhaps the expected answer here is the implication form. \n\nSo between P(a,b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) and \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b), which is preferable? Both are logically equivalent. But perhaps the former would be more direct if we structure it as \"If Alfred sees Lewis, then not all donkeys attack.\" But the original sentence is phrased as \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless not all donkeys attack,\" which seems to directly link the negation of seeing to the condition. \n\nBut in the example, the translation uses the universal quantifier. The example's sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which is a universal statement. Here, the sentence is a conditional involving a universal. Given that, perhaps the expected answer is the implication with the universal on the left. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the negation of the universal. Let me check the exact wording again. The original sentence is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless not all donkeys will attack.\" The \"unless\" is followed by \"not all donkeys...\", which is the negation of the universal. So using the \"A unless B\" structure where B is the negation of the universal. \n\nGiven that, the correct formalization would be \u00acP(a,b) \u2228 B, where B is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx). Which is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(a, b). \n\nI think that's the right way to go. Let me check for any possible mistakes. For example, are there any scope issues? The quantifier is in the antecedent of the implication, which is fine. The formula is well-formed. The abbreviations are used correctly. \n\nYes, so the final answer should be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)\u2192\u00acPab, using the abbreviations a and b for Alfred and Lewis. Since in the example, they used Lx\u2192Rxc, with the variables. So the correct formula is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acP(a, b). In symbols, that would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)\u2192\u00acPab. \n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)\u2192\u00acPab",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"Not all donkeys ate.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations: M for [1] is a donkey and I for [1] ate.\n\nFirst, I remember that \"Not all\" usually translates to the negation of a universal quantifier. In logic, \"All A are B\" is \u2200x(Ax\u2192Bx). So \"Not all A are B\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ax\u2192Bx). Alternatively, this can also be expressed as \u2203x(Ax \u2227 \u00acBx), which means there exists at least one A that is not B. Both forms are equivalent due to the rules of quantifier negation.\n\nApplying this to the given sentence: \"Not all donkeys ate.\" So \"All donkeys ate\" would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). Therefore, negating that gives \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). But maybe the preferred form here is using the existential quantifier. Let me check. The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so both forms are correct, but perhaps the most direct translation of \"Not all\" is the negation of the universal. However, sometimes in logic, it's more standard to convert it to the existential form. Let me recall the equivalence: \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP. So \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix) is equivalent to \u2203x\u00ac(Mx\u2192Ix). But then, \u00ac(Mx\u2192Ix) is equivalent to Mx \u2227 \u00acIx. Therefore, the existential form would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). \n\nSo which one should I use? The example given in the problem uses the universal form. For instance, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the original sentence was \"Not all...\", the direct translation would be the negation of that universal. However, in some contexts, using the existential might be preferable. But the problem says to use standard syntax. Both are correct, but perhaps the expected answer is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the existential form. Let me think again. The example uses the universal, but the original sentence here is a negation. The user might expect the negation of the universal. However, in formal logic, both are acceptable. Let me check if there's any specific instruction here. The instructions say to use the abbreviations given and return a single well-formed formula. Both forms are well-formed. However, perhaps the answer expects the negated universal. Let me see. The example uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So if the sentence was \"All donkeys ate\", it would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). Therefore, \"Not all donkeys ate\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). That's straightforward. Alternatively, using \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx) is also correct. Which one is preferred? The problem might prefer the existential form because it's more explicit about the existence of a donkey that didn't eat. However, the example uses the universal, so maybe the negation of the universal is the way to go here. Let me check standard practice. In formal logic, both are correct. However, sometimes the negation of the universal is written as \u00ac\u2200... but sometimes converted to the existential. The problem's example uses the universal form. Since the user provided that example, maybe they want the negation of the universal here. Let me go with that. So the answer would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). Alternatively, if they prefer the existential, it's \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). But which is correct? Let me think again. The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys ate.\" In English, this can be interpreted as \"It is not the case that every donkey ate,\" which is the negation of the universal statement. However, in predicate logic, the standard way to express this is with the existential quantifier. But both are equivalent. However, in some logic textbooks, the preferred form is to push the negation in, so converting \u00ac\u2200 to \u2203\u00ac. But since the problem's example uses the universal form for the positive statement, maybe the negation is just the negation of that. Let me check the example again. The example's sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). If the sentence were \"Not every linguist admires Charlie,\" then the correct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). However, another correct way is \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). But perhaps the answer here is expecting the negation of the universal. However, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are well-formed. But maybe the user expects the negation of the universal. Let me check the problem's example again. The example uses the universal for the positive statement. The current problem is a negation of that positive statement. So the direct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). However, in some contexts, people might prefer the existential form. But unless there's a specific instruction, either is correct. But given that the example uses the universal, maybe the answer is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). However, I need to make sure that the syntax is correct. The negation symbol comes before the quantifier? No, the quantifier is \u2200, and the negation applies to the entire universal statement. So it's \u00ac\u2200x(...). Yes. So the formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). Alternatively, \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). Which is correct? Both are correct. But maybe the problem expects the first one. However, in formal logic, when you negate a universal, you can convert it to an existential. Since the problem says to use standard syntax, perhaps either is acceptable, but I need to choose one. Let me think about the example again. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). If the sentence had been \"Some linguist does not admire Charlie,\" then it would be \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). But \"Not all...\" is equivalent to \"There exists at least one that does not.\" Therefore, the correct formalization would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). However, the problem's example uses the universal for \"every,\" and the negation of that would be the existential. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer here is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). But why does the example use the universal? Because the original sentence was a universal. Here, the original is a negation. So maybe the answer is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). But which is more standard? In logic, both are acceptable. However, in some cases, the existential form is preferred because it's more explicit. Let me check with another example. Suppose the sentence is \"Not all students passed.\" Abbreviations: S: [1] is a student, P: [1] passed. Then, the formalization could be \u00ac\u2200x(Sx\u2192Px) or \u2203x(Sx \u2227 \u00acPx). Both are correct. But if the user's example uses the universal form for the positive, then perhaps for the negative, they expect the negation of that. Therefore, the answer would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). However, if the user expects the existential, then \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx). How to decide? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax. Both are standard. However, perhaps the answer is the existential form because it's more direct. Let me think again. The sentence \"Not all donkeys ate\" is logically equivalent to \"There exists a donkey that did not eat.\" Therefore, translating it directly as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acIx) would be correct. However, the problem's example uses the universal quantifier for the positive statement. But the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both are well-formed. Maybe the answer is the negation of the universal. Let me check the problem's example again. The example's sentence is \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" which is a universal, and the formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). If the sentence were \"Not every linguist admires Charlie,\" then the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). But which one is expected here? The problem's instructions don't specify, so I need to choose. Given that the example uses the universal for the positive, and the problem here is the negation, the direct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). However, in many logic textbooks, when you negate a universal, you convert it to an existential. But unless told to do so, the direct translation is to negate the universal. Therefore, the answer is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). However, maybe the problem expects the existential form. Let me think again. The problem's example is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). If the user wanted the existential form, why didn't they use that in the example? Because the example was a universal statement. Therefore, the answer here should be the negation of the universal. So the correct formalization is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix). Therefore, I will go with that.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Ix)",

The sentence is: \"If every human is asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if a human chased Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"[1] is a human\", J for \"[1] is asleep\", R for \"[1] chased [2]\", and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, let's parse the structure. The main conditional is \"If every human is asleep, then [something].\" The \"something\" here is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if a human chased Hazel.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"every human is asleep.\" In predicate logic, that would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So that part is straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if a human chased Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the \"A\" is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel,\" which is \u00acR(c, c). The \"B\" is \"a human chased Hazel,\" which is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 R(x, c)).\n\nPutting that together, the consequent would be \u00acR(c, c) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 R(x, c)). \n\nSo combining the antecedent and consequent, the entire statement is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acR(c, c) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 R(x, c))). \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the structure is correct. Let me check again. The original sentence is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Here, B is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" and C is \"a human chased Hazel.\" So yes, that would be A \u2192 (\u00acR(c,c) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 R(x,c))). \n\nAnother thing to verify: the use of \"only if\". The phrase \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if a human chased Hazel\" means that if Hazel didn't chase herself, then there must be a human who chased her. So the implication is in that direction. So \u00acR(c,c) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 R(x,c)). That seems right.\n\nSo the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acR(c,c) \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 R(x,c)))\n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers and connectives are properly placed. Also, check that all abbreviations are used correctly. N is for human, J for asleep, R for chased, and c is Hazel. Yes, that's all correct here. No variables are missing, and the structure is a conditional with the antecedent being the universal statement and the consequent being another conditional.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is \"Every monkey kicked Lewis and only humans drank.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"is a monkey,\" Q for \"kicked,\" b for Lewis, N for \"is a human,\" and H for \"drank.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The sentence has two parts connected by \"and.\" The first part is \"Every monkey kicked Lewis,\" and the second part is \"only humans drank.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Every monkey kicked Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, O(x) would represent \"x is a monkey,\" and Q(x, b) would be \"x kicked Lewis\" since b is Lewis. The universal quantifier \u2200x applies here, so the structure would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow the second part: \"only humans drank.\" The phrase \"only humans\" suggests that if someone drank, they must be a human. In logical terms, this is a universal statement as well. So, for all x, if H(x) (x drank), then N(x) (x is a human). So that would be \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Nx). \n\nPutting the two parts together with the conjunction \"and,\" the entire formula should be the conjunction of these two universal statements. So the final formula would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u2200x (Hx \u2192 Nx). \n\nWait, but I need to check if there's any overlap in variable usage or if I need to use different variables for each quantifier. Since both are universally quantified and the variables are bound within their own scopes, using the same variable x in both should be acceptable. In predicate logic, each quantifier has its own scope, so the x in the first part is separate from the x in the second part. So combining them with \u2227 is correct.\n\nLet me double-check the second part. \"Only humans drank\" means that drinking is exclusive to humans. So, anyone who drank must be a human. That's correctly captured by Hx \u2192 Nx. There's no need for a biconditional here because the statement doesn't say that all humans drank, just that only humans did. So if someone drank, they are a human, but there might be humans who didn't drink. So the implication is correct.\n\nAlso, the original sentence uses \"and\" to connect the two clauses, so the conjunction is appropriate. There's no existential quantifier needed here because both parts are universal. \n\nI don't see any other abbreviations needed. The constants and predicates provided are sufficient. The only constant is b (Lewis), which is correctly used in the first part. The rest are predicates. \n\nSo combining everything, the formalization should be the conjunction of two universal statements. The first about monkeys kicking Lewis, the second about drinkers being humans. \n\nTherefore, the final formula is \u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb) \u2227 \u2200x(Hx\u2192Nx).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb) \u2227 \u2200x(Hx\u2192Nx)",

So the overall form is P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe antecedent P is \"Alfred won't attack.\" Since G is \"[1] will attack,\" then \"Alfred won't attack\" would be \u00acG(a). So P is \u00acGa.\n\nThe consequent Q is \"every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" Let's parse this part. The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So if we have \"Every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel,\" this would mean that for all monkeys, if they are hungry, then Hazel kicked Hazel. \n\nSo Q is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) only if Q(cc)? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"every monkey is hungry only if [something].\" So the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the A in \"A only if B\". Therefore, the whole statement would be: If every monkey is hungry, then Hazel kicked Hazel. But how to express \"every monkey is hungry\" as the antecedent?\n\nWait, \"every monkey is hungry\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). Then \"only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" would make it \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Q(cc). Because \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So the consequent Q of the main conditional is ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nPutting it all together, the main conditional is \u00acGa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nBut wait, implication is right-associative? Or do I need parentheses? Let me check. The main structure is If P, then (Q \u2192 R). So in logic, that's P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R). Which is equivalent to P \u2192 (\u00acQ \u2228 (\u00acQ \u2228 R))? No, more directly, P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R) is the same as (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 R. But for the purposes of formalization, we just need to represent it as is.\n\nSo the entire formula would be \u00acGa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence is: If Alfred won't attack, then [every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel]. The \"only if\" connects \"every monkey is hungry\" with \"Hazel kicked Hazel\". So \"every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" is equivalent to \"If every monkey is hungry, then Hazel kicked Hazel.\" Which is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc. Therefore, the entire translation is \u00acGa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nBut maybe I can simplify this. Since A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to return a well-formed formula in standard syntax. So perhaps it's acceptable as is. Alternatively, maybe the user expects it written as (\u00acGa) \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nBut I need to make sure all the parts are correctly represented. Let me check each component again:\n\n- \"Alfred won't attack\" is \u00acG(a), which is \u00acGa.\n\n- \"every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" becomes \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Q(cc). Because \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" is Q(c, c).\n\nYes. So putting them together, the entire formula is \u00acGa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to interpret it. For example, could \"every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" be read as \"For every monkey, if it is hungry, then Hazel kicked Hazel\"? That would be \u2200x [ (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Qcc ].\n\nWait, that's different. Let me think. The original statement is \"every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" applies to each instance. So for each monkey, being hungry only if the condition holds. So maybe it's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 Qcc))? Which would be equivalent to \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Qcc ). But that's different from the previous approach where the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The phrase \"every monkey is hungry only if B\" can be ambiguous. Let me think about the logic of \"only if\". \n\nIn general, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if A is a statement like \"All monkeys are hungry\", then \"All monkeys are hungry only if B\" would be (All monkeys are hungry) \u2192 B. Which is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 B.\n\nAlternatively, if it's \"Every monkey is hungry only if B\", then for each monkey, being hungry requires B. Which would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 B ). Which is equivalent to \u2200x ( Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 B) ). \n\nSo which is the correct interpretation here? The original sentence is \"every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" is modifying the entire \"is hungry\" for each monkey, but the condition is a single B. So for each monkey, if it is hungry, then B must be true. Therefore, the correct translation would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Qcc ), which can be written as \u2200x ( Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 Qcc) ). \n\nBut how does that compare to the previous approach? If we have \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc, that would mean that if all monkeys are hungry, then Qcc. But if we have \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 Qcc)), that's equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2227 Lx \u2192 Qcc). Which is different. \n\nSo which one is correct? Let's take an example. Suppose there are two monkeys. If the original statement is \"Every monkey is hungry only if B\", then:\n\n- If both monkeys are hungry, then B must be true. \n\nBut with \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 B)), then for each monkey, if it's hungry, B must be true. Therefore, if any monkey is hungry, B must be true. Therefore, if all are hungry, B must be true. But also, if even one is hungry, B must be true. Whereas the first approach (the entire \"all are hungry\" implies B) would require that only when all are hungry does B need to be true. But the original sentence says \"every monkey is hungry only if B\". Which is more like \"If every monkey is hungry, then B\". But perhaps the correct interpretation is that for each monkey, being hungry requires B. Let me check with some references.\n\nIn logic, \"only if\" in a universal statement. For example, \"Every A is B only if C.\" This is ambiguous. However, in formal logic, \"only if\" typically introduces a necessary condition. So \"Every A is B only if C\" would mean that for every x, if x is A and x is B, then C. But since C is a statement that doesn't involve x, then if there's any A that is B, then C must be true. Which is equivalent to ( \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)) ) \u2192 C. \n\nAlternatively, if it's \"Every A is B only if C\", maybe it's intended to mean that for every A, if it is B, then C. Which would be \u2200x ( (A(x) \u2227 B(x)) \u2192 C ). \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The problem is that \"only if\" can be a bit ambiguous in such contexts. \n\nLooking back at the example given in the problem statement: The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" Abbreviations: L: \"[1] is a linguist\", R: \"[1] admires [2]\", c: Charlie. The formalization is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the structure is \"Every [subject] [verb] [object]\" becomes \u2200x (subject(x) \u2192 verb(x, object)).\n\nIn the current problem, the structure is similar but with \"only if\". Let's consider the original sentence again: \"every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\" \n\nLet me think of \"only if\" as a conditional. So \"Every monkey is hungry only if B\" is equivalent to \"If a monkey is hungry, then B\". But wait, that would be for each monkey. Wait, but B is a general condition (Hazel kicked herself). So if any monkey is hungry, then B must be true. Therefore, \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 Qcc ). Which can be written as \u2200x ( Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 Qcc) ). \n\nAlternatively, if the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent, then ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 Qcc. \n\nWhich one is correct? Let's look for similar examples. For example, consider the sentence \"Everyone passes only if the exam is easy.\" This could be interpreted in two ways. Either (1) If everyone passes, then the exam is easy. Or (2) For everyone, if they pass, then the exam is easy. In this case, both interpretations are logically equivalent because if every individual's passing implies the exam is easy, then if everyone passes, the exam must be easy. Conversely, if whenever everyone passes the exam is easy, then for any individual, if they pass (assuming others also pass?), but that might not hold. Wait, actually, (2) implies (1), but (1) does not imply (2). For example, if the exam is easy, then everyone passes. So if (1) is true, then whenever everyone passes, the exam is easy. But if (2) is true, then for any individual, their passing implies the exam is easy. Therefore, (2) is stronger. However, in natural language, \"Everyone passes only if the exam is easy\" is usually taken to mean (1), that the exam being easy is a necessary condition for everyone passing. \n\nBut in formal logic, how is this typically handled? It's ambiguous, but perhaps the intended interpretation here is that the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent. Therefore, translating it as ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 Qcc. \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The original sentence is: \"If Alfred won't attack, then every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\"\n\nIf we take the \"only if\" to mean that the entire consequent of the main conditional is ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc ), then the whole formula is \u00acGa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc ). \n\nAlternatively, if we take it as the consequent being \u2200x ( (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc ), but that doesn't make sense because \"only if\" is between \"hungry\" and \"Hazel kicked...\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to treat \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 Qcc)), which is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2227 Lx \u2192 Qcc). \n\nSo which is it? Let's see. The example given in the problem uses a universal quantifier with an implication. For example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). Similarly, \"Every monkey is hungry\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx). \n\nNow, the phrase \"every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" would be similar to \"Every A is B only if C\". In logic, this is usually formalized as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 B(x)) \u2192 C. Because \"only if\" introduces a necessary condition for the entire universal statement. \n\nFor example, if we say \"Every student passed only if the exam was easy\", it would mean that if every student passed, then the exam was easy. Which is \u2200x (Student(x) \u2192 Passed(x)) \u2192 Easy. \n\nTherefore, applying that to our case, \"every monkey is hungry only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" becomes ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 Qcc. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acGa \u2192 [ ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) ) \u2192 Qcc ].\n\nSo that's the translation. Therefore, the final answer should be \u00acGa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc ). \n\nBut to make sure, let's check if there are any parentheses issues. In predicate logic, the scope of quantifiers and implications need to be clear. The consequent of the main implication is ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc ). \n\nYes, that's correct. So the formula is:\n\n\u00acGa \u2192 ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx) \u2192 Qcc )\n\nWhich is a well-formed formula. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa\u2192(\u2200x(Ox\u2192Lx)\u2192Qcc)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"Every donkey is happy or a monkey will attack.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure seems to be \"Every donkey is happy or a monkey will attack.\" Wait, the \"or\" here is a bit tricky. Is it that for every donkey, either it is happy or there's a monkey that will attack? Or is it that either all donkeys are happy or there's a monkey that will attack? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But in formal logic, the placement of the quantifiers matters a lot.\n\nLooking at the example given, when the sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" it was translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the structure is \"for all x, if x is a linguist, then x admires Charlie.\" Applying that here, \"Every donkey is happy\" would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). Now, the original sentence adds \"or a monkey will attack.\" So the entire sentence is saying that either every donkey is happy, or there's a monkey that will attack. Wait, but the way it's phrased could be ambiguous. Is it \"Every donkey is (happy or a monkey will attack)\" or \"(Every donkey is happy) or (a monkey will attack)\"?\n\nIn English, sometimes the scope of \"or\" can be unclear. But given the structure, I think it's more likely the second interpretation: that the entire statement is a disjunction between two parts: \"Every donkey is happy\" OR \"a monkey will attack.\" Because if it were the first, it would mean that for each donkey, either it is happy or some monkey attacks. But that might be a different meaning. The original sentence says \"Every donkey is happy or a monkey will attack.\" The placement of \"or\" suggests that the entire first part is a universal statement, and the second is an existential one. \n\nSo breaking it down: The first part is \"Every donkey is happy,\" which is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx). The second part is \"a monkey will attack,\" which would be \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Gy). Because \"a monkey\" implies existence, and \"will attack\" is G. So combining these two with an \"or,\" the entire formula would be (\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)) \u2228 (\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Gy)).\n\nLet me check the abbreviations again. M is [1] is a donkey, K is [1] is happy. O is [1] is a monkey, G is [1] will attack. So yes, for the second part, there exists some entity that is a monkey and will attack. \n\nSo the formalization should be the disjunction of the universal statement and the existential statement. Therefore, the correct formula is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Gy). \n\nWait, but in predicate logic, the variables can be the same or different. Since x and y are bound variables, they don't interfere with each other. So using x in the universal quantifier and y in the existential is okay. Alternatively, could I use the same variable? Probably not necessary, since they are different quantifiers. So the formula should be correct as written. \n\nLet me make sure there's no other interpretation. If the original sentence was structured as \"Every donkey is (happy or (a monkey will attack))\", that would mean for each donkey, either it's happy or there's a monkey that will attack. In that case, the formula would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192(Kx \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Gy))). But that seems less likely given the original sentence. The original sentence is more naturally read as two separate clauses connected by \"or\": either all donkeys are happy, or there's a monkey that attacks. \n\nSo I think the correct formalization is the disjunction of the two statements. Therefore, the final formula is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx) \u2228 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Gy).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)\u2228\u2203y(Oy\u2227Gy)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless a monkey kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviations given are M for donkey, Q for kicked, a for Alfred, O for monkey, and b for Lewis. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless a monkey kicked Lewis.\" The phrase \"unless\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A unless B\" typically translates to \"If not B, then A.\" Alternatively, it can be seen as \"A \u2228 B\". But in this case, since it's \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless...\" maybe we need to think carefully.\n\nLet me rephrase the sentence. It's saying that if a monkey didn't kick Lewis, then no donkeys kicked Alfred. So the structure is: If not (a monkey kicked Lewis), then not (any donkeys kicked Alfred). \n\nBreaking it down, the main implication is: \u00ac(\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb)) \u2192 \u00ac(\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa)). Wait, but the original sentence is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless a monkey kicked Lewis.\" So the \"unless\" connects the two parts. The standard way to handle \"A unless B\" is B \u2228 A. So maybe here, the statement is equivalent to \"Either a monkey kicked Lewis or no donkeys kicked Alfred.\" \n\nBut let's check. If the sentence is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless B,\" then \"B\" is the condition that must be met for the \"no donkeys kicked Alfred\" to not hold. So if B is true (a monkey kicked Lewis), then it's possible that donkeys did kick Alfred? Wait, no. The original sentence says that the donkeys didn't kick Alfred unless that other condition is met. So if the monkey didn't kick Lewis, then the donkeys didn't kick Alfred. \n\nAlternatively, \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless...\" is equivalent to \"If a monkey kicked Lewis, then some donkey kicked Alfred?\" No, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe I should think of \"unless\" as \"if not.\" So \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless a monkey kicked Lewis\" becomes \"If it is not the case that a monkey kicked Lewis, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\" \n\nSo the implication is \u00ac(\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb)) \u2192 \u00ac(\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa)). But in predicate logic, we can write this as \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa) \u2228 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb). Wait, but the original structure is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless...\" which is equivalent to \"If a monkey didn't kick Lewis, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\" \n\nAlternatively, using material implication, we can write the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If not B, then not A\" is \"If A, then B.\" So if there exists a donkey that kicked Alfred, then there must exist a monkey that kicked Lewis. \n\nSo the formalization could be: \u2200x (Mx \u2227 Qxa \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb)). Wait, but that's not quite right. Because the contrapositive of \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is A \u2192 B. So if A is \"there exists a donkey that kicked Alfred\" (i.e., \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa)), then the contrapositive would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb). \n\nSo the correct translation would be that if there is any donkey that kicked Alfred, then there must be a monkey that kicked Lewis. Therefore, the formula is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb). \n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless a monkey kicked Lewis.\" So \"unless\" here is like \"if not,\" so the sentence is equivalent to \"If a monkey didn't kick Lewis, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\" Which is equivalent to \"If there is no monkey that kicked Lewis, then there is no donkey that kicked Alfred.\" \n\nTranslating that directly: \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa). Which is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxa) \u2228 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb). But in predicate logic, implications are often expressed with universal quantifiers. Alternatively, the contrapositive of the implication is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb), which is the same as before. \n\nSo both forms are logically equivalent. However, the contrapositive might be a more straightforward way to write it. So the final formula would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb). \n\nBut wait, the original sentence says \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless...\" which is a universal statement. So maybe it's better to use a universal quantifier. Let me think again. The statement is about all donkeys not kicking Alfred unless the condition is met. \n\nAnother approach: For every donkey, if it kicked Alfred, then a monkey must have kicked Lewis. So \u2200x ( (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) ). This is equivalent to the previous existential form because if any donkey kicked Alfred, then there's a monkey... So this universal quantifier approach might be more precise. \n\nYes, because the original sentence is a universal statement about donkeys. So the correct formalization would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Qxa \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb))). Which can be rewritten as \u2200x ( (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) ). \n\nThis seems correct. So the formula is \u2200x ( (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) ). \n\nAlternatively, using the contrapositive, it's equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) \u2192 \u00acQxa)), but that's more complicated. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x ( (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) ). \n\nLet me check the example given. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So for each linguist x, x admires Charlie. Similarly, in our case, for each donkey x, if x kicked Alfred, then there exists a monkey y who kicked Lewis. \n\nYes, that seems to align. So the correct formula is \u2200x ( (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) ). \n\nAlternatively, if we think of the entire \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless...\" as \"If a donkey kicked Alfred, then a monkey kicked Lewis,\" then the formula would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb). But the difference between using \u2200x and using \u2203x is important here. \n\nWait, if we use \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb), that's equivalent to the universal quantifier version. Because if every donkey that kicked Alfred implies the existence of a monkey, then if there exists any such donkey, the implication holds. So both forms are equivalent. However, in predicate logic, the universal form is more precise because it's about each individual donkey. \n\nBut the example uses a universal quantifier for \"Every linguist,\" which is a universal statement. Similarly, \"No donkeys kicked...\" is a universal statement about all donkeys. Therefore, the correct formalization would use the universal quantifier. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \u2200x ( (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) ). \n\nBut let me check for possible mistakes. Suppose there are two donkeys, D1 and D2. If D1 kicked Alfred, then a monkey must have kicked Lewis. Similarly for D2. The universal quantifier captures that. If we use the existential form, \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb), that's also correct because if any donkey did it, then the implication holds. But in predicate logic, both forms are equivalent. However, the example uses a universal quantifier for a similar structure. \n\nSo perhaps the answer is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Qxa \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb))). Which is the same as \u2200x ((Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb)). \n\nYes. So the final formula is \u2200x ( (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) ). \n\nAnother way to think: The original sentence is equivalent to \"If there is a donkey that kicked Alfred, then there is a monkey that kicked Lewis.\" Which would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb). But this is logically equivalent to the universal version. However, the example uses a universal quantifier for a similar structure, so perhaps the problem expects the universal form. \n\nBut in the example, the sentence is \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" which is a universal statement, so the translation uses \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). In our case, the sentence is about all donkeys not kicking Alfred unless... So the universal quantifier is appropriate here. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x ( (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) ). \n\nI think that's the right approach. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the direction of the implication. The original is \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless a monkey kicked Lewis.\" So if a monkey didn't kick Lewis, then no donkeys kicked Alfred. Which is equivalent to: If there exists a donkey that kicked Alfred, then there exists a monkey that kicked Lewis. So the implication is from the existence of a donkey kicking Alfred to the existence of a monkey kicking Lewis. \n\nYes, so \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb). \n\nBut again, the example uses a universal quantifier for a similar structure. However, the example is about all linguists, while the current problem is about donkeys not doing something unless a condition. \n\nBut in terms of logical structure, the example is a universal statement, and the current problem can also be expressed as a universal statement over donkeys. \n\nSo both forms are correct, but which one is expected? The example uses a universal quantifier, so perhaps the answer should follow that style. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \u2200x ( (Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyb) ). \n\nYes, that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x((Mx \u2227 Qxa) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyb))",

        },
        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey will attack.\" The abbreviations provided are O for \"[1] is a monkey\", L for \"[1] is hungry\", M for \"[1] is a donkey\", and G for \"[1] will attack\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The structure here is \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey will attack.\" The word \"unless\" usually translates to a logical implication with a negation. In English, \"A unless B\" can be read as \"If not B, then A\". So in this case, if it's not the case that every donkey will attack, then a monkey is hungry.\n\nNow, let's break down each part. The main connective here is \"unless\", which we'll handle as \u00acB \u2192 A. Here, A is \"A monkey is hungry\" and B is \"Every donkey will attack\".\n\nStarting with B: \"Every donkey will attack\". In predicate logic, \"every donkey will attack\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx). This is because for all x, if x is a donkey (Mx), then x will attack (Gx).\n\nThen, the negation of B would be \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx). However, in logic, the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential quantifier with the negated inner part. So \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx) is equivalent to \u2203x \u00ac(Mx \u2192 Gx). But maybe it's clearer to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x... for now, depending on how we structure the implication.\n\nNow, A is \"A monkey is hungry\". The phrase \"A monkey\" here is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean \"there exists a monkey that is hungry\" or \"for all monkeys, they are hungry\"? The original sentence is a bit ambiguous, but in formal logic, \"A monkey is hungry\" would typically be interpreted as \"There exists a monkey that is hungry\", which is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). However, sometimes in such sentences, it might be intended as a universal, but given the structure with \"unless\", I think it's more likely existential. Let me think again. If the sentence were \"A monkey is hungry unless...\", it's possible that it's stating that if the condition (every donkey attacks) isn't met, then there is at least one hungry monkey. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that all monkeys are hungry unless... Hmm. The original example given in the problem uses \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which was formalized as \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So in that case, the universal quantifier was used. However, the current sentence is \"A monkey is hungry unless...\", which is a bit different. The word \"a\" here might be existential. For example, \"A monkey is hungry\" could be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). But maybe in some contexts, it's universal. But without more context, I think \"A monkey is hungry\" is more naturally an existential statement. However, in formal logic, sometimes \"A\" can be ambiguous. Let me check. Suppose the sentence was \"A monkey is in the room.\" That would usually be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 InRoom(x)). So I think here, \"A monkey is hungry\" is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx).\n\nPutting it all together: The sentence is \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey will attack.\" So using the \"unless\" structure, which is \u00acB \u2192 A. So:\n\n\u00ac(\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx)) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx)\n\nBut let me make sure. The original sentence can be rephrased as: If it is not the case that every donkey will attack, then there is a monkey that is hungry. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the other way around? Let me check the logic of \"unless\". The general form is A unless B \u2261 A \u2228 B, but also equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. Let me confirm. For example, \"I will go unless it rains\" can be read as \"I will go if it does not rain\", which is \u00acB \u2192 A, where B is \"it rains\". Alternatively, it can be seen as \"I will go or it rains\", which is A \u2228 B. Both are logically equivalent. So in this case, \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey will attack\" would be equivalent to \"A monkey is hungry or every donkey will attack\", which is (\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx)) \u2228 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx). But the problem is to formalize it using the implication. However, the user's example used an implication (the example was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\"). But in the case of \"unless\", we need to choose between using the implication or the disjunction. Since the example uses implication, maybe here we should use the implication form. So the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx).\n\nBut wait, another way to think about \"unless\" is that \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"if not B, then A\". So yes, that would be \u00acB \u2192 A. So B here is \"every donkey will attack\", so \u00acB is \"not every donkey will attack\", and A is \"a monkey is hungry\".\n\nTherefore, the formula is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx).\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible interpretation. Suppose the sentence is saying that for any monkey, it is hungry unless every donkey will attack. That would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2228 \u2200y (My \u2192 Gy))). But that seems different from the original sentence. The original says \"A monkey is hungry unless...\", which is more likely about the existence of a monkey being hungry, not for all monkeys. But without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. However, given the example provided in the problem, where \"Every linguist...\" was formalized with a universal, but here the sentence starts with \"A monkey...\", which is different. Let me think again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" \u2192 \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So \"Every\" leads to a universal. Here, \"A monkey\" is more like \"There exists a monkey...\", so \u2203x (Ox \u2227 ...). \n\nSo going back, the main structure is that the existence of a hungry monkey is true unless all donkeys attack. So the formula is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). \n\nAlternatively, could the sentence be interpreted as \"If not every donkey will attack, then a monkey is hungry\", which is exactly what we have. So I think that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations. The abbreviations are O for \"is a monkey\", L for \"is hungry\", M for \"is a donkey\", G for \"will attack\". So the formula uses these correctly. The quantifiers and logical symbols are standard. So the final formula is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx). \n\nBut wait, the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. Let me make sure that I'm using them correctly. For example, G is \"[1] will attack\", so Gx would be \"x will attack\". So yes, Mx \u2192 Gx is \"if x is a donkey, then x will attack\". And Ox is \"x is a monkey\", Lx is \"x is hungry\". So \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx) is \"there exists a monkey that is hungry\".\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx)\n\nWhich is written in symbols as:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)\u2192\u2203x(Ox\u2227Lx)\n\nI need to make sure that the syntax is correct. The quantifiers are properly placed, and the parentheses are balanced. Let me check again:\n\n- The left side is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Gx)\n- The right side is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Lx)\n- The implication connects them.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer should be this formula.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)\u2192\u2203x(Ox\u2227Lx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If Alfred won't attack, then [a human chased Hazel only if no donkeys ate].\" So the overall form is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [something].\n\nNow, the \"something\" is \"a human chased Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So if we have \"A only if B,\" it's A implies B. But here, the A is \"a human chased Hazel,\" and B is \"no donkeys ate.\"\n\nWait, but \"a human chased Hazel\" is an existential statement? No, actually, \"a human\" here might be an existential quantifier. So \"a human chased Hazel\" would be \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)). Because there exists some x that is a human and x chased Hazel.\n\nThen, the \"only if no donkeys ate\" would mean that if there exists a human who chased Hazel, then it's the case that no donkeys ate. So putting that together: \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)). Because \"no donkeys ate\" is equivalent to saying there does not exist a donkey that ate, which can be written as \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)) or equivalently \u2200y (M(y) \u2192 \u00acI(y)).\n\nBut the \"only if\" structure requires that the existence of the human chasing Hazel implies the absence of donkeys eating. So the whole consequent of the main conditional is \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is \u00acG(a) \u2192 [\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y))]. \n\nWait, but in logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if there's a better way to structure this. The main conditional is \u00acG(a) leading to that implication. So the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)))\n\nAlternatively, using the contrapositive or other equivalences, but I think this is correct. Let me make sure there's no quantifier scope issues. The variables x and y are bound within their respective quantifiers, so that's okay. Also, the abbreviations are correctly used: G for will attack with a as Alfred, N for human, R for chased with c as Hazel, M for donkey, I for ate.\n\nAnother way to write \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)) is \u2200y (M(y) \u2192 \u00acI(y)), but since the user didn't specify a preference, either is acceptable. However, the original uses \"no donkeys ate,\" which is a universal statement. But in predicate logic, both forms are equivalent. However, since the example uses existential and universal quantifiers as needed, perhaps using the negation of an existential is more direct here. Let me stick with \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)) for simplicity.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acG(a) \u2192 (\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y)))\n\nI need to make sure that all the abbreviations are correctly applied. Let me check each part:\n\n- Alfred won't attack: \u00acG(a)\n- a human chased Hazel: \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, c))\n- no donkeys ate: \u00ac\u2203y (M(y) \u2227 I(y))\n\nYes, that's right. So the implication is that if Alfred doesn't attack, then if there's a human who chased Hazel, then there are no donkeys that ate. So the entire formula is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u00acGa\u2192(\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxc)\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(My\u2227Iy))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional: \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" Let's parse each part.\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and R is \"[1] chased [2]\". Hazel is represented by c. So the antecedent should be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent: \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, the \"A\" part is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\". Let's handle that.\n\n\"Not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is the negation of \"all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The original statement \"all donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc), where M is \"[1] is a donkey\" and Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\". So the negation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc). However, in predicate logic, \u00ac\u2200x becomes \u2203x\u00ac, so this is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc). Wait, is that right? Let me check. The negation of \u2200x(P\u2192Q) is \u2203x(P \u2227 \u00acQ). Yes, that's correct. So \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" becomes \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc).\n\nNow the \"only if\" part: \"Alfred saw Alfred.\" Alfred is a, and P is \"[1] saw [2]\". So \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is Paa.\n\nPutting the consequent together: The structure is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" As per \"A only if B\" being A \u2192 B, this would be (\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc)) \u2192 Paa.\n\nSo the entire sentence is the antecedent leading to the consequent: [\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc)] \u2192 [(\u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc)) \u2192 Paa].\n\nWait, but in the original sentence, the consequent is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.\" So the entire consequent is a conditional where the antecedent is \"not all...\" and the consequent is \"Alfred saw Alfred.\" So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. So the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 Paa)\n\nBut wait, earlier I converted \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc). But maybe it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) for clarity unless required otherwise. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations don't specify any particular form for the negation, so both forms are acceptable. However, since the user's example uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), perhaps keeping the negation as \u00ac\u2200x(...) is acceptable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should write the consequent as (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 Paa). But I need to check if that's equivalent to the \u2203x version. Since they are logically equivalent, either is fine. But perhaps the problem expects using the negation as is. Let me check the example again. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So when negating, it would be \u00ac\u2200x(...), which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the consequent is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 Paa. So the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 Paa)\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes it's better to restructure to avoid implications within implications if needed. But here, the structure is correct. Let me check the logic again.\n\nOriginal sentence: If A, then (B only if C). Which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's correct. So the translation is correct.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc) \u2192 Paa)\n\nBut need to make sure the parentheses are correct. The main implication is between the antecedent and the consequent. The consequent is itself an implication. So the parentheses should group correctly. Also, the quantifiers need to have their variables properly scoped. The first \u2200x applies to Ox \u2192 Rxc. The second \u2200x in the negation is a separate quantifier. Since variables are bound within their own quantifiers, using x again is okay here. But maybe using different variables? Wait, in the antecedent, we have \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxc), and in the consequent's \u00ac\u2200x(...), the x is a new bound variable. Since they are in different scopes, it's acceptable. So no problem with variable capture here.\n\nTherefore, the final translation is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc)\u2192Paa)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the sentence is: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred will run.\" \n\nLet me parse this. The main structure is a conditional statement: If A, then B. Where A is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" and B is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred will run.\" \n\nStarting with A: \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, R is [1] chased [2]. Since both are Hazel, it's Rcc. But since it's \"didn't chase,\" we need to negate it. So \u00acRcc.\n\nNow B: \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred will run.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. But here, the P part is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" Let's handle that first.\n\n\"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is the negation of \"all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" The statement \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa), since M is [1] is a donkey and Q is [1] kicked [2], with a being Alfred. So the negation would be \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa), but maybe the problem expects the direct negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nSo \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa). Then, this is the antecedent of the \"only if\" clause. The \"only if\" here is connecting this negation with \"Alfred will run,\" which is Fa (since F is [1] will run, and a is Alfred). \n\nSo \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred will run\" translates to \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 Fa. Wait, because \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So if P is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" then P \u2192 Q becomes \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 Fa.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire original sentence is: If \u00acRcc, then (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 Fa). \n\nSo the whole formula is \u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 Fa). \n\nBut wait, let me check the structure again. The main conditional is A \u2192 B, where B is itself a conditional. So the structure is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to parse the original sentence. Let me read it again: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred will run.\" The \"only if\" applies to the \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" part. So the \"only if\" is part of B. So B is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred will run,\" which as discussed is \u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 Fa. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula should be:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 Fa)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the inner part as \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2194 Fa? No, because \"only if\" is a one-directional implication. \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q, not a biconditional. \n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any other possible interpretations? For example, maybe the \"only if\" is part of the \"not all\" part. But I think the structure is that the entire \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is the P in \"P only if Q.\"\n\nSo I think the translation is correct. Now, let's make sure we are using the abbreviations correctly. \n\nR is [1] chased [2], so Rcc is Hazel chased Hazel. The negation is \u00acRcc. \n\nM is [1] is a donkey. Q is [1] kicked [2]. a is Alfred. So \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) is \"All donkeys kicked Alfred.\" The negation is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa). \n\nF is [1] will run, so Fa is Alfred will run. \n\nPutting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 Fa)\n\nI need to make sure that the parentheses are correctly placed. The main connective is the implication from \u00acRcc to the rest. The rest is another implication: the negation of the universal statement implies Fa. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the final answer should be that formula. Let me check if there's any alternative way to represent the same thing. For example, sometimes implications can be rephrased with other connectives, but the problem asks for standard syntax, so using the implications as they are is fine. \n\nAnother thing: The problem says to use the abbreviations given. I think I did that correctly. Let me verify each symbol:\n\n- R is used as Rcc for Hazel (c) chasing Hazel (c), negated.\n- Mx is correct for donkey.\n- Qxa is correct for donkey (x) kicking Alfred (a).\n- Fa is correct for Alfred will run.\n\nYes. So the formalization should be:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 Fa)\n\nAlternatively, since implications are right-associative, but in standard logic, parentheses are needed. So the parentheses around the inner implication are necessary. \n\nI think that's the correct translation.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 Fa)",

So, the sentence is \"Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure is an \"if and only if\" statement. That means it's a biconditional (\u2194). The left side is \"Alfred didn't chase Hazel,\" and the right side is \"Lewis saw Hazel.\"\n\nLooking at the abbreviations provided: R is [1] chased [2], so \"Alfred chased Hazel\" would be R(a, c). But since it's \"didn't chase,\" I need to negate that. So \u00acR(a, c).\n\nThen the other part is \"Lewis saw Hazel.\" The abbreviation for saw is P, so P(b, c). Because Lewis is [1] and Hazel is [2], right? The abbreviations say P: [1] saw [2], so yes, P(b, c).\n\nPutting it all together with the biconditional, it should be \u00acR(a, c) \u2194 P(b, c). Wait, is there any quantifiers here? The original sentence doesn't have any \"all\" or \"there exists\" phrases, so probably no quantifiers needed. Just a straightforward biconditional between the two propositions.\n\nLet me check again. The sentence is about Alfred not chasing Hazel exactly when Lewis saw Hazel. So the formalization should directly connect those two statements with \u2194. No need for quantifiers since all the subjects are specific individuals (Alfred, Lewis, Hazel). So the final formula is \u00acR(a, c) \u2194 P(b, c). \n\nI think that's it. Let me make sure the abbreviations are correctly applied. R is for chasing, with the first argument as the chaser and the second as the chasee. Similarly, P is seeing. The names a, b, c correspond correctly.

The sentence is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\", a for Alfred, c for Hazel, M for \"[1] is a donkey\", and P for \"[1] saw [2]\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the main structure would be \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" implies \"every donkey saw Hazel.\"\n\nBreaking it down: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" is the antecedent. Using the abbreviation Q, this would be \u00acQ(a, c). The consequent is \"every donkey saw Hazel.\" For \"every donkey,\" we use a universal quantifier. So \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Px), but wait, Hazel is the one being seen. So the saw part should be P(x, c), since [1] is the subject (the donkey) and [2] is Hazel. So the consequent is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication is \u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)). \n\nWait, but let me check if I got the direction of the implication right. \"Only if\" is different from \"if\". If the sentence was \"A only if B\", then A can only happen if B is true. So it's equivalent to A \u2192 B. So if Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel, then the non-kicking is conditional on the donkeys seeing Hazel. So yes, the structure is correct: if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then all donkeys saw her. \n\nAnother way to think about it: The statement is saying that the only scenario where Alfred didn't kick Hazel is when every donkey saw her. Wait, no, actually \"only if\" sets B as a necessary condition for A. So A can only be true if B is true. Which translates to A \u2192 B. So in this case, if Alfred didn't kick Hazel (A), then B (every donkey saw Hazel) must hold. So the translation is correct.\n\nSo the final formula should be \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). Let me check the abbreviations again. Q is [1] kicked [2], so Qac is Alfred kicked Hazel. The negation is correct. Mx is x is a donkey. Pxc is x saw Hazel. The universal quantifier over x with Mx implies Pxc. That all looks right. So combining these with the implication gives the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00acQac\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If every monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis is a donkey only if no donkeys ate.\" The abbreviations given are O for monkey, P for saw, b for Lewis, M for donkey, and I for ate. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B.\" So A is \"every monkey saw Lewis,\" and B is \"Lewis is a donkey only if no donkeys ate.\" Let's handle each part separately.\n\nStarting with A: \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"every monkey\" translates to a universal quantifier over all x where O(x) (x is a monkey) implies P(x, b) (x saw Lewis). So that would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb).\n\nNow, the consequent B: \"Lewis is a donkey only if no donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, \"Lewis is a donkey\" (which is M(b)) only if \"no donkeys ate.\" So that would be Mb \u2192 (no donkeys ate). \n\nNow, \"no donkeys ate\" translates to the negation of the existential quantifier. That is, \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Because if there's no donkey that ate, then for all donkeys, they didn't eat. Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx), but the negation of \u2203 is \u2200 with negation. However, since in the implication, we have Mb leading to this, it's better to use the negated existential here.\n\nPutting B together: Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). \n\nNow combining A and B with the main conditional. The entire statement is A \u2192 B. So:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix)).\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, conditionals can sometimes have scope issues. Let me check again. The original sentence is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which we translated as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). That's correct because \"if A then (B \u2192 C)\" is the right way to structure it.\n\nAnother way to write \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). But the former might be more direct here. However, both are equivalent. Since the problem says to use the standard symbols, either is acceptable. Let me stick with \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) because it directly negates the existence of a donkey that ate.\n\nSo the full formula would be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxb) \u2192 (Mb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nNow, checking the abbreviations again to make sure I used the right letters. O is monkey, P is saw, b is Lewis, M is donkey, I is ate. Yes, that's correct.\n\nI need to ensure that the quantifiers are properly scoped. The first part is a universal quantifier for all monkeys. The consequent has another implication where the antecedent is Mb and the consequent is the negation of the existential. \n\nI think that's all. Let me write it in the correct syntax without any extra spaces or formatting issues. The final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192(Mb\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Ix))\n\nYes, that looks right. Let me double-check for any parentheses issues. The main connective is the implication between the two parts. The first part is \u2200x(...), which is a single formula. The second part is another implication. So the whole thing is a conditional with two formulas as antecedent and consequent. Parentheses are correctly placed to group each part. No free variables here. The 'x' in the second part is bound by the existential quantifier, which is inside a negation. All good.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxb)\u2192(Mb\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Ix))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem. The sentence is: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviations given are M for [1] is a donkey, Q for [1] kicked [2], c for Hazel, O for [1] is a monkey, and b for Lewis.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into two parts connected by \"and\". The first part is \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The second part is \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" Let me handle each part separately.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\" In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" is typically translated as \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 \u00acB(x)). Here, A is \"is a donkey\" (Mx) and B is \"kicked Hazel\" (Qx c). So, the first part would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxc). That makes sense because for every x, if x is a donkey, then it did not kick Hazel.\n\nNow the second part: \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" The phrase \"not all\" is the negation of \"all\". \"All monkeys kicked Lewis\" would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). Therefore, the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). However, in predicate logic, the negation of a universal quantifier can be expressed as an existential quantifier with the negated inner statement. So, \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) is equivalent to \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). This means there exists at least one monkey who did not kick Lewis.\n\nPutting the two parts together with \"and\", which is the logical conjunction \u2227. So the entire formula should be the conjunction of the first part and the second part. Therefore, combining them:\n\n\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxc) \u2227 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb)\n\nWait, let me double-check the second part again. The original is \"not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" So \"all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). The negation is \u00ac\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). But is there another way to represent this? Alternatively, using the equivalence between \u00ac\u2200 and \u2203\u00ac. So, \u2203x \u00ac(Ox \u2192 Qxb). But Ox \u2192 Qxb is equivalent to \u00acOx \u2228 Qxb. The negation of that is Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb. So yes, \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb) is correct. So the second part is indeed \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb).\n\nTherefore, combining both parts with \u2227, the entire formula is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acQxc) \u2227 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb). \n\nLet me check if the abbreviations are used correctly. The abbreviations given are M for donkey, Q for kicked [2], c is Hazel, so Qxc is \"x kicked Hazel (c)\". For the second part, O is monkey, b is Lewis, so Qxb is \"x kicked Lewis (b)\". Yes, that's correct. So the translation looks right. \n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers and connectives are properly placed. The first part uses a universal quantifier with implication, and the second part uses an existential with conjunction. That's standard for these types of translations. \n\nSo the final formula should be: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acQxc) \u2227 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acQxb)\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acQxc)\u2227\u2203x(Ox\u2227\u00acQxb)",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred will run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. The antecedent A is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" and the consequent B is \"Alfred will run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa), since M is [1] is a donkey, and Q is [1] kicked [2], with a being Alfred. So \"not all\" would be the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa), because if it's not the case that all donkeys kicked Alfred, there must exist at least one donkey that didn't kick him. But I think either form is acceptable, though sometimes negations of universals are better left as negated universals unless needed to convert. However, maybe I should stick with the negation of the universal here.\n\nNow the consequent is \"Alfred will run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" part is important. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, \"Alfred will run\" (which is Fa, since F is [1] will run) only if \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" part would be similar to the antecedent. Let's break that down. \"All donkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc), since c is Hazel. So \"not all\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc), or equivalently \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc). \n\nSo putting the consequent together: Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc). Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"Alfred will run only if [not all donkeys kicked Hazel].\" So that's Fa \u2192 [not all donkeys kicked Hazel]. Which would be Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc).\n\nSo the entire conditional is: If [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa)], then [Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc)].\n\nSo the whole formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc)).\n\nBut maybe I can simplify this. Also, sometimes it's preferable to use existential quantifiers instead of negated universals. Let me check if that's necessary here. Let me see: the antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa). By logical equivalence, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxa). Similarly, the consequent's \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc) which is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxc). However, whether to use one form or the other depends on how the problem is structured. Since the problem allows using the given abbreviations, maybe it's better to stick with the negated universal form unless instructed otherwise. The example given in the problem uses a universal with implication inside, so perhaps following that style is better here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the main formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Let me check if I can write this correctly. The antecedent is the negated universal, and the consequent is Fa implying another negated universal.\n\nAlternatively, I can also consider that \"only if\" is a material implication, so the structure is correct. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the direction. \"Alfred will run only if [condition]\" translates to \"If Alfred runs, then [condition].\" So yes, Fa \u2192 [condition]. So that part is correct.\n\nSo the entire translation is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the variables are properly quantified. In the antecedent, the x is bound by the universal, and in the consequent, there's another universal with x. Wait, but in the consequent, the \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x(...), which uses x again. Since variables can be reused as long as they are bound, this is acceptable. However, sometimes to avoid confusion, you might want to use different variables, but the problem doesn't specify that. Since both are quantified over x, and in different scopes, it's okay. For example, in the formula, the first \u2200x is negated, and the second \u2200x is also negated. Each occurrence of x is bound by their own quantifier. So that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxa) \u2192 (Fa \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nI should check if there are any parentheses issues. The main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. The consequent is itself an implication between Fa and the negated universal. So the parentheses are correctly placed.\n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations. The abbreviations are M for donkey, Q for kicked, a for Alfred, F for will run, c for Hazel. All are used correctly here. \n\nI think that's it. So the answer should be the formula as written.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxa)\u2192(Fa\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc))",

But here, the structure is \"not all donkeys will run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" Let me rephrase that: The statement is saying that the condition for \"not all donkeys will run\" is that \"no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So maybe it's equivalent to \"If not all donkeys will run, then no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" Wait, but \"only if\" flips it. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So the original part is \"not all donkeys will run\" only if \"no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So that would translate to (\u00ac\u2200M F) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203O Q). Wait, but let me check.\n\nLet me first handle the abbreviations. The abbreviations given are:\n\nL: [1] is hungry (so Lc would be Hazel is hungry)\nc: Hazel\nM: [1] is a donkey\nF: [1] will run\nO: [1] is a monkey\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\n\nSo the sentence structure is: If Lc, then [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) only if \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qy c)].\n\nWait, the original is \"not all donkeys will run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So \"not all donkeys will run\" is the antecedent in an \"only if\" construction. So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So A is \"not all donkeys will run,\" B is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" Therefore, the implication is: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qy c). But wait, \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qy c). \n\nBut let me think again: \"not all donkeys will run\" is equivalent to \"there exists a donkey that will not run,\" which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). But the original says \"not all donkeys will run,\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). So both expressions are equivalent. But when using \"only if,\" the structure is that the \"not all...\" is the A in A \u2192 B. \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire sentence is Lc \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qy c)]. \n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, maybe the \"only if\" part can be rephrased. Let me check if there's another way. The entire sentence is: If Hazel is hungry, then (the fact that not all donkeys will run) only if (no monkeys kicked Hazel). So the main implication is Lc \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc)) ) ].\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to combine these. Let me check if \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B, so yes. Therefore, the entire formula would be Lc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc)). \n\nBut maybe we can simplify the implications. Since A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So perhaps the formula can be rewritten as (Lc \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc). However, the original structure uses \"if...then\" followed by an \"only if,\" so the first form might be more accurate. But both are logically equivalent. However, the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Either way is correct, but perhaps the first form is more direct.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the contrapositive. The implication \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc) is equivalent to its contrapositive: \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx). Therefore, the entire statement would be Lc \u2192 [\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)]. But I need to check if that's equivalent. Let me think: Original is Lc \u2192 (A \u2192 B), where A is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) and B is \u00ac\u2203y(...). The contrapositive of A\u2192B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. So the original implication is equivalent to (Lc \u2227 A) \u2192 B, which is equivalent to Lc \u2192 (A \u2192 B). Either way, perhaps the first form is acceptable.\n\nNow, translating all parts:\n\n- Hazel is hungry: Lc\n- Not all donkeys will run: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx)\n- No monkeys kicked Hazel: \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qy c)\n\nPutting together the implication: If Lc, then (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc))\n\nSo the entire formula is:\n\nLc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc))\n\nAlternatively, using the contrapositive inside:\n\nLc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc))\n\nBut maybe we can write the inner implication as its contrapositive to make it look cleaner? Let me see. The inner part is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(...). Which is equivalent to \u2203y(...) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx). So the entire formula would be Lc \u2192 (\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx)). But is that correct? Let me check with logic.\n\nOriginal inner implication: If not all donkeys run, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. Contrapositive: If some monkeys kicked Hazel, then all donkeys will run. So yes. So the entire statement can be written as Lc \u2192 ( (\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc)) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) ). Which might be another valid way to express it.\n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The user might prefer one form over another, but both are logically equivalent. However, since the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax and not add explanations, I need to choose the correct form based on the structure of the original sentence.\n\nThe original sentence says \"not all donkeys will run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Therefore, the inner implication is \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(...). Therefore, the formula is Lc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc)).\n\nNow, let's check the quantifiers and variables. For the donkeys: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) means all donkeys will run. So \u00ac\u2200x(...) is not all, which is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acFx). Similarly, \u00ac\u2203y(...) is equivalent to \u2200y\u00ac(...), which would be \u2200y(\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acQyc), but since Oy is [y is a monkey], and Qyc is [y kicked Hazel]. So \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc) is \u2200y(\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acQyc), which is equivalent to \u2200y(Oy \u2192 \u00acQyc). \n\nBut the problem says to use the abbreviations as given. So perhaps we can write \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc) as it is, or convert it to \u2200y\u00ac(Oy \u2227 Qyc). But the user might prefer the former. \n\nPutting it all together, the formula is:\n\nLc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. So the entire formula is correct. However, sometimes people prefer to avoid nested implications if possible, but in this case, it's necessary. \n\nAnother check: The main connective is the implication from Lc to the rest. The rest is an implication from \u00ac\u2200x(...) to \u00ac\u2203y(...). So the structure is correct.\n\nNow, let's make sure all abbreviations are used properly. L is for being hungry, applied to c (Hazel). M is for being a donkey, F for will run. O is for being a monkey, Q is for kicked, with the second argument being c (Hazel). So Qyc is \"y kicked Hazel\".\n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\nLc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc))\n\nAlternatively, using the contrapositive inside:\n\nLc \u2192 (\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx))\n\nBut which one is correct based on the original sentence? The original says that \"not all donkeys will run only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Therefore, the first version is correct. \n\nBut let me check again. Suppose \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if A is \"not all donkeys will run\" and B is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\", then the implication is A \u2192 B. Therefore, the inner part is \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(...). Therefore, the entire formula is as written.\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\nLc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc))\n\nNow, to write this in the required syntax, using the symbols \u2200, \u2203, etc. So the final answer is:\n\nLc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc))\n\nBut I need to make sure that the variables are properly quantified. The x in Mx \u2192 Fx is bound by \u2200x, and the y in Oy \u2227 Qyc is bound by \u2203y. The negations are in front of the quantifiers. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the formula is well-formed.\n</think>\n\nLc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Qyc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"A human kicked Lewis or a monkey kicked Alfred.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is an \"or\" between two parts: \"A human kicked Lewis\" and \"a monkey kicked Alfred.\" So in logic, that would be a disjunction (\u2228) between the two statements.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"A human kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a human\" is N, and \"[1] kicked [2]\" is Q. Lewis is represented by b. So, \"A human kicked Lewis\" would involve an existential quantifier because it's saying there exists some human who kicked Lewis. So that would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Qxb). Wait, because we need to say there's an x that is a human (Nx) and that x kicked b (Lewis). \n\nThen the second part: \"a monkey kicked Alfred.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a monkey\" is O, and Alfred is a. So similarly, this would be \u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qya). \n\nNow, combining the two with an \"or,\" the entire formula should be (\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Qxb)) \u2228 (\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qya)). But since the variables x and y are in separate existential quantifiers, they can use the same variable letter, like x, because they are bound separately. So maybe it's better to write \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Qxb) \u2228 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxa). But using different variables is also okay, but since the problem doesn't specify, either way is correct. However, in formal logic, using different variables might be clearer, but it's not necessary here. \n\nSo the final formula would be the disjunction of the two existential statements. Let me check the abbreviations again to make sure. N is for human, Q is kicked, b is Lewis. O is monkey, a is Alfred. Yes. So putting it all together: \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Qxb) \u2228 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxa). Alternatively, using different variables for each existential, like \u2203x and \u2203y, but since they are separate quantifiers, the variables don't conflict. So both forms are acceptable. Probably the answer expects using the same variable, but I think either is correct. \n\nTherefore, the formalization should be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Qxb) \u2228 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxa). Or with different variables, but I think same variable is fine. So the final answer is that disjunction.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Qxb)\u2228\u2203x(Ox\u2227Qxa)",

        },
        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this logic translation problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the sentence says: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" Let's parse each part.\n\nStarting with the main structure. It's a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" Where A is \"not all humans are asleep\" and B is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nSo translating A: \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). But I'll keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) unless there's a reason to convert it. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll stick with the negation of the universal quantifier.\n\nNow for B: \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, P is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel,\" which is \u00acR(c, c). Wait, R is [1] chased [2], so Rcc would be Hazel chased Hazel. So \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is \u00acRcc. \n\nSo the \"only if\" part would be \u00acRcc \u2192 Q', where Q' is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nBut \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qx c). Because \"some monkeys kicked Hazel\" would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qx c), so the negation is that none did.\n\nPutting that together: B is \u00acRcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc), but the problem says to use the given abbreviations. The abbreviation Q is [1] kicked [2], so Qxc is x kicked c (Hazel). \n\nSo the entire B part is \u00acRcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). \n\nPutting A and B together: The entire statement is A \u2192 B, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc)). \n\nBut maybe I need to check if \"only if\" is correctly translated. The original says \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So if P is true, then Q must be true. So in this case, if Hazel didn't chase herself (\u00acRcc), then it must be that no monkeys kicked her (\u00ac\u2203x...). So the implication is \u00acRcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). \n\nBut wait, sometimes \"only if\" can be tricky. Let me think again. The structure \"A only if B\" is logically equivalent to A \u2192 B. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the entire formula is: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write the consequent as a biconditional? No, the sentence says \"only if\", not \"if and only if\". So it's a one-way implication. \n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations again. The abbreviations given are:\n\nN: [1] is a human\n\nJ: [1] is asleep\n\nR: [1] chased [2]\n\nc: Hazel\n\nO: [1] is a monkey\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\n\nSo all the parts are correctly using the abbreviations. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the order of the quantifiers and connectives. Let me write the entire formula again:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc))\n\nBut in formal logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can write the consequent as \u00acRcc \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc), since \u00ac\u2203x is equivalent to \u2200x\u00ac. But the problem says to use the given abbreviations, and the user might prefer the existential form negated. However, both are equivalent. But since the problem allows using standard logical symbols, either is acceptable. But the example uses existential quantifiers where appropriate. Let me see the example again. The example had \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So the example uses implication with universal quantifier. So perhaps for the \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\", it's better to write \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc) rather than \u2200x(Ox \u2192 \u00acQxc). Either is correct, but since the user didn't specify, I'll stick with the negated existential as that's the direct translation of \"no monkeys...\".\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acRcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc))\n\nNow, check if this is a well-formed formula. The structure is: If A then (B implies C). All variables are properly quantified. The abbreviations are correctly applied. \n\nYes, this should be correct. Let me make sure there are no typos. The antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx), the consequent is \u00acRcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). \n\nAnother point: the original sentence is a bit tricky because of the \"only if\" inside the conditional. But I think the structure is correct. The main conditional is \"If not all humans are asleep, then [Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if ...]\". Which translates to the main implication. \n\nI think that's it. The formula should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acRcc\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Ox\u2227Qxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is: \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Hazel kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The abbreviations given are M for donkey, P for saw, c for Hazel, Q for kicked, and I for ate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into parts. The main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, \"only if\" can be a bit tricky. Let me parse this correctly. The sentence says that if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then (Hazel kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate). \n\nLet me start with the antecedent: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" In predicate logic, \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). So the negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acPxc). But maybe I should keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) for now.\n\nThe consequent is a bit more complex: \"Hazel kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The \"only if\" here means that the kicking happened only if there were no donkeys that ate. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So, if Hazel kicked herself (Qcc), then it must be that no donkeys ate. \"No donkeys ate\" is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix), which is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx).\n\nPutting that together, the consequent would be Qcc \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). \n\nSo the entire implication is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Qcc \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx)). \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to structure this. The original sentence says \"Hazel kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" So that's indeed Qcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix), which is the same as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). So yes, the consequent is correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Qcc \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx))\n\nAlternatively, since the consequent is an implication, perhaps I can write it as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix) \u2192 Qcc)? Wait, no, because \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So the original structure is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So in this case, the antecedent is the \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\", and the consequent is \"Hazel kicked Hazel only if no donkeys ate\", which is Qcc \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Therefore, the entire formula is the antecedent implying that implication.\n\nSo I think the correct formalization is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Qcc \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx))\n\nBut I need to check if I can simplify or rephrase it using the abbreviations given. The abbreviations are M, P, c, Q, I. The user wants the formula in standard predicate logic syntax, using only those abbreviations.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that \"no donkeys ate\" can be written as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx), which is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Either form is acceptable, but since the user didn't specify, I can choose either. The example uses \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), so maybe using universal quantification is preferable here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Qcc \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx))\n\nI need to make sure there are no typos. Let me check again:\n\n- \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Pxc).\n- \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" is Qcc.\n- \"No donkeys ate\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx).\n- The consequent is Qcc \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx).\n- The entire implication is the antecedent leading to that.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Pxc)\u2192(Qcc\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acIx))",

The sentence is \"Hazel chased a human.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, the abbreviations provided are N for \"[1] is a human\", R for \"[1] chased [2]\", and c is \"Hazel\". So Hazel is represented by the constant c.\n\nThe sentence says Hazel chased a human. So Hazel is the subject (the one doing the chasing), and the object is some human. In predicate logic, this would involve an existential quantifier because it's saying there exists a human that Hazel chased.\n\nBreaking it down: \"Hazel chased a human\" can be read as \"There exists an x such that x is a human and Hazel chased x.\" \n\nUsing the abbreviations: \n- \"x is a human\" is N(x) or Nx.\n- \"Hazel chased x\" would be R(c, x) since R is [1] chased [2], so the first argument is Hazel (c), and the second is x.\n\nSo putting it together, we have \u2203x (Nx \u2227 R(c, x)). \n\nWait, but the order in R is [1] chased [2], so Hazel is the first argument. So R(c, x) is correct. \n\nYes, so the formula should be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rcx). \n\nI need to make sure that the syntax is correct. The quantifier \u2203x is used, and the body is Nx (x is human) and Rcx (Hazel chased x).

The example given in the problem had a universal quantifier with an implication, but here it's existential with a conjunction.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is \"Every human is asleep just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\" Hmm, I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the main structure. The phrase \"just in case\" usually indicates a biconditional, right? So like, \"A just in case B\" translates to A \u2194 B. But wait, let me make sure. Sometimes \"just in case\" can be a bit tricky. Let me think. If the sentence says \"Every human is asleep just in case no donkeys chased Alfred,\" that sounds like the humans being asleep is equivalent to the condition that no donkeys chased Alfred. So, the entire statement is a biconditional between two parts: \"Every human is asleep\" and \"No donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n\nNow, let's formalize each part. \n\nFirst part: \"Every human is asleep.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"[1] is a human\" and J for \"[1] is asleep.\" So, using universal quantifier, it would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx). That's straightforward.\n\nSecond part: \"No donkeys chased Alfred.\" The abbreviations are M for \"[1] is a donkey,\" R for \"[1] chased [2],\" and a for Alfred. \"No donkeys chased Alfred\" means that there does not exist a donkey that chased Alfred. So, in logic terms, that's \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa). Alternatively, it could be written as \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acRxa), but both are equivalent. Since the first part uses a universal quantifier, maybe consistency isn't required here, but either form is correct. However, considering the biconditional, perhaps the existential form with negation is better here. Wait, but the first part is a universal statement. Let me check. The original sentence is \"Every human is asleep just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\" So the biconditional would be between \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) and \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula should be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa). But I need to make sure about the scope and the correct use of quantifiers. Let me double-check. The left side is \"Every human is asleep,\" which is a universal statement. The right side is \"No donkeys chased Alfred,\" which is the negation of an existential statement. So yes, the biconditional between those two would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, could the right side be expressed as \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acRxa)? Yes, because that's equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa). Either way is acceptable, but perhaps the problem expects one form over the other. Let me check standard practice. Typically, \"no X are Y\" is translated as \u00ac\u2203x (Xx \u2227 Yx), so in this case, \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa). So I think that's the right approach.\n\nTherefore, combining both parts with a biconditional, the formalization would be:\n\n\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa)\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible misinterpretation. The original sentence says \"Every human is asleep just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\" Another way to parse it might be that each human's being asleep depends on whether donkeys didn't chase Alfred. But \"just in case\" is typically a biconditional, not a conditional. So if no donkeys chased Alfred, then every human is asleep, and if every human is asleep, then no donkeys chased Alfred. That seems correct. \n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations. N is for human, J for asleep, M for donkey, R for chased, a for Alfred. All used correctly here. \n\nSo the final formula should be \u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Rxa). \n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct. Quantifiers and parentheses are properly placed. Also, in predicate logic, the standard syntax would have the quantifiers at the front of their respective formulas. Yes, that's how it's written here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the right side can be written with a universal quantifier. Let me think again. \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa) is equivalent to \u2200x \u00ac(Mx \u2227 Rxa), which is equivalent to \u2200x (\u00acMx \u2228 \u00acRxa), and that's equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acRxa). So both forms are correct, but perhaps the problem expects one. Since the example given in the problem uses existential quantifiers with negation (in the example, the translation was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), but here the second part is a negation of an existential. The example didn't involve a negation of an existential, but in standard translations, both forms are acceptable. However, since the problem didn't specify a preference, either should be okay. But maybe the most direct translation of \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Rxa). \n\nTherefore, I'll go with that. The final formula is \u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Rxa). \n\nLet me check once more for any possible errors. The use of abbreviations is correct. The biconditional is correctly placed between the two statements. Quantifiers are properly used. Yes, this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2194\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Rxa)",

The sentence is: \"If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into parts. The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. \n\nA is \"not all humans are asleep\". In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So \"not all\" is the negation of that, which is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this can be expressed as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx) because if not all are asleep, there's at least one human who isn't asleep. But maybe the original form is better here, depending on how the rest connects.\n\nThen the consequent is \"a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" The \"only if\" part is important. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, if a human chased Lewis (let's call that part P), then Q is Hazel kicked Alfred. \n\nSo the consequent is: If there exists a human who chased Lewis, then Hazel kicked Alfred. Wait, but the original says \"a human chased Lewis only if...\" So maybe it's structured as: For any human, if they chased Lewis, then Hazel kicked Alfred. Or is it about the existence? Let me think. The phrase \"a human chased Lewis\" is in the antecedent of the \"only if\". So \"If (a human chased Lewis), then (Hazel kicked Alfred)\". So that would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca. Wait, but \"only if\" usually connects two propositions. So the entire \"a human chased Lewis\" is the antecedent, and the \"Hazel kicked Alfred\" is the consequent. So the consequent of the main conditional is (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qca.\n\nPutting it all together, the whole statement is: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca]. \n\nBut let me check if I can simplify or rephrase parts. The main conditional is If (not all humans are asleep) then (if there's a human who chased Lewis, then Hazel kicked Alfred). \n\nAnother way to write \"not all humans are asleep\" is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). So maybe using that form would be better? But either form is logically equivalent. However, the problem says to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations are N for human, J for asleep, R for [1] chased [2], etc. So the translation should use those predicates correctly.\n\nSo the main formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca)\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can sometimes be rephrased. Also, remember that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But here, the structure is already as is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the consequent can be written as \u2200x((Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca). Because \"if a human chased Lewis...\" could be universalized. Let me think. Suppose there's a human who chased Lewis; then Hazel must have kicked Alfred. If we use a universal quantifier over x, then for every x, if x is a human and x chased Lewis, then Qca. That would be equivalent to saying that if any human chased Lewis, then Qca. Which is the same as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca. Because if there exists such an x, then the implication holds. However, in the universal form, if there are multiple humans who chased Lewis, it still requires Qca. So both forms are equivalent. Which one is better? The problem says to use the abbreviations given, but both are using the same predicates. However, perhaps the universal quantifier is more straightforward here. Let me check:\n\nOriginal consequent: \"a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" The \"a human\" here is existential, but the \"only if\" makes it so that the existence implies Qca. So \u2203x... \u2192 Qca. Alternatively, using the universal quantifier would be another way. Let me think about which is more accurate. \n\nIn logic, \"if there exists an x such that P(x), then Q\" is equivalent to \"for all x, P(x) \u2192 Q\", provided that Q doesn't mention x. Since Q here is Qca (Hazel kicked Alfred), which doesn't involve x, these two are equivalent. So both forms are acceptable. Which one should I use?\n\nThe example given in the problem uses \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So they used a universal quantifier for \"every\". In this case, the consequent is about \"a human chased Lewis only if...\", which is an implication where the antecedent is an existence. But depending on how you structure it, you can use either \u2203x... \u2192 Q or \u2200x(... \u2192 Q). Since the problem's example uses universal quantifiers for \"every\", perhaps using the universal form here would be more consistent. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the consequent would be \u2200x((Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca). Therefore, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 \u2200x((Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca)\n\nAlternatively, if I use the existential form:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca)\n\nBut which one is more correct? Let's think about the meaning. The original sentence says that if not all humans are asleep, then whenever a human chased Lewis, Hazel must have kicked Alfred. So it's saying that any occurrence of a human chasing Lewis requires Hazel kicking Alfred. So if even one human does that, then Q must be true. So the universal quantifier here would capture that: for any x, if x is a human and x chased Lewis, then Qca. Which is equivalent to saying that if there exists such an x, then Qca. So both are correct. But in predicate logic, which is preferable? The example uses universal quantifiers where possible, so perhaps using the universal here is better. However, the problem may accept either. But perhaps the original structure is better as an implication between two existentials. Wait, the main structure is a conditional where the antecedent is \"not all humans are asleep\" and the consequent is \"if a human chased Lewis, then Hazel kicked Alfred\". \n\nSo the consequent is a material implication where the antecedent is \"a human chased Lewis\" (which is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) and the consequent is Qca. Therefore, the correct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca). \n\nBut in predicate logic, implications with quantifiers can sometimes be rephrased. Also, note that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So the entire formula can also be written as (\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2227 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qca. However, the original structure is an implication where the consequent is another implication. So maybe the first form is better. \n\nBut let me check if there's a standard way. For \"only if\", the correct translation is usually P \u2192 Q. So if the sentence is \"P only if Q\", then it's P \u2192 Q. Here, P is \"a human chased Lewis\", which is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb). Therefore, the consequent is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca). \n\nBut I need to make sure that I'm using the abbreviations correctly. The abbreviations are N for \"[1] is a human\", J for \"[1] is asleep\", R for \"[1] chased [2]\", Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\", with the constants b (Lewis), c (Hazel), a (Alfred). \n\nSo yes, Rxb would mean x chased b (Lewis), and Qca is c (Hazel) kicked a (Alfred). \n\nNow, putting it all together. The main connective is the implication between the two parts. \n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca)\n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence between A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) and (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C, this could be written as (\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2227 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)) \u2192 Qca. But the problem says to return a single well-formed formula in standard syntax. Both are correct, but perhaps the first form is more direct. \n\nHowever, I need to check if the problem expects the use of certain quantifiers. For example, the example uses \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So in this case, the structure is similar. The example uses the universal quantifier for \"every\". \n\nBut in our case, the consequent is \"a human chased Lewis only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\" The \"only if\" part is an implication where the antecedent is an existential. So perhaps the correct way is to have the implication between the existential and Qca. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qca)\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the syntax is correct. The parentheses are properly placed. The quantifiers are correctly applied. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer should be that formula.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192Qca)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"Every monkey kicked Lewis and every human saw Alfred.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence into two parts: the part about monkeys kicking Lewis and the part about humans seeing Alfred. \n\nStarting with the first part: \"Every monkey kicked Lewis.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a monkey\" is O, and \"[1] kicked [2]\" is Q. Lewis is represented by b. So, for all x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x kicked Lewis (Qxb). That would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb).\n\nNow the second part: \"every human saw Alfred.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a human\" is N, and \"[1] saw [2]\" is P. Alfred is a. So similarly, for all y, if y is a human (Ny), then y saw Alfred (Pay). That would be \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pay). \n\nThe original sentence combines these two statements with \"and,\" so I need to conjoin the two universal statements. In predicate logic, the conjunction of two formulas is written with \u2227. Since both are universal quantifiers, I can either have two separate universal quantifiers or combine them if possible. However, since the variables x and y are different (but they can be the same variable if we structure it properly), but in this case, since the two parts are independent, it's acceptable to have two separate universal statements connected by \u2227. \n\nWait, but in formal logic, when you have two universal quantifiers, you can have them both at the beginning if they share the same scope. However, here the two parts are separate. So the correct way is to have \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Pay). \n\nAlternatively, since the variables x and y are bound variables, they can be reused. So maybe we can write \u2200x((Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 (Nx \u2192 Pax))? Wait, no, because the original sentence says \"every monkey\" and \"every human,\" which are two separate universal statements. So combining them into a single universal quantifier would imply that for every x, both (if x is a monkey then...) and (if x is a human then...). Which is actually equivalent. Because the original sentence is saying two separate universal statements connected by \"and.\" \n\nSo, actually, \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxa) would be correct. But since the variable name is arbitrary, we can use the same variable, say x, for both. Alternatively, we can write them as two separate quantifiers. Either way is acceptable. However, sometimes in logic, when you have two universal quantifiers separated by a conjunction, you can combine them into a single universal quantifier with the conjunction inside. \n\nSo, \u2200x [(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 (Nx \u2192 Pxa)] is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Pxa). Therefore, it's acceptable to write it as a single universal quantifier with the conjunction inside. \n\nBut wait, does that hold? Let me think. Suppose we have two separate universal statements: For all x, A(x) and for all x, B(x). This is equivalent to for all x, (A(x) \u2227 B(x)). Yes, that's a valid equivalence in predicate logic. So combining them into a single universal quantifier is correct here. \n\nTherefore, the entire formula can be written as \u2200x [(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 (Nx \u2192 Pxa)]. \n\nBut let me check if that's the case. Let's take an example. Suppose there's an x that is both a monkey and a human. Then, according to the combined formula, if x is a monkey, it must have kicked Lewis, and if it's a human, it must have seen Alfred. Which is exactly what the original sentence says. The original says every monkey (so all monkeys) did something, and every human did something else. So even if an entity is both, both conditions apply. So combining them with \u2227 inside the scope of a single \u2200x is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u2200x[(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 (Nx \u2192 Pxa)]. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write two separate universal quantifiers connected by \u2227, that would also be correct. However, the example given in the problem uses a single quantifier for each part. For instance, in the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So if the original sentence had two separate universals, perhaps the answer expects two separate quantifiers. Let me check the original problem's example again. \n\nThe example's sentence is \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" The formalization is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). Now, if the original problem had two separate statements, like \"Every linguist admires Charlie and every linguist is happy,\" then perhaps the correct formalization would be \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc) \u2227 \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Hx), or perhaps \u2200x[(Lx \u2192 Rxc) \u2227 (Lx \u2192 Hx)], which simplifies to \u2200x[Lx \u2192 (Rxc \u2227 Hx)]. \n\nBut in our current problem, the two universals are over different predicates: one is about monkeys, the other about humans. So combining them would require that for all x, if x is a monkey then... and if x is a human then... So the combined formula would be \u2200x[(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 (Nx \u2192 Pxa)]. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \u2200x[(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 (Nx \u2192 Pxa)]. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects two separate quantifiers, then it would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxa). But since variables are bound, and the two quantifiers are universal, combining them into one is acceptable and perhaps more concise. \n\nLooking back at the example provided, the user's example uses a single quantifier for one universal statement. Since the current problem has two universal statements connected by \"and,\" the correct approach is to represent the conjunction of two universal statements. However, since they can be merged into a single universal quantifier with a conjunction inside, that's acceptable. \n\nSo, I think the correct formalization is \u2200x[(Ox \u2192 Qxb) \u2227 (Nx \u2192 Pxa)].\n</think>\n\n\u2200x[(Ox\u2192Qxb) \u2227 (Nx\u2192Pxa)]",

The abbreviations are M for \"is a donkey\", N for \"is a human\", and P for \"[1] saw [2]\". \n\nFirst, the sentence starts with \"Every donkey\", so that should be a universal quantifier. So, for all x, if x is a donkey (Mx), then something happens. The something is \"saw a human\". \n\nNow, \"saw a human\" would be an existential quantifier. For each donkey, there exists some human that it saw. So, for each x where Mx is true, there exists a y such that Ny (y is a human) and Pxy (x saw y). \n\nPutting that together: \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Pxy)). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. The structure is \"Every A B a C\". So, for every A, there's a C such that B holds. Yes, so universal quantifier for A, then existential for C. And the predicate P is between the A and the C. So in this case, the donkey (x) saw (P) the human (y). So Pxy. \n\nSo the formula should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Pxy)). \n\nI need to make sure I'm using the abbreviations correctly. M is for donkey, N for human, P for saw. Yes.

So Pxy is correct. \n\nNo other connectives needed. The structure is implication from Mx to the existence of y. And for y, it has to satisfy both being a human and being seen by x.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to translate is \"Not all monkeys will run and Lewis is happy.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"is a monkey,\" F for \"will run,\" K for \"is happy,\" and b for Lewis. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"Not all monkeys will run,\" and the second part is \"Lewis is happy.\" The conjunction \"and\" connects these two parts, so the overall structure will be a conjunction of two formulas.\n\nStarting with \"Not all monkeys will run.\" In predicate logic, \"all monkeys will run\" would typically be expressed as \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx). But since the sentence says \"not all,\" I need to negate that universal quantifier. However, I remember that the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential quantifier with a negated inner statement. So \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00ac(Ox \u2192 Fx)). But Ox \u2192 Fx is equivalent to \u00acOx \u2228 Fx, so the negation would be Ox \u2227 \u00acFx. Therefore, \"Not all monkeys will run\" can be written as \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx). That makes sense because it means there exists at least one monkey that won't run.\n\nNext, \"Lewis is happy.\" Since Lewis is represented by the constant b, and K is the predicate for being happy, this part is straightforward: Kb.\n\nNow, combining these two parts with the conjunction \"and,\" the entire formula should be the conjunction of the two statements. So the final formula would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2227 Kb.\n\nWait, let me check if there's any possible mistake here. The original sentence is \"Not all monkeys will run and Lewis is happy.\" The \"and\" connects two independent statements, so yes, they should be separate conjuncts. Also, the existential quantifier is only for the first part, not affecting the second. So the structure is correct. \n\nAnother way to think about \"Not all\" is \"There exists at least one monkey that does not run,\" which is exactly what \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx) captures. And Lewis's happiness is a separate atomic proposition. So combining them with \u2227 is appropriate here.\n\nI don't see any other abbreviations or quantifiers needed. The use of the existential quantifier here is correct for negating the universal statement. Also, making sure that the scope of the negation is correctly applied over the entire universal quantification. \n\nTherefore, the formalization should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFxb) \u2227 Kb? Wait, no. Wait, the F is \"[1] will run,\" so Fx would be correct. Because F is a unary predicate (only one argument place), so Fx means x will run. So the correct part is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx). Then Kb for Lewis being happy. So the entire formula is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2227 Kb. \n\nYes, that seems right. Let me double-check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). Since R is \"[1] admires [2],\" so Rxc is \"x admires c.\" So similarly, Fx here is \"[x] will run,\" which is correct. \n\nSo the final answer should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2227 Kb.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2227 Kb",

The sentence to formalize is: \"Not all humans kicked Alfred if and only if a human is asleep.\" The abbreviations provided are N for \"is a human,\" Q for \"kicked,\" a for Alfred, and J for \"is asleep.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main connective here is \"if and only if,\" which translates to a biconditional (\u2194) in logic. So the entire statement is a biconditional between two parts: the left side is \"Not all humans kicked Alfred,\" and the right side is \"a human is asleep.\"\n\nStarting with the right side: \"a human is asleep.\" Since it's saying there exists at least one human who is asleep, that should be an existential quantifier. Using the abbreviation J for \"is asleep,\" it would be \u2203x(Jx \u2227 Nx). Wait, but the order here might matter. Actually, since we need to specify that the human is asleep, it's \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Jx). That makes sense because we're talking about the existence of a human who is asleep.\n\nNow the left side: \"Not all humans kicked Alfred.\" The phrase \"not all\" usually translates to the negation of a universal statement. The universal statement would be \"All humans kicked Alfred,\" which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxa). Therefore, negating that gives \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxa). Alternatively, using the equivalence between \u00ac\u2200 and \u2203\u00ac, this could also be written as \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acQxa). But which one is more appropriate here? The original sentence is \"Not all humans kicked Alfred,\" which is equivalent to saying there exists at least one human who did not kick Alfred. So either form is acceptable, but in formal logic, sometimes the existential form is preferred. However, since the problem doesn't specify, either would be correct. However, considering the example given in the instructions where \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), the negation would be \u00ac\u2200x(...). But maybe the problem expects the direct negation of the universal, so \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxa).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire biconditional would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxa) \u2194 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Jx). Wait, but let me check again. The sentence is \"Not all humans kicked Alfred if and only if a human is asleep.\" So the left side is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxa) and the right is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Jx). Therefore, the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxa) \u2194 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Jx).\n\nAlternatively, using the existential quantifier on the left side, it would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acQxa) \u2194 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Jx). Either way, both forms are logically equivalent. However, since the example uses the universal quantifier, perhaps the expected answer is using the negated universal. Let me confirm: \"Not all\" is typically the negation of \"all,\" so the first approach is more direct. Therefore, the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Qxa) \u2194 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Jx).\n\nI need to make sure that the abbreviations are correctly applied. N is for \"is a human,\" so Nx for x being human. Q is for \"kicked,\" so Qxa is x kicked Alfred (a). J is \"is asleep,\" so Jx is x is asleep. Yes, that all lines up. So the final formula should be the biconditional between the negated universal statement and the existential statement.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Qxa)\u2194\u2203x(Nx\u2227Jx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If Hazel is hungry, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are L for \"[1] is hungry\", c is Hazel, O for \"[1] is a monkey\", Q for \"[1] kicked [2]\", and b is Lewis.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If Hazel is hungry, then...\" So the antecedent is Hazel being hungry, which translates to Lc. The consequent is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nThe phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the structure is \"For every monkey, if they kicked Lewis, then no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" Wait, let me think again. The original statement is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So for each monkey, kicking Lewis can only happen if there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel. \n\nBreaking it down: For all x, if x is a monkey, then (Q(x, b) only if \u00ac\u2203y (O(y) \u2227 Q(y, c))). Wait, maybe not. Let me rephrase the consequent. The \"only if\" part applies to the entire \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" part. So maybe it's saying that if every monkey kicked Lewis, then there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel. But that doesn't fit with the original sentence structure. Wait, the original is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So the \"only if\" is connecting \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" with \"no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's structured as: If Hazel is hungry, then (for all monkeys, if they kicked Lewis, then there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel). Wait, that might be. Let me think again. The \"only if\" in \"A only if B\" means A \u2192 B. So if we have \"Every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel,\" that could be interpreted as: If every monkey kicked Lewis, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe for each monkey, if the monkey kicked Lewis, then there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel. That would be: For all x, if O(x) then (Q(x, b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (O(y) \u2227 Q(y, c))). \n\nBut the original sentence says \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if...\" So perhaps the entire universal statement is the antecedent of the \"only if.\" Hmm. Let's consider the structure. The main conditional is \"If Hazel is hungry, then [consequent].\" The consequent is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nAnother approach: Let's rephrase the consequent as \"If every monkey kicked Lewis, then no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" But does that capture the original meaning? The original says that every monkey's kicking Lewis happens only if there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel. So maybe the correct way is to have for all monkeys x, if x kicked Lewis, then there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel. That would mean that whenever a monkey kicks Lewis, then there's no monkey that kicked Hazel. So the formalization would be: For all x, (O(x) \u2192 (Q(x, b) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (O(y) \u2227 Q(y, c)))). \n\nBut then the original statement is about every monkey kicking Lewis, not each individual monkey. Wait, maybe the original is saying that the entire universal statement (every monkey kicked Lewis) is conditional on no monkeys having kicked Hazel. So it would be: (For all x (O(x) \u2192 Q(x, b))) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (O(y) \u2227 Q(y, c))). \n\nBut the wording is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" here is connecting the entire \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" to the \"no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" So the structure is \"A only if B\" where A is \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" and B is \"no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" Therefore, this translates to A \u2192 B. \n\nSo putting it all together, the consequent is (For all x (O(x) \u2192 Q(x, b))) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (O(y) \u2227 Q(y, c))). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula would be Lc \u2192 [ ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) ) ].\n\nBut wait, the original sentence says \"If Hazel is hungry, then [consequent].\" So the main connective is Lc \u2192 [ ... ]. \n\nBut let me check again. The original sentence: If Hazel is hungry, then (every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel). \n\nSo the consequent is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" As discussed, that's (For all x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is Lc \u2192 [ ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) ) ].\n\nBut is there a way to simplify this? Let's see. The consequent is a conditional statement where the antecedent is a universal statement and the consequent is a negated existential. \n\nAlternatively, could the consequent be expressed as \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))? That would be for each monkey x, if x kicked Lewis, then there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel. \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? Let's look at the original sentence again: \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" \n\nThe phrase \"only if\" here could be read in two ways. One possible reading is that the entire universal statement (every monkey kicked Lewis) is true only if the condition (no monkeys kicked Hazel) holds. So if every monkey did kick Lewis, then the condition must hold. This would correspond to the first interpretation: ( \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) ). \n\nAnother possible reading is that for each monkey, their kicking Lewis is conditional on the condition. So for each x, if x is a monkey, then (Qxb only if \u00ac\u2203y...). That would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y...)). \n\nWhich is the correct interpretation? The wording is a bit ambiguous. However, in English, \"every A only if B\" is often interpreted as \"for all A, if A then B\", but sometimes it's read as a universal conditional. \n\nBut let's think about the structure. The original is \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\" The \"only if\" is modifying the entire \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" part. So it's saying that the entire event (all monkeys kicking Lewis) can only happen if there's no monkeys that kicked Hazel. Therefore, if all monkeys did kick Lewis, then there must be no monkeys that kicked Hazel. \n\nBut another way to think about it is that each individual act of kicking Lewis by a monkey is conditional on there being no monkeys that kicked Hazel. So if any monkey kicked Lewis, then there are no monkeys that kicked Hazel. Which would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Qxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc) ). \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The original sentence's structure is a bit ambiguous, but in logical terms, \"only if\" typically applies to the entire antecedent. For example, \"John will come only if Mary comes\" is J \u2192 M. Similarly, \"Every A is B only if C\" would be (For all x, A(x) \u2192 B(x)) \u2192 C. But that's not standard. Wait, maybe not. Let's take an example: \"Every student passed only if the exam was easy.\" This would mean that if every student passed, then the exam was easy. So (For all x (Student(x) \u2192 Passed(x))) \u2192 Easy(exam). \n\nAlternatively, if it were \"Every student passed only if the exam was easy,\" another interpretation might be that each student's passing is conditional on the exam being easy. But in that case, it would be For all x (Student(x) \u2192 (Passed(x) \u2192 Easy(exam))). \n\nSo which is correct? The first interpretation would be that the entire universal passing is conditional on the exam being easy. The second interpretation is that each individual passing is conditional on the exam being easy. \n\nIn logic, the \"only if\" in such a case is usually taken to apply to each individual case. For example, \"Every student passed only if they studied\" would mean that for each student, if they passed, then they studied. So For all x (Student(x) \u2192 (Passed(x) \u2192 Studied(x))). \n\nTherefore, applying that to our original problem, \"every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" would be interpreted as for each monkey, if they kicked Lewis, then no monkeys kicked Hazel. So \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc))).\n\nSo putting it all together, the main formula is Lc \u2192 [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))]. \n\nNow, let's formalize this. \n\nFirst, Lc is \"Hazel is hungry\". \n\nThen, for all x, if Ox (x is a monkey), then (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)). \n\nSo the entire formula is Lc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc))). \n\nAlternatively, we can push the quantifiers and simplify. Let me check the order. \n\nThe inner part is Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc). This is equivalent to Qxb \u2192 \u2200y (\u00ac(Oy \u2227 Qyc)), which is Qxb \u2192 \u2200y (\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acQyc). But maybe it's better to leave it as is. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\nLc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))\n\nNow, let's check if this is well-formed. \n\nYes. The quantifiers are properly placed. The variables are correctly used. \n\nSo translating this into symbols:\n\nLc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))\n\nWhich can also be written as:\n\nLc \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Qxb \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Oy \u2227 Qyc)))\n\nYes, that's the correct formalization according to the interpretation where each monkey's kicking Lewis is conditional on no monkeys having kicked Hazel. \n\nAlternatively, if the other interpretation were correct, the formula would be different, but based on standard logical translations, the per-individual interpretation seems more accurate. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be this formula.\n</think>\n\nLc\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Qxb\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(Oy\u2227Qyc)))",

The sentence is \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless Alfred isn't a human.\" The abbreviations given are O for [1] is a monkey, Q for [1] kicked [2], c is Hazel, N for [1] is a human, and a is Alfred. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main structure here is \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless Alfred isn't a human.\" The word \"unless\" often translates into a logical statement involving a disjunction or a conditional. In logic, \"A unless B\" can be translated as \"A \u2228 B\" or equivalently \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Let me recall: \"unless\" usually means that if B is not the case, then A must be true. So \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\".\n\nIn this case, A is \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" and B is \"Alfred isn't a human\". Wait, the original sentence says \"unless Alfred isn't a human\". So B here is \"Alfred isn't a human\", which is \u00acN(a). So the structure would be \"A \u2228 \u00acN(a)\" or \"\u00ac(\u00acN(a)) \u2192 A\". But simplifying, \u00ac(\u00acN(a)) is N(a), so the implication becomes N(a) \u2192 A.\n\nBut let's confirm. The original sentence: \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless Alfred isn't a human.\" So if Alfred is a human (i.e., \u00acB, since B is \"Alfred isn't a human\"), then A (monkey kicked Hazel) must be true. So the implication is N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (O(x) \u2227 Q(x, c)). Because \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" would mean there exists some x that is a monkey (O(x)) and x kicked Hazel (Q(x, c)).\n\nAlternatively, using the \"unless\" as A \u2228 B, where A is \"there exists a monkey who kicked Hazel\" and B is \"Alfred isn't a human\". So the entire statement would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc) \u2228 \u00acN(a). However, in formal logic, sometimes the implication is preferred. Let me think which is more appropriate here.\n\nThe original sentence can be phrased as \"If Alfred is a human, then a monkey kicked Hazel.\" Because the \"unless\" introduces a condition where if the condition isn't met (Alfred isn't a human), then the main statement doesn't have to hold. So the implication would be N(a) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). \n\nSo the correct formalization would be N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)). Let me check the abbreviations again. O is [1] is a monkey, so Ox means x is a monkey. Q is [1] kicked [2], so Q(x, c) is x kicked Hazel (since c is Hazel). N is [1] is a human, so N(a) is Alfred is a human. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together: The sentence is saying that if Alfred is a human, then there exists a monkey who kicked Hazel. That translates to N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc). \n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the disjunction form, it would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc) \u2228 \u00acN(a). Both forms are logically equivalent because A unless B is equivalent to A \u2228 B, where B is \"Alfred isn't a human\" (\u00acN(a)), so the disjunction is between \u2203x... and \u00acN(a). However, depending on the convention, sometimes implications are preferred. \n\nBut the example given in the problem uses implication. For instance, the example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So in that case, they used implication for the universal quantifier. In our case, since we have an existential quantifier, perhaps using implication is still appropriate here. Let me check the equivalence again. \n\n\"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"if not B, then A\". So \u00acB \u2192 A. In our case, B is \"Alfred isn't a human\", so \u00acB is \"Alfred is a human\", which is N(a). And A is \"A monkey kicked Hazel\", which is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). Therefore, the correct formalization is N(a) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Qxc). \n\nSo the final formula should be N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Q(x, c)). \n\nLet me double-check for any possible mistakes. The sentence says \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless Alfred isn't a human.\" So if Alfred is not a human (i.e., \u00acN(a)), then the \"unless\" condition is met, so the main clause doesn't have to be true. But if Alfred is a human, then the main clause must be true. Therefore, the implication is correct. \n\nYes, I think that's right. So the answer is N(a) \u2192 \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Qxc).\n</think>\n\nN(a)\u2192\u2203x(Ox\u2227Qxc)",

The sentence is: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel is hungry only if a human chased Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. So the overall form will be A \u2192 B.\n\nStarting with the antecedent, \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So \"not all humans are asleep\" is the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), but maybe the problem expects the direct negation. Wait, the instructions say to use the given abbreviations and standard syntax. So probably \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) is acceptable.\n\nNow the consequent: \"Hazel is hungry only if a human chased Hazel.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So if Hazel is hungry (Lc), then there exists a human who chased Hazel (Rx,c where Nx). Wait, the subject of \"chased\" is the human, so R is [1] chased [2], so Rxy means x chased y. So Hazel is c, so the consequent would be Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc)). \n\nBut let me check if I got the \"only if\" right. The original says \"Hazel is hungry only if a human chased Hazel.\" So \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So Hazel's being hungry (Lc) can only happen if there's a human who chased her. So yes, Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). \n\nSo the whole formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc)). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the consequent as Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). \n\nSo combining these, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nBut I need to make sure that the structure is correct. Let me check again. The main connective is the implication from the antecedent to the consequent. The antecedent is \"not all humans are asleep\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). The consequent is \"Hazel is hungry only if...\", which is Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula should be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxc))\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify or rearrange, but I think that's the correct structure. Let me make sure there are no parentheses issues. The antecedent is a negation of a universal, and the consequent is an implication. So the whole thing is a material implication connecting those two parts. Yes. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(Lc\u2192\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The sentence is: \"A donkey kicked Hazel only if Lewis doesn't see Lewis.\" Hmm, first I need to parse the sentence correctly. The main structure here seems to be a conditional. The phrase \"only if\" usually translates to an implication where the condition is necessary for the outcome. So, if A only if B, that's A \u2192 B. \n\nSo, breaking down the sentence: The antecedent is \"A donkey kicked Hazel,\" and the consequent is \"Lewis doesn't see Lewis.\" Wait, but \"see Lewis\" would be Lewis seeing himself? Because the second part is \"Lewis doesn't see Lewis.\" So, using the abbreviations given.\n\nAbbreviations: M is [1] is a donkey, Q is [1] kicked [2], c is Hazel, P is [1] saw [2], b is Lewis. \n\nFirst, \"A donkey kicked Hazel.\" So, there exists a donkey (so \u2203x Mx) who kicked Hazel. But since the subject is a donkey, we need to quantify over x. So, the existence of an x such that Mx (x is a donkey) and Qx c (x kicked Hazel). So that part is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qx c).\n\nThen the \"only if\" part: Lewis doesn't see Lewis. Lewis is b, so \"Lewis doesn't see Lewis\" is \u00acPb b. Because P is [1] saw [2], so Pb b would be Lewis saw Lewis, and the negation of that.\n\nPutting it together with the implication. The entire statement is: If there exists a donkey that kicked Hazel, then Lewis doesn't see Lewis. So the formalization would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qx c) \u2192 \u00acPb b. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The original sentence is \"A donkey kicked Hazel only if Lewis doesn't see Lewis.\" So \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So the kicking happens only if the condition is met. So, the kicking is the antecedent, and the condition is the consequent. So yes, \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxc) \u2192 \u00acPb b. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not mixing up the direction. In logic, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. For example, \"I will go only if it is sunny\" translates to Go \u2192 Sunny. So yes, the kicking (A) only happens if the condition (B) is true. So the formula is correct.\n\nNow check if the abbreviations are used correctly. M for donkey, Q for kicked with two arguments, c is Hazel. So Qx c is correct. P is saw, so Pb b is Lewis saw Lewis. The negation is \u00acPb b. \n\nSo the final formula should be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 Qxc) \u2192 \u00acPbb. \n\nWait, the variables: x is the donkey, so the quantifier is \u2203x. And since there's no other quantifiers in the consequent, it's all good. \n\nYes, I think that's right. Let me write it properly with the symbols. The arrow is \u2192, and the quantifier is \u2203x. So the formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Qxc) \u2192 \u00acPbb\n\nThat should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Mx\u2227Qxc)\u2192\u00acPbb",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully. \n\nFirst, the main structure is a conditional statement: \"If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" Let's parse each part.\n\nThe first part of the conditional is \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So \"not all\" would be the negation of that: \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, using the quantifier negation rule, this is equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx). But maybe I should stick with the negation as given unless the problem specifies otherwise. The original instruction says to use the given abbreviations, but here I have to use standard logic symbols, so I think it's okay to write \u00ac\u2200x(...).\n\nThe second part is the then-clause: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is the A part, and \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is B. So the structure is (\u00acPab) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc)). Wait, let me confirm. The \"only if\" is between the two parts. So the statement is: If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Hazel. So the implication is \u00acPab \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc). Alternatively, maybe I should rephrase the \"only if\" part. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" So this is equivalent to: If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then it's the case that not all donkeys saw Hazel. So yes, the implication is from \u00acPab to \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc). \n\nBut another way to look at \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is \u2203y(My \u2227 \u00acPyc). But again, the problem doesn't specify to convert the negation into existential form, so I should probably leave it as \u00ac\u2200y(...).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx), then (\u00acPab \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc)). So the formalization would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc))\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's a way to simplify or structure it differently. Let me make sure I'm not missing any parts. The main connective is the implication of the entire if-then. The antecedent is \"not all humans are asleep,\" and the consequent is the \"only if\" statement. \n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations are N for human, J for asleep, P for [1] saw [2], a for Alfred, b for Lewis, M for donkey, c for Hazel. So all the terms are correctly used here. \n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc))\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check the \"only if\" part again. The statement \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" (\u00acPab) and B is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc)). So yes, the implication is \u00acPab \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(...). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is a conditional where the antecedent is the negation of \"all humans are asleep,\" and the consequent is another conditional between \u00acPab and the negation of \"all donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00acPab\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Pyc))",

So, for all x, if x is a monkey (Ox), then x drank (Hx). That would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Hx).\n\nNext, \"Hazel isn't asleep.\" Since Hazel is represented by constant c, and J is \"is asleep,\" this part would be \u00acJc. The negation here is important because it's stating that Hazel is not asleep.\n\nNow, combining both parts with a conjunction (\u2227) because the original sentence uses \"and.\" So the entire formula should be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Hx) \u2227 \u00acJc.\n\nI need to make sure that the quantifier applies only to the first part and that the conjunction is correctly placed.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem. The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. The sentence is: \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the structure. The main conditional is \"If A, then B.\" So A is \"every monkey chased Hazel,\" and B is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" Let's handle each part separately.\n\nStarting with A: \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and R is \"[1] chased [2].\" Hazel is represented by c. So \"every monkey chased Hazel\" would translate to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow the consequent B: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So here, the statement is saying that Alfred didn't kick Hazel (\u00acQ) only if no donkeys ate (\u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix)). Wait, let me think again. The original is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" Let me rephrase it: If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no donkeys ate. Wait, no. Wait, \"P only if Q\" is equivalent to P \u2192 Q. So if P is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" and Q is \"no donkeys ate,\" then it's \u00acQa c \u2192 ...? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if [no donkeys ate].\" So \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" is the P, and \"no donkeys ate\" is Q. So the translation would be P \u2192 Q. But P is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel,\" which is \u00acQ(a, c), since Q is \"[1] kicked [2].\" So Alfred is 'a', Hazel is 'c', so Qac would be \"Alfred kicked Hazel.\" So \u00acQac is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" Then Q (in the P \u2192 Q structure) is \"no donkeys ate,\" which is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). So putting it together: \u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Alternatively, maybe I can write that as \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx), but both are equivalent. However, the standard form for \"no donkeys ate\" is \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix), so that's probably better.\n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" So the \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So the statement is that for Alfred not to have kicked Hazel, it's necessary that no donkeys ate. So that would be: If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no donkeys ate. So indeed \u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Alternatively, since \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx), but the former is more direct here.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: If [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc)], then [\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix)]. So in logical terms, that's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix)).\n\nBut I should check if there's any other way to interpret the original sentence. Let me re-read it: \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\" The \"only if\" is in the consequent of the main conditional. So the entire structure is: A \u2192 (B only if C), which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's how I translated it.\n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations. Let's verify each symbol:\n\n- O: [1] is a monkey. Correct for \"every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n- R: [1] chased [2]. So Rxc is \"x chased c (Hazel).\" Correct.\n- c: Hazel. Correct.\n- Q: [1] kicked [2]. So Qac is \"Alfred kicked Hazel.\" Correct.\n- a: Alfred. Correct.\n- M: [1] is a donkey. Correct.\n- I: [1] ate. So Mx \u2227 Ix would be \"x is a donkey and x ate.\" So \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) is \"no donkeys ate.\" Correct.\n\nSo the entire formula should be:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes it's better to simplify the implications. Let me see if there's a way to write this without the nested implication. Alternatively, since A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to return the formula in standard syntax, so either form is acceptable. However, the example uses a straightforward implication. Let me check if there's any mistake in the structure.\n\nWait, the original sentence is \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then [Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if no donkeys ate].\" So the main connective is the implication between the two parts. The consequent is the \"only if\" statement. So the correct translation is as written.\n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nAlternatively, to make it more explicit, maybe we can write the inner implication as \u00acQac \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx), but since \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix) is equivalent to \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx), both are correct. However, using the abbreviation, the direct translation of \"no donkeys ate\" would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix), so that's probably better to stick with that.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any parentheses missing? Let's structure it properly. The main implication is between the antecedent \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) and the consequent (\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix)). So the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00acQac \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nYes, that's correct. The parentheses are necessary to group the consequent properly.\n\nSo I think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxc)\u2192(\u00acQac\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Ix))",

The main conditional is \"If not all humans are asleep, then [Alfred ate only if every human is asleep].\" Let's break it down.\n\nThe antecedent is \"not all humans are asleep.\" In predicate logic, \"all humans are asleep\" would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So \"not all humans are asleep\" is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203x(Nx \u2227 \u00acJx), but maybe the original form is better here since the sentence uses \"not all.\"\n\nThe consequent is \"Alfred ate only if every human is asleep.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. So here, Alfred ate (Ia) only if every human is asleep (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx)). So that part would be Ia \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is a conditional: If [\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx)], then [Ia \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx)].

The consequent is Ia \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). The antecedent is \u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx). So the implication is that if the antecedent is true (i.e., not all humans are asleep), then whenever Alfred ate, it must be that all humans are asleep. But that seems contradictory because if not all are asleep, then the consequent requires that if Alfred ate, then all are asleep. Which would mean that if not all are asleep, Alfred couldn't have eaten. So maybe the whole thing is a way to say that Alfred only ate when all humans are asleep. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire statement is a way of expressing that Alfred's eating depends on all humans being asleep. The original sentence is a bit complex, but I think the translation as a conditional with the antecedent being the negation of \"all humans asleep\" and the consequent being the implication of Alfred's eating leading to all humans being asleep is correct.\n\nSo the final formula would be:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (Ia \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Jx))\n\nAlternatively, using the abbreviations as given. Let me check if I used all the abbreviations correctly. N is for human, J for asleep, I for ate, a for Alfred. Yes. So that's correct. I don't see any other abbreviations needed here.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation problem. The sentence is \"If Hazel ate, then not all donkeys are hungry.\" The abbreviations given are I for \"[1] ate\", c for Hazel, M for \"[1] is a donkey\", and L for \"[1] is hungry\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If Hazel ate, then... So the antecedent is \"Hazel ate\", which should be translated using the abbreviation I with c as the argument. That would be Ic.\n\nThe consequent is \"not all donkeys are hungry\". In predicate logic, \"all donkeys are hungry\" would typically be expressed as \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). But since we have \"not all\", we need to negate that universal quantifier. The negation of \"all\" is \"there exists at least one that is not\". So, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). Alternatively, using the rules of quantifier negation, this can be rewritten as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). But the problem says to use the standard syntax, so maybe keeping it as \u00ac\u2200x(...) is acceptable unless there's a specific requirement to convert it. However, sometimes in formal logic, it's preferable to push the negation inside if possible. Let me think. \n\nThe original statement is \"not all donkeys are hungry\". Another way to phrase that is \"there exists a donkey that is not hungry\". So \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). But the question is whether to present it as the negation of the universal or as the existential. Since the original sentence is a conditional leading to the negation of a universal, perhaps it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx) for accuracy. But both forms are equivalent via the rules of quantifier negation. However, since the problem doesn't specify any preference, I need to check if there's any reason to prefer one over the other. \n\nIn the example provided, they used the universal quantifier with implication for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So following that example, \"all donkeys are hungry\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). Therefore, \"not all donkeys are hungry\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire conditional would be Ic \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut wait, let me make sure there's no other way. Let me think again. The sentence is \"If Hazel ate, then not all donkeys are hungry.\" So the structure is: If Ic, then \u00ac(all donkeys are hungry). Since \"all donkeys are hungry\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx), then the negation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence between \u00ac\u2200x(P \u2192 Q) and \u2203x(P \u2227 \u00acQ), which would make it \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). But since the original is a conditional leading to the negation of the universal, perhaps the correct form is to keep it as the negated universal. However, in formal logic, both expressions are equivalent. But the problem might expect the form that directly negates the universal statement as in the example. \n\nLooking back at the example: \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). If the sentence had been \"Not every linguist admires Charlie,\" it would be \u00ac\u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), which is equivalent to \u2203x(Lx \u2227 \u00acRxc). But the example uses the universal form. So following that pattern, the answer here would be Ic \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut maybe the problem expects the existential form. Let me check. The user instructions don't specify, so either form is logically correct, but perhaps the expected answer is using the negated universal. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the existential. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"not all donkeys are hungry,\" which is equivalent to \"some donkey is not hungry,\" which is the existential. However, in formal logic, sometimes people prefer to have the negation outside the quantifier unless required otherwise. But since the example uses the universal, perhaps the answer here should follow the same structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the existential. Let me check the example again. The example's formalization uses the universal. The original sentence is a conditional where the consequent is the negation of a universal. So the formalization would be Ic \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut I should also check if there's any other aspect. The abbreviations are given as M: [1] is a donkey, L: [1] is hungry. So the universal statement is \"for all x, if x is a donkey, then x is hungry.\" So the negation of that is \"it is not the case that for all x, if x is a donkey, then x is hungry.\" Therefore, the correct formalization of the consequent is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula is Ic \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to write it with the existential, it would be Ic \u2192 \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). But which one is expected? Since the example uses the universal, and the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, both are correct, but maybe the answer is expected to use the negated universal. However, in many logic courses, converting the negation into the quantifier is preferred. For example, \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP. But in this case, P is (Mx \u2192 Lx), so \u00ac(Mx \u2192 Lx) is equivalent to Mx \u2227 \u00acLx. Therefore, \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Lx) is equivalent to \u2203x \u00ac(Mx \u2192 Lx), which is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acLx). \n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula in standard predicate logic syntax. There's no instruction to push the negation through, so either form is acceptable. However, in the example, they used the universal form. The example's consequent was \"admires Charlie,\" which was expressed as Rxc in the implication. So following that, the answer would be Ic \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut maybe the problem expects the existential. Let me check the example again. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc), which directly mirrors \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So the negation of a universal would be the existential of the negation. However, the problem here is about the consequent of a conditional. The user's instruction is to translate the sentence as is. Since the sentence says \"not all donkeys are hungry,\" which is the negation of a universal statement, the direct translation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is Ic \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nBut let me make sure that there isn't a scope issue. The antecedent is \"Hazel ate,\" which is Ic. The consequent is \"not all donkeys are hungry,\" which is the negation of the universal. So the entire formula is Ic \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Lx). \n\nYes, that seems correct. I think that's the right approach here.\n</think>\n\nIc\u2192\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Lx)",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is: \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis unless a monkey is hungry.\" The abbreviations given are M for donkey, Q for kicked, b for Lewis, O for monkey, and L for hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The structure is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis unless a monkey is hungry.\" The phrase \"unless\" usually translates to a logical implication where the condition is the negation of the 'unless' clause. So \"A unless B\" is typically equivalent to \"If not B, then A.\" But here, the main clause is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" and the 'unless' part is \"a monkey is hungry.\"\n\nSo, breaking it down: \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" is the same as saying \"It is not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"All donkeys kicked Lewis\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). So the negation would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). However, sometimes it's preferable to use the existential quantifier with negation. Remember that \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP. So that would become \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). But I need to check if that's the correct interpretation here.\n\nNow the 'unless' part: \"unless a monkey is hungry.\" So the entire statement is: If it's not the case that a monkey is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Lewis. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis unless a monkey is hungry.\" Which would translate to: If a monkey is not hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Lewis. Alternatively, the \"unless\" can be phrased as \"All donkeys kicked Lewis only if a monkey is hungry.\" Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: The original sentence can be rephrased as \"If no monkey is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Or maybe \"If a monkey is hungry, then all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Wait, no. Let me think again. The standard translation for \"A unless B\" is \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" So here, A is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" and B is \"a monkey is hungry.\" Therefore, the translation would be \u00acLm \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb), but wait, the monkey being hungry is Lm? Wait, the abbreviations are O: [1] is a monkey, and L: [1] is hungry. So \"a monkey is hungry\" would be \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). Wait, but the original sentence says \"a monkey is hungry,\" which is an existential statement. So the 'unless' clause is \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). Therefore, the entire structure is \u00ac(\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). But maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, using the material implication.\n\nAlternatively, the entire statement is equivalent to: All donkeys kicked Lewis only if a monkey is hungry. Which would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). Because \"only if\" introduces the necessary condition. So if all donkeys kicked Lewis, then there must be a hungry monkey. That might be another way to represent it.\n\nBut the original sentence is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis unless a monkey is hungry.\" Which can be rephrased as \"If a monkey is not hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" So the antecedent is \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly), which is equivalent to \u2200y(\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acLy), but that's more complex. So translating \"unless B, A\" as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\", where A is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" and B is \"a monkey is hungry.\" So \u00acB is \"No monkey is hungry,\" which is \u2200y(\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acLy), but perhaps more simply written as \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). So the implication would be \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nBut let's see if we can simplify this. The contrapositive of that implication would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly), which is the same as the \"only if\" version. So both are equivalent.\n\nNow, the problem is to formalize this using the given abbreviations. Let's check the abbreviations again:\n\nM: [1] is a donkey\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2]\n\nb: Lewis\n\nO: [1] is a monkey\n\nL: [1] is hungry\n\nSo, the statement \"a monkey is hungry\" would be \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). The negation of that is \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly), which is equivalent to \u2200y(\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acLy), but perhaps we can just keep it as \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) for the antecedent.\n\nThe consequent is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). Alternatively, \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQxb). Either form is acceptable, but maybe the problem expects the negated universal.\n\nSo the implication would be \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). However, in predicate logic, it's often preferable to push the negation inwards. Let's see:\n\n\u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) is equivalent to \u2200y\u00ac(Oy \u2227 Ly), which is \u2200y(\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acLy). But maybe we can leave it as \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) for simplicity.\n\nPutting it all together: The entire formula would be \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). However, another equivalent form is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). Which one is correct? The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis unless a monkey is hungry,\" which is equivalent to \"If a monkey is not hungry, then it's not the case that all donkeys kicked Lewis,\" which is the same as the first form. But the contrapositive is \"If all donkeys kicked Lewis, then a monkey is hungry,\" which is the second form. Either is logically equivalent. However, the problem is to formalize the given sentence directly. Let's check which one is more direct.\n\nThe original sentence structure is \"Not A unless B,\" which is \"\u00acA \u2192 B\" or \"B \u2228 \u00acA\"? Wait, no. Let me recall: \"A unless B\" is usually translated as \"A \u2228 B\", but sometimes as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". Let me think. For example, \"I will go unless it rains\" can be read as \"I will go or it rains,\" or as \"If it does not rain, then I will go.\" These are logically equivalent. So \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\", which is also equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\".\n\nSo in this case, \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis unless a monkey is hungry.\" Let A be \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis\" and B be \"a monkey is hungry.\" Then the translation would be A \u2228 B, which is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 A. So the formula would be \u00acB \u2192 A, where B is \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly), and A is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). Therefore, the formula is \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). Alternatively, using the contrapositive, which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). Both are equivalent.\n\nBut which one is the correct formalization according to the problem's requirements? The problem says to use the abbreviations given. The user example uses \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) for \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" So they prefer using universal quantifiers where possible. However, in this case, the correct translation could be either form. Let me check the example again. The example's sentence was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which is straightforward. The current problem is more complex.\n\nThe problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both forms are acceptable, but perhaps the expected answer is the contrapositive form. Let me think again. The original sentence: \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis unless a monkey is hungry.\" Let's rephrase it as \"If a monkey is not hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Which is the same as the first form. Alternatively, \"All donkeys kicked Lewis only if a monkey is hungry.\" Which is the contrapositive. Both are correct.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the contrapositive form. Let me check the structure. The contrapositive form is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). But how to write that in predicate logic. The antecedent is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb), and the consequent is \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). So the formula is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). \n\nAlternatively, the original form is \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). Which is equivalent. But perhaps the problem expects the contrapositive form. Let me think which is more direct. The original sentence is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis unless a monkey is hungry.\" So the \"unless\" is acting as a condition for the negation. So the contrapositive form might be more straightforward.\n\nBut to be sure, let's think of the logical equivalence. The two statements are logically equivalent, so either is acceptable. However, the problem might prefer one form over the other. Since the example uses a universal quantifier, perhaps the contrapositive form is better here. Let's try that.\n\nSo the formula would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). However, in predicate logic, implications with quantifiers need to be handled carefully. The antecedent is a universal statement, and the consequent is an existential one. So the formula is a conditional where the antecedent is universal and the consequent is existential. That's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, the other form is \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). Which is also acceptable. Which one is better? Let's think about how to express \"unless\" in logic. As mentioned earlier, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". In this case, A is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis\", which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb), and B is \"a monkey is hungry\", which is \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). Therefore, the correct translation is \u00acB \u2192 A, which is \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nBut another way to look at it is that the original sentence can be rephrased as \"If there is no hungry monkey, then not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Which is exactly the \u00acB \u2192 A form. So that's the correct translation.\n\nTherefore, the formula is \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). \n\nBut maybe we can write this with the negation distributed. The antecedent \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) is equivalent to \u2200y\u00ac(Oy \u2227 Ly), which is \u2200y(\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acLy). But perhaps the problem expects the existential quantifier in the consequent. Alternatively, we can leave it as is.\n\nSo the final formula would be \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). However, in predicate logic, it's common to avoid leading negation symbols on quantifiers. So perhaps converting it to \u2200y(\u00acOy \u2228 \u00acLy) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb). But that's more complicated. Alternatively, the original form is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, using the contrapositive, which is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). This might be simpler and perhaps more in line with the example's style. Let me check again. The example used a universal quantifier with an implication. The contrapositive form here uses a universal antecedent and an existential consequent. \n\nBut which is the correct way to formalize the original sentence? Let me test with some examples. Suppose there's a monkey that is hungry. Then the consequent is true, so the implication holds. If there's no hungry monkey, then the antecedent of the contrapositive (forall x (Mx \u2192 Qxb)) would require that all donkeys kicked Lewis. But the original sentence says that if there's no hungry monkey, then not all donkeys kicked Lewis. Therefore, the contrapositive form \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly) is correct because if all donkeys did kick Lewis, then there must be a hungry monkey. That matches the original sentence's meaning.\n\nSo the contrapositive form is correct. Therefore, the formula is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly). \n\nBut wait, the original sentence is \"Not all donkeys kicked Lewis unless a monkey is hungry.\" Which is equivalent to \"If a monkey is not hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Lewis.\" Which is equivalent to \"If all donkeys kicked Lewis, then a monkey is hungry.\" So yes, the contrapositive is correct. Therefore, the formula is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly).\n\nSo now, using the given abbreviations:\n\n- Mx: x is a donkey\n\n- Qxb: x kicked b (Lewis)\n\n- Oy: y is a monkey\n\n- Ly: y is hungry\n\nSo the formula is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly).\n\nThis seems to fit. Let me check if there are any issues. The original sentence is about the condition that unless there's a hungry monkey, not all donkeys kicked Lewis. The contrapositive version says that if all donkeys did kick Lewis, then there must be a hungry monkey. That's logically equivalent and captures the intended meaning.\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxb) \u2192 \u2203y(Oy \u2227 Ly).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxb)\u2192\u2203y(Oy\u2227Ly)",

The sentence to formalize is: \"A monkey saw Alfred only if not all humans chased Lewis.\" The abbreviations given are O for being a monkey, P for seeing, a for Alfred, N for being a human, R for chasing, and b for Lewis.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The phrase \"only if\" usually introduces a necessary condition. So, the structure is something like \"If A, then B\", where B is the necessary condition. But \"only if\" can sometimes be tricky. Let me recall that \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So in this case, the statement is saying that if a monkey saw Alfred, then it's not the case that all humans chased Lewis. \n\nNow, breaking it down. The main implication is: (There exists a monkey that saw Alfred) \u2192 (It is not true that all humans chased Lewis). Wait, but the original sentence says \"A monkey saw Alfred...\" which could be interpreted as there exists a monkey who saw Alfred. So the antecedent is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Pxa), right? Because there's some x that is a monkey (Ox) and x saw Alfred (Pxa).\n\nThe consequent is \"not all humans chased Lewis\". The negation of \"all humans chased Lewis\" would be \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Ryb). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u00acRyb). But in formal logic, it's often preferable to keep the negation outside the quantifier unless necessary. However, the original statement is \"not all...\", so the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Ryb). \n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Pxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Ryb). \n\nWait, but let me check if I got the \"only if\" direction right. The original sentence is \"A monkey saw Alfred only if not all humans chased Lewis.\" So the \"only if\" means that the existence of the monkey seeing Alfred can only happen if the condition about humans and Lewis holds. So the structure is indeed: if there's a monkey that saw Alfred, then the condition about not all humans chasing Lewis must be true. So the implication is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations. O is for monkey, P is for saw, a is Alfred. For the humans, N is [1] is a human, R is [1] chased [2], and b is Lewis. So the formalization should correctly use these. \n\nSo the antecedent is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Pxa), and the consequent is \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Ryb). Therefore, the entire formula is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Pxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Ryb). \n\nAlternatively, the consequent could be written as \u2203y (Ny \u2227 \u00acRyb), but since the original sentence says \"not all\", it's more direct to use the negation of the universal quantifier. However, both forms are equivalent. But since the problem asks for formalization using the given abbreviations, I think either form is acceptable. However, the standard way to express \"not all\" is \u00ac\u2200... So I'll stick with that.\n\nTherefore, the final formula is \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Pxa) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (Ny \u2192 Ryb).\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox\u2227Pxa)\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(Ny\u2192Ryb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is \"Not all monkeys will run and every human is happy.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence into two parts. The first part is \"Not all monkeys will run,\" and the second part is \"every human is happy.\" I'll handle each part separately and then combine them with the appropriate logical connective.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all monkeys will run.\" In predicate logic, \"all A are B\" is usually expressed as \u2200x(Ax \u2192 Bx). So, \"all monkeys will run\" would be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx). But the sentence says \"not all,\" which is the negation of that. So, \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx). Alternatively, I remember that \"not all\" can be equivalent to \"there exists at least one that doesn't.\" So, \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx). Wait, which one is correct? Let me think. The negation of \u2200x(P \u2192 Q) is \u2203x(P \u2227 \u00acQ). Yes, that's right. So both expressions are equivalent. So for \"Not all monkeys will run,\" I can write either \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) or \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx). Which one should I use? The problem says to use standard syntax, and since the example used the universal quantifier with implication, maybe it's better to stick with the negation of the universal. But both are correct. However, sometimes in formal logic, using the negation of a universal is acceptable. Let me check. The original sentence is \"Not all...\", so directly translating that would be the negation of the universal statement. So \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx).\n\nNow the second part: \"every human is happy.\" Using the same structure as the example, this would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Kx). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, combining the two parts with \"and.\" The original sentence uses \"and,\" so in logic, that's the conjunction \u2227. So the entire formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Kx). \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the variables are properly bound. In the first part, the existential would have its own x, but since in the first part I'm using the negation of the universal, maybe there's no conflict. However, if I had used \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx), then combining with \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Ky) would be okay because the variables are different. But if both use x, then technically, the x in the existential and the x in the universal are separate. But in predicate logic, when you have multiple quantifiers, you can reuse variables as long as they're bound. However, in this case, since they're separate formulas connected by \u2227, the variables are separate. But in the first part, \u00ac\u2200x... uses x, and the second part \u2200x... uses x again. Wait, that would cause confusion. Let me check. If I write \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Kx), the x in the first part is bound by the universal quantifier, and the x in the second part is also bound by another universal quantifier. In logic, variables are bound locally to their quantifiers, so this is acceptable. The x in each part is a different variable in terms of scope. However, to avoid any confusion, sometimes people use different variables, like \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) \u2227 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 Ky). But the example given in the problem uses the same variable for multiple quantifiers. For instance, in the example, \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc) uses x once, but if there were another \u2200x, it would be okay. Since the problem's example uses x, maybe following that convention is acceptable here. Therefore, I can write the entire formula as \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Kx). \n\nAlternatively, if I had converted \"not all\" into the existential, it would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Kx). But again, the variables here would be x in both parts. However, in the first part, x is existentially quantified, and in the second, universally. That's allowed, but again, variables are bound in their own scope. However, the problem's example uses the universal quantifier approach, so maybe the first version is preferable here.\n\nSo the final formula is the conjunction of the negation of the universal statement for monkeys running and the universal statement for humans being happy. Therefore:\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Kx)\n\nI need to make sure that all the abbreviations are correctly used. O is for monkey, F for will run, N for human, K for happy. Yes. So that's correct. Also, the logical symbols are all standard: \u00ac, \u2200, \u2192, \u2227, etc. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Ox\u2192Fx) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx\u2192Kx)",

The sentence is: \"Every monkey chased Lewis only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The structure seems to be a conditional statement. The phrase \"only if\" usually introduces the necessary condition. So, in logic terms, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. But here, both A and B are statements involving all monkeys.\n\nSo the main structure would be: If every monkey chased Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis. Wait, but the original sentence says \"Every monkey chased Lewis only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So that would be: For every monkey, if they chased Lewis, then they must have kicked Lewis? Or is it a universal statement where the entire \"every monkey chased Lewis\" is the antecedent, and the consequent is \"every monkey kicked Lewis\"?\n\nI think it's the latter. Because \"only if\" in this context connects two universal statements. So the entire \"every monkey chased Lewis\" is the antecedent, and \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is the consequent. So the translation would be: If (for all x, if O(x) then R(x, b)), then (for all x, if O(x) then Q(x, b)). Wait, but maybe the original sentence is using \"every monkey\" in both parts. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal sentence: Every monkey chased Lewis only if every monkey kicked Lewis. So, the \"every monkey chased Lewis\" is the antecedent, and \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" is the necessary condition. So the logical form is: (For all x (O(x) \u2192 R(x, b))) \u2192 (For all x (O(x) \u2192 Q(x, b))). But wait, is that correct? Because \"only if\" can sometimes be tricky. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a universal quantifier over monkeys where for each monkey, if they chased Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis. But that would be different. For example, for each monkey m, if m chased Lewis, then (for all monkeys k, they kicked Lewis). But that seems less likely. The original sentence is structured as \"Every monkey did A only if every monkey did B.\" So the \"only if\" is connecting two universal statements. So the entire universal statement about chasing is conditional on the entire universal statement about kicking. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be: \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). But wait, the problem is that in predicate logic, when you have a conditional between two universally quantified statements, you need to structure it properly. So the whole implication is that if it's true that every monkey chased Lewis, then it must be true that every monkey kicked Lewis. \n\nBut how to write that? The antecedent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb), and the consequent is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). Therefore, the entire formula is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). However, sometimes in logic, when you have a conditional between two universally quantified statements, you can sometimes combine the quantifiers. But in this case, since they are separate, you need to keep them as separate universals. \n\nAlternatively, could it be that for every monkey, if they chased Lewis, then they kicked Lewis? That would be \u2200x ((Ox \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qxb). But that would be different. Let me compare the two interpretations. The original sentence says \"Every monkey chased Lewis only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So if even one monkey didn't kick Lewis, then it can't be that every monkey chased Lewis. So the entire universal about chasing depends on the entire universal about kicking. \n\nFor example, if all monkeys kicked Lewis, then it's possible that all chased him. But if even one didn't kick, then not all chased. So the correct formalization would be that the universal statement of chasing implies the universal statement of kicking. Therefore, the formula is \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Suppose we have \"Every monkey (chased Lewis only if they kicked Lewis)\", which would be different. That would be for each monkey, if they chased Lewis, then they kicked him. Which would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 Qxb ). But the original sentence is \"Every monkey chased Lewis only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\" So it's not about each monkey individually, but the whole group. \n\nSo the correct answer should be the implication between the two universal statements. Therefore, the formalization would be:\n\n(\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb))\n\nBut I need to make sure that the abbreviations are used correctly. The abbreviations given are:\n\nO: [1] is a monkey (so Ox means x is a monkey)\n\nR: [1] chased [2] (so Rxb means x chased b, where b is Lewis)\n\nQ: [1] kicked [2] (so Qxb means x kicked b)\n\nYes. So the formula is as above. The user wants a single well-formed formula, so I need to present that. Also, check if the quantifiers can be merged or if there's a different way, but I think this is the correct approach.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxb)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb)",

The sentence is \"No humans chased a monkey that chased it.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"is a human,\" O for \"is a monkey,\" and R for \"chased.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The main point is that there are no humans who chased a monkey that, in turn, chased the human. So, breaking it down: For any human, it's not the case that they chased a monkey which then chased them.\n\nIn predicate logic, \"No humans...\" translates to a universal quantifier over all humans, stating that for each human, a certain condition does not hold. Alternatively, it could also be phrased using an existential quantifier negated, but usually \"no\" is handled with a universal quantifier.\n\nSo, the structure would be: For all x, if x is a human, then it is not the case that there exists a y such that y is a monkey and x chased y and y chased x. Wait, let me check that again. The original sentence says \"chased a monkey that chased it.\" So the human (x) chased a monkey (y), and that monkey (y) chased the human (x). \n\nSo the condition for the human x is: there exists a y where Oy (y is a monkey) and Rx y (x chased y) and Ry x (y chased x). The entire statement is that there are no such humans, so we negate the existence of such a case. Alternatively, for all humans, it's not the case that they have chased a monkey that chased them.\n\nSo the formalization would start with \u2200x (N x \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (O y \u2227 R x y \u2227 R y x)). Alternatively, it could be written as \u00ac\u2203x (N x \u2227 \u2203y (O y \u2227 R x y \u2227 R y x))). But which is correct?\n\nThe original sentence is \"No humans [did something].\" In predicate logic, \"No A are B\" is typically \u2200x (A x \u2192 \u00acB x). So in this case, \"No humans [chased a monkey that chased it]\" would be \u2200x (N x \u2192 \u00ac[chased a monkey that chased it]). The [chased a monkey...] part would be \u2203y (O y \u2227 R x y \u2227 R y x). Therefore, putting it together: \u2200x (N x \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (O y \u2227 R x y \u2227 R y x)).\n\nAlternatively, using the negation of an existential quantifier, this is equivalent to \u2200x (N x \u2192 \u2200y (\u00acO y \u2228 \u00acR x y \u2228 \u00acR y x)), but that's more complicated. The first version with the negation inside is more straightforward.\n\nSo the correct formalization should be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Rxy \u2227 R yx)). \n\nLet me check again. The sentence says no human did X. X is \"chased a monkey that chased it.\" So for a human x to have done X, there must exist a monkey y such that x chased y and y chased x. Therefore, the negation of that existence for all humans. Hence, \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y(Oy \u2227 Rxy \u2227 Ryx)).\n\nYes, that seems right. I think that's the correct formalization. Let me make sure there are no quantifier scope issues. The existential quantifier for y is inside the negation, so the negation applies to the entire existence of such a y. That makes sense. So the final formula is as above.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00ac\u2203y(Oy\u2227Rxy\u2227Ryx))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to translate the sentence \"Hazel isn't a human unless not all donkeys will attack.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The structure here is \"Hazel isn't a human unless [condition].\" The word \"unless\" usually translates to a logical implication. In English, \"A unless B\" can be interpreted as \"If not B, then A\" or \"A if not B\". Alternatively, it can also be seen as \"\u00acB \u2192 A\" or \"A \u2228 B\". But I need to be careful here.\n\nThe original sentence is \"Hazel isn't a human unless not all donkeys will attack.\" Let me break this down. The main parts are:\n\n- Hazel isn't a human (\u00acN(c), since N is \"[1] is a human\" and c is Hazel)\n- Unless: which introduces the condition \"not all donkeys will attack\". \n\nSo the structure is \"\u00acN(c) unless \u00ac(all donkeys will attack)\". \n\nIn logic, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\". So applying that here, if the condition B is \"not all donkeys will attack\", then the implication would be \"If not (not all donkeys will attack), then \u00acN(c)\". Wait, that might get confusing. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, \"A unless B\" can be translated as \"A \u2228 B\". So here, \"Hazel isn't a human\" (\u00acN(c)) unless \"not all donkeys will attack\" (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)). So combining them as \u00acN(c) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nBut another way to look at it is \"If not B, then A\". Here, B is \"not all donkeys will attack\", so not B would be \"all donkeys will attack\". Therefore, \"If all donkeys will attack, then Hazel isn't a human.\" So that would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acN(c). \n\nWhich of these is correct? Let me check. The original sentence says Hazel isn't a human unless the condition holds. So Hazel being a human would require that the condition holds. In other words, if the condition doesn't hold (i.e., all donkeys will attack), then Hazel isn't a human. Which aligns with the implication: if not (condition), then \u00acN(c). \n\nThe condition here is \"not all donkeys will attack\", so \"not condition\" is \"all donkeys will attack\". Therefore, the implication is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acN(c). \n\nAlternatively, using the equivalence of \"A unless B\" to \"\u00acB \u2192 A\", where A is \u00acN(c) and B is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). Wait, that would be substituting B as \"not all donkeys will attack\". So the implication would be \u00acB \u2192 A, i.e., \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)) \u2192 \u00acN(c). Simplifying \u00ac(\u00ac\u2200x(...)) gives \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx), so again we get \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acN(c). \n\nSo both methods lead to the same formula. Therefore, the correct formalization would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acN(c). \n\nBut let me check if there's another way. The \"unless\" can also be considered as \"\u2228\". So \u00acN(c) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). Which is equivalent to the implication above because A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. So if we have \u00acB \u2192 A, that would be equivalent to B \u2228 A. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe standard translation for \"A unless B\" is \"A \u2228 B\". For example, \"I will go unless it rains\" becomes \"I will go \u2228 it rains\". But in this case, the sentence is \"Hazel isn't a human unless not all donkeys will attack.\" So that would be \u00acN(c) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). Which is equivalent to the implication \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acN(c). Both are equivalent because A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 B. So here, if we take the implication form, it's the same as the disjunction.\n\nSo which form should I use? The problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Both forms are correct, but perhaps the implication is more direct given the structure of the original sentence. However, in predicate logic, both are acceptable. Let me check if there's a standard way to handle \"unless\". \n\nIn many logic textbooks, \"A unless B\" is translated as A \u2228 B. However, sometimes it's also translated as \u00acB \u2192 A. Since both are logically equivalent, either is acceptable. However, considering the original sentence structure, maybe using implication is better here. But perhaps the expected answer is the disjunction. Let me think again.\n\nThe original sentence is \"Hazel isn't a human unless not all donkeys will attack.\" So in terms of \"A unless B\", where A is \"Hazel isn't a human\" and B is \"not all donkeys will attack\". Therefore, the translation would be A \u2228 B, which is \u00acN(c) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). \n\nAlternatively, since \"not all donkeys will attack\" is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acGx), but the problem says to use the given abbreviations. The abbreviation for \"not all donkeys will attack\" would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). So using that, the disjunction is correct.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the implication form. Let me check with an example. Suppose the sentence was \"You pass unless you fail the exam.\" That could be translated as \"You pass \u2228 you fail the exam\", but that's not correct because passing and failing are mutually exclusive. Wait, perhaps that's a bad example. Let me think of another. \n\nActually, \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"if not B, then A\" and also to \"A or B\". So both are correct. However, depending on the context, one might be preferable. Since the problem gives abbreviations, perhaps using the implication is better here. \n\nBut let's look at the example provided. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" which became \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So implications are used there. However, in the case of \"unless\", either form is acceptable. \n\nBut let me check which one is more standard. For instance, if the sentence was \"I will go unless it rains,\" translating to \"Go \u2228 Rain\" or \"If \u00acRain \u2192 Go\". Both are acceptable. However, in predicate logic, when dealing with quantifiers, sometimes implications are easier. \n\nIn this case, the user's sentence is \"Hazel isn't a human unless not all donkeys will attack.\" So using the disjunction would be \u00acN(c) \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx). Alternatively, using implication: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acN(c). Both are equivalent. \n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the implication form. Let me check if there's any reason to prefer one over the other. Since the sentence is structured as \"Hazel isn't a human unless [condition]\", which is similar to \"If [not condition], then Hazel isn't a human\". So the implication seems more direct here. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acN(c). \n\nLet me verify. The original sentence says Hazel is not a human unless the condition (not all donkeys attack) holds. So if all donkeys do attack (i.e., the condition doesn't hold), then Hazel isn't a human. Which is exactly what the implication states. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx) \u2192 \u00acN(c).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Gx)\u2192\u00acNc",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is \"A monkey is happy and every human chased Alfred.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"is a monkey,\" K for \"is happy,\" N for \"is a human,\" R for \"chased,\" and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its two main parts connected by \"and.\" The first part is \"A monkey is happy,\" and the second part is \"every human chased Alfred.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: \"A monkey is happy.\" In predicate logic, when we say \"A monkey is happy,\" that translates to the existence of at least one monkey that is happy. So I should use the existential quantifier \u2203. The structure would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Kx). This means there exists some x such that x is a monkey (Ox) and x is happy (Kx). \n\nNow the second part: \"every human chased Alfred.\" This is a universal statement. All humans have the property of chasing Alfred. So I'll use the universal quantifier \u2200. The structure here would be \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxa). For every x, if x is a human (Nx), then x chased Alfred (Rxa, since a is Alfred).\n\nSince the original sentence connects these two parts with \"and,\" I need to combine them using the logical conjunction \u2227. So the entire formula should be the conjunction of the two parts. Putting it all together, it should look like \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Kx) \u2227 \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Rxa). \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the variables are correctly scoped. The first existential quantifier applies to one variable x, and the universal quantifier uses x as well. However, since they are separate quantifiers, the x in the first part is bound to the existential, and the x in the second is bound to the universal. Even though they use the same variable letter, they are separate because each quantifier has its own scope. That's acceptable in predicate logic as long as there's no overlap in the same scope that could cause confusion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using different variables for clarity, but the problem doesn't require that. The instructions don't mention needing to avoid variable reuse, and since they are separate parts connected by \u2227, it's okay. So the formula is correct as written.\n\nLet me double-check. The first part correctly states there's a monkey who is happy. The second part correctly states all humans chased Alfred. The combination with \u2227 is correct because the original sentence uses \"and\" to connect both statements. \n\nI think that's it. The final formula should be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Kx) \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Rxa).\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox\u2227Kx)\u2227\u2200x(Nx\u2192Rxa)",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then not all donkeys will run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If A, then B. So A is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel,\" and B is \"not all donkeys will run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, R is [1] chased [2]. Since Hazel is the subject and object, both are 'c'. So the negation would be \u00acRcc. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the consequent B is a bit trickier: \"not all donkeys will run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be confusing. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. But here, P and Q are both quantified statements.\n\nLet me parse it again. The statement is \"not all donkeys will run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" Let me rephrase this as: If not all donkeys will run, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel. Wait, no. Wait, \"only if\" reverses the direction. So if we have \"A only if B,\" that's A \u2192 B. So here, the \"A\" part is \"not all donkeys will run,\" and the \"B\" part is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" Therefore, B would be: (\u00ac\u2200 donkeys run) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200 donkeys kicked Hazel).\n\nBut let me check. Let me think. Let me denote:\n\nLet me call the first part of B as P: \"not all donkeys will run.\" Which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx). Because \"all donkeys will run\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx), so the negation is \u00ac\u2200x(...), which is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00ac(Mx \u2192 Fx)), but maybe it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) for simplicity.\n\nThen the second part Q is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" Similarly, \"all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qx c). So the negation is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc).\n\nTherefore, the \"only if\" translates to P \u2192 Q. So B is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is: \u00acRcc \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc)].\n\nBut wait, is there a way to simplify this? Let me check if there's any logical equivalences that can make this more concise, but since the instructions just say to use the abbreviations and standard syntax, I think this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"only if\" part can be represented differently. Let me confirm again. The original B is \"not all donkeys will run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" So, in terms of \"only if,\" the structure is:\n\n\"Not all donkeys will run\" only if \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nWhich translates to: If \"not all donkeys will run,\" then \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" Which is exactly what I had before. So that's P \u2192 Q.\n\nSo the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes people prefer to use material implication and handle the structure properly. Also, note that in logic, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to return a well-formed formula, so either form is acceptable. However, since the original is a conditional where the consequent is itself a conditional, we need to keep the parentheses correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can rephrase the consequent as a biconditional? No, because \"only if\" is a one-way implication. So I think the correct translation is as above.\n\nNow, let me check if I have all the abbreviations right. R is [1] chased [2], so Rcc is Hazel chased Hazel, and \u00acRcc is correct. M is [1] is a donkey, so Mx. F is [1] will run, so Fx. Q is [1] kicked [2], so Qx c (since Hazel is the second argument here).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the formalization is:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nBut let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, maybe the \"only if\" is being used in a different way. Let me think again. Suppose the sentence is \"A only if B\" which is A \u2192 B. So here, A is \"not all donkeys will run,\" B is \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" So yes, A \u2192 B. Therefore, the consequent is that implication.\n\nAlternatively, could the original sentence be parsed differently? For example, maybe \"not all donkeys will run only if not all...\" is being read as a biconditional? But no, \"only if\" is typically a one-way implication. So I think my translation is correct.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Qxc))\n\nNow, I need to write this using the standard symbols. Also, check if the quantifiers are correctly placed. Also, note that \"not all\" is translated as \u00ac\u2200, which is correct because \"not all\" is equivalent to \"there exists at least one that doesn't.\"\n\nYes, so I think this is the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Fx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" and B is \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" Let's break down each part.\n\nStarting with A: \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations given, R is \"[1] chased [2]\", and b is Lewis. So, \"Lewis chased Lewis\" would be Rbb. Since it's negated, it becomes \u00acRbb. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow for B: \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is typically translated as P \u2192 Q. But here, the structure is \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" Let me think. \n\n\"No humans are hungry\" can be expressed as \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx), which means there does not exist an x such that x is a human and x is hungry. Alternatively, it's equivalent to \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Both are correct, but maybe one is more useful here. \n\nThe \"only if\" part connects this to \"every human saw Hazel.\" Let's denote \"every human saw Hazel\" as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Px c), since P is \"[1] saw [2]\" and c is Hazel. \n\nPutting \"only if\" together: If we have \"A only if B\", that's A \u2192 B. So in this case, the entire B part of the main conditional is: (No humans are hungry) \u2192 (Every human saw Hazel). \n\nSo combining these, the main conditional is \u00acRbb \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Px c) ]\n\nAlternatively, using the universal quantifier form for \"no humans are hungry\": \u00acRbb \u2192 [ (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc) ]\n\nBut I need to check if that's the correct interpretation. The original sentence is \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" So \"no humans are hungry\" is the antecedent of the \"only if\" clause. So the structure is: If (no humans are hungry), then (every human saw Hazel). Wait, no. Wait, \"only if\" reverses the direction. Let me recall: \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So \"No humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel\" would mean that the truth of \"no humans are hungry\" depends on \"every human saw Hazel\". So it's equivalent to saying that if no humans are hungry, then every human saw Hazel? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the phrasing is a bit confusing here. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the statement is \"A only if B\". This translates to A \u2192 B. So in the original sentence, A is \"no humans are hungry\", and B is \"every human saw Hazel\". Therefore, the entire B part (the consequent of the main conditional) is (No humans are hungry) \u2192 (Every human saw Hazel). Wait, but that would mean that if there are no hungry humans, then every human saw Hazel. But the original sentence is structured as \"no humans are hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" So the \"only if\" is saying that the only way for no humans to be hungry is if every human saw Hazel. So that would be equivalent to: If there are no hungry humans, then it must be that every human saw Hazel. So yes, that would be A \u2192 B where A is \"no humans are hungry\" and B is \"every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is that the entire \"no humans are hungry only if...\" is a conditional. So the main conditional in the original sentence is: If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then [ (no humans are hungry) only if (every human saw Hazel) ]. Which would be \u00acRbb \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc) ].\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the universal quantifier form for \"no humans are hungry\": \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). So the formula becomes \u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc) )\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main connective is the implication from \u00acRbb to the inner implication. So the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc) )\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, sometimes it's preferable to have it in a more standard form. Let me check if there's a way to simplify or rephrase. Alternatively, using material implication, but I think that's already captured here.\n\nAnother way to look at the entire statement is that the consequent of the main conditional is a material implication between two statements: the first being \"no humans are hungry\" (which is equivalent to \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) and the second being \"every human saw Hazel\" (which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)). So the consequent is (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc)).\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc) )\n\nWhich is a well-formed formula in predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me verify each part:\n\n- \u00acRbb: Correct, since Lewis (b) didn't chase Lewis (b).\n- The consequent is an implication where the antecedent is \"no humans are hungry\" (expressed as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) and the consequent is \"every human saw Hazel\" (forall x (Nx \u2192 Pxc)). \n\nYes, this seems correct. So the final formalization should be:\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc) )\n\nAlternatively, using the existential quantifier negation, but since both forms are equivalent, the universal form is probably better here. Also, the problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so this should be acceptable.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRbb \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc) )",

The sentence is \"Every donkey chased Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are M for \"[1] is a donkey\", R for \"[1] chased [2]\", and c is Hazel.\n\nSo first, I need to translate \"Every donkey\" into predicate logic. The structure here is similar to the example provided. In the example, \"Every linguist\" became \u2200x(Lx\u2192...). So here, \"Every donkey\" should be \u2200x(Mx\u2192...).\n\nThen, the action is \"chased Hazel\". Using the abbreviation R, which takes two arguments, the first being the subject and the second the object. Since Hazel is represented by the constant c, the chased relation would be Rxc. Wait, no, wait. Wait, R is [1] chased [2]. So if the donkey (which is x in the universal quantifier) is the one doing the chasing, then it's Rx c. Because x is the donkey, and c is Hazel. So putting it all together, the formula would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 R x c). \n\nLet me check the example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie.\" Abbreviations L for linguist, R for admires, c for Charlie. The formalization was \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So yes, exactly. The structure is the same here. Replace L with M, R remains R, and c is Hazel. So the sentence \"Every donkey chased Hazel\" would be \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxc). \n\nWait, but in the example, Rxc means x admires c. Similarly here, Rxc would mean x chased c. Since Hazel is c, that's correct. So the answer should be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxc). \n\nI don't think there's any need for a different arrangement here. The quantifier is universal, the implication is that if x is a donkey, then x chased c (Hazel). That should capture the original sentence correctly. No need for existential quantifiers or anything else. Just universal, implying the action. Yeah, that makes sense. So the final formula is \u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxc).\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxc)",

        },
        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this logic problem. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no donkeys ate.\" Hmm, first, I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the structure. The main conditional is \"If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then [some consequence].\" The consequence part is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no donkeys ate.\" Wait, \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. So maybe the consequence is structured as a conditional where the antecedent is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" and the consequent is \"no donkeys ate.\" But let me make sure.\n\nSo the entire sentence is: If \u00acP(a,b) (since P is [1] saw [2], so Alfred (a) doesn't see Lewis (b)), then [\u00ac(all donkeys kicked Alfred) only if \u00ac(some donkeys ate)]. Wait, \"no donkeys ate\" would be \"it is not the case that there exists a donkey that ate,\" so \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Alternatively, \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Either way, they are equivalent.\n\nNow, the part after the main if is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no donkeys ate.\" Let me rephrase that. Let me think of \"A only if B\" as A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" and B is \"no donkeys ate.\" So translating that, it would be: \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a))) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Wait, \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is equivalent to \"there exists a donkey that did not kick Alfred,\" which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)). But maybe I need to check that. The negation of \"all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is indeed \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)). But the original says \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" which is that same thing. So the \"only if\" part would be that this existence implies \"no donkeys ate.\" Wait, no. Wait, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So A is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred,\" which is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)), and B is \"no donkeys ate,\" which is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Therefore, the consequence part is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix).\n\nPutting it all together, the main conditional is \u00acP(a,b) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)]. But in logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, maybe I can rephrase the consequence using contrapositive or other equivalences. Let me check if the \"only if\" is correctly captured.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is: If \u00acP(a,b), then (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Q(x,a)) \u2194 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))? Wait, no. Because \"only if\" is one direction. So it's A \u2192 B, not a biconditional. So the consequence is \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(...). Therefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acP(a,b) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)]\n\nBut maybe we can simplify this. Since in logic, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So perhaps the formula can be written as (\u00acP(a,b) \u2227 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a))) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). But the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. Either form is acceptable, but maybe the original structure is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"only if\" is part of the consequent. Let me make sure. The original sentence says: \"If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then [not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no donkeys ate].\" So the \"only if\" is inside the consequent. So the structure is: If A, then (B only if C). Which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So that's how it should be.\n\nNow, let's check the abbreviations. P is [1] saw [2], so P(a,b) is \"Alfred saw Lewis\". The negation is \u00acP(a,b). M is [1] is a donkey. Q is [1] kicked [2], so Q(x,a) is \"x kicked Alfred\". I is [1] ate, so Ix is \"x ate\".\n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u00acP(a,b) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut let's check if the inner implication can be simplified. The consequent of the main implication is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). Alternatively, since \u00ac\u2200x(...) is equivalent to \u2203x(\u00ac(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a))) which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)). So maybe writing it as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acQ(x,a)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). But the problem says to use the abbreviations as given, so perhaps we need to keep it in terms of the original quantifiers.\n\nAlternatively, the contrapositive of the inner implication would be \u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)). But that's a different structure. However, the problem requires translating the original sentence, so we need to stick to the structure given.\n\nTherefore, the final formula is:\n\n\u00acP(a,b) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut let me check for any possible mistakes. For example, is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" correctly represented as \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a))? Yes, because \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Q(x,a)) means all donkeys kicked Alfred, so the negation is correct. And \"no donkeys ate\" is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). So that's correct.\n\nSo the entire formula is as above. Let me write it in the required syntax, making sure to use the correct symbols and structure.\n</think>\n\n\u00acPab\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Qxa)\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Ix))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"Every donkey is happy unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" The abbreviations provided are M for \"is a donkey,\" K for \"is happy,\" R for \"chased,\" and a for Alfred.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The key part here is \"unless,\" which in logic usually translates to a disjunction where one part is the negation of a condition. The general structure of \"A unless B\" can be represented as \u00acB \u2192 A, or equivalently, A \u2228 B. But I need to make sure which interpretation fits here.\n\nThe sentence says that every donkey is happy unless every donkey chased Alfred. So, if it's not the case that every donkey chased Alfred, then every donkey is happy. Alternatively, either every donkey is happy, or every donkey chased Alfred. Wait, but \"unless\" can sometimes be a bit tricky. Let me think again. The original structure is \"Every donkey is happy unless [condition].\" The condition here is \"every donkey chased Alfred.\" So, if the condition is not met (i.e., not every donkey chased Alfred), then every donkey is happy. Therefore, the implication would be \u00ac(every donkey chased Alfred) \u2192 (every donkey is happy). \n\nLet me formalize that. The first part is the negation of \"every donkey chased Alfred.\" In predicate logic, \"every donkey chased Alfred\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa). The negation of that is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa). However, in logic, the negation of a universal quantifier becomes an existential quantifier with the negated inner part. So \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa). \n\nSo the implication would be: If \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa), then \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). Wait, but the original sentence is \"Every donkey is happy unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" So the structure is: If not (every donkey chased Alfred), then every donkey is happy. Therefore, the implication is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nAlternatively, another way to represent \"A unless B\" is A \u2228 B. Here, A is \"every donkey is happy\" and B is \"every donkey chased Alfred.\" So that would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa). But I need to check if that's equivalent. However, \"unless\" can sometimes be exclusive, but in logic, we usually take it as inclusive. So \"A unless B\" is equivalent to A \u2228 B. \n\nBut let's check both approaches. Let's see. If we take the implication approach: \u00acB \u2192 A, which is equivalent to A \u2228 B. So both approaches should lead to the same formula. \n\nSo, the first approach gives us \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). The second approach gives us \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx) \u2228 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa). \n\nBut which one is more appropriate here? The original sentence says that every donkey is happy unless every donkey chased Alfred. So if every donkey did chase Alfred, then it's not required for them to be happy. But if not every donkey chased Alfred, then they are all happy. \n\nAlternatively, the \"unless\" here could be interpreted as an exception: the donkeys are happy except when all of them chased Alfred. So in that case, the formula would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 (Kx \u2228 \u2200y (My \u2192 Rya))). Wait, but that would be different. Because if we have for each donkey, Kx unless \u2200y... But that's not the case here. The original sentence is about every donkey being happy as a whole, not each individual donkey. \n\nWait, the original sentence is \"Every donkey is happy unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" So the entire set of donkeys being happy is conditional on not every donkey chasing Alfred. So the correct formalization would be that if it's not the case that every donkey chased Alfred, then every donkey is happy. Which is the implication approach. \n\nSo translating that: If not (for all x, if Mx then Rxa), then for all x, if Mx then Kx. \n\nSo the formula would be \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nBut in predicate logic, it's also possible to write this using the existential quantifier. Since \u00ac\u2200x P is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP, but here P is (Mx \u2192 Rxa). So \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) is equivalent to \u2203x \u00ac(Mx \u2192 Rxa). And \u00ac(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to A \u2227 \u00acB. Therefore, \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa). \n\nTherefore, the implication can be rewritten as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nSo which form should I use? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations include M, K, R, and a. The original sentence uses \"every donkey chased Alfred\" which is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa). The negation of that is \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa). \n\nSo the formula is: If there exists a donkey that didn't chase Alfred, then all donkeys are happy. \n\nTherefore, the formalization would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nAlternatively, using the original implication with the negated universal. But both are equivalent. However, the problem might expect one form over the other. \n\nLooking back at the example provided in the problem statement: \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So they use the universal quantifier directly. \n\nIn the example, the implication is straightforward. So perhaps for the current problem, the expected answer is to use the implication with the negated universal. \n\nBut let's check the two possibilities again. \n\nOption 1: \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx)\n\nOption 2: \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx)\n\nSince both are equivalent, but the problem may prefer one. Given that the example uses universal quantifiers directly, maybe the first option is more in line with that. However, in practice, when translating, it's more common to use the existential form because it's more explicit. \n\nBut I need to check if the problem expects the use of the abbreviations as given. The abbreviations for R is \"[1] chased [2]\", so Rxa would be correct. \n\nAnother way to think about \"unless\": \"A unless B\" can be read as \"A is true except when B is true.\" So if B is true, then A may or may not be true. But if B is not true, then A must be true. \n\nSo in this case, if \"every donkey chased Alfred\" is B, then \"every donkey is happy\" is A. So A unless B translates to \u00acB \u2192 A. \n\nWhich is exactly what we have. So \u00acB \u2192 A, where B is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa), and A is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nTherefore, the formula is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nBut again, since \u00ac\u2200x P is \u2203x \u00acP, and \u00ac(Mx \u2192 Rxa) is Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa. \n\nSo perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the existential quantifier. However, in the example given, they used the universal directly. Let me check the example again. \n\nIn the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So they didn't convert it into any other form. Therefore, perhaps for consistency, the answer should use the negation of the universal directly. \n\nBut in that case, the formula would be \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nBut how to write that in standard predicate logic syntax? The problem says to use standard symbols. \n\nSo the final formula would be: \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nBut maybe the problem expects the use of the existential quantifier. Let me think again. \n\nAnother way to look at the sentence is that it's a conditional statement where the antecedent is the negation of \"every donkey chased Alfred,\" leading to the consequent that every donkey is happy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the entire statement to be expressed as a biconditional or something else. But no, \"unless\" is typically an implication. \n\nAlternatively, could the sentence be interpreted as \"For every donkey, it is happy unless every donkey chased Alfred\"? But that would be different. In that case, each donkey's happiness depends on whether all donkeys chased Alfred. But the original sentence is \"Every donkey is happy unless...\" which seems to apply to the entire set. \n\nSo the correct formalization is that the entire set of donkeys being happy is conditional on not all of them chasing Alfred. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is the implication between the negation of the universal statement and the universal happy statement. \n\nSo the answer is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nBut to check if that's acceptable. Let's see. The problem allows using the standard logical symbols, including quantifiers and connectives. So using \u00ac, \u2200, \u2203, etc., is allowed. \n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the use of the existential quantifier. Let me check if there's any other way. \n\nAlternatively, the sentence can be rephrased as \"If not all donkeys chased Alfred, then all donkeys are happy.\" Which is the same as above. \n\nYes. So the formula is as I wrote. \n\nBut let me write it out properly with the abbreviations. \n\nThe first part is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa), and the second part is \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). So the entire formula is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nYes, that should be correct. \n\nAlternatively, using the existential form: \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nWhich is equivalent. Which one is preferable? The example uses the universal directly. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the universal. However, in logic, when you negate a universal, it's often converted to an existential. But since the problem allows using any standard symbols, both are correct. However, since the example didn't convert the universal, maybe we should follow that. \n\nBut I need to check the problem's example again. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which became \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So they directly used the universal. If the problem expects similar style, then perhaps the answer should be written with the negated universal. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 Kx). \n\nBut let me check if that's well-formed. Yes. The left side is a negated universal, the right is a universal. The implication between them. \n\nYes. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192Kx)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\" And I need to translate it into predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence has two parts connected by \"but\". In logic, \"but\" is usually treated the same as \"and\", so the structure is something like A \u2227 B. \n\nThe first part is \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred\". The abbreviation for \"chased\" is R, which is [1] chased [2]. Since both the subject and object are Alfred, this would be Raa. But since it's \"didn't chase\", we need to negate it. So that part becomes \u00acRaa.\n\nThe second part is a bit trickier: \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\" Let's parse that. The inner part is \"Lewis isn't a donkey\". The abbreviation for \"is a donkey\" is M, which is [1] is a donkey. So \"Lewis isn't a donkey\" would be \u00acMb. Then, the whole phrase is \"it is not the case that...\" which is another negation. So we have \u00ac(\u00acMb). But in logic, double negation cancels out, so this simplifies to Mb. However, I should probably represent it as \u00ac\u00acMb to stay true to the original sentence's structure unless the problem expects simplification. Wait, the instructions don't mention simplification, just to formalize the sentence. So maybe I should keep the double negation. Let me check the original sentence again: \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\" So that's \u00ac(\u00acMb). But in predicate logic, we can write that as \u00ac\u00acMb. However, sometimes people might write it as Mb directly. But since the instructions say to use the abbreviations given and not add anything else, maybe I need to represent the negation as stated. Let me think. The original statement is a negation of \"Lewis isn't a donkey\", which is \u00ac(\u00acMb). So yes, that's equivalent to Mb, but perhaps the correct way here is to write it as \u00ac\u00acMb. Wait, but in formal logic, it's acceptable to have double negations. However, the problem says to return a well-formed formula. So either form is acceptable, but maybe the problem expects the simplified version. However, since the user might want the direct translation without simplification, perhaps I should keep the double negation. Let me see the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). They didn't simplify anything. So maybe I should do the same here. The original sentence says \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey\", which is a double negative. So translating that directly would be \u00ac(\u00acMb). But in predicate logic, parentheses are important. So the second part is \u00ac(\u00acMb). So combining both parts, the entire formula would be \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acMb. Alternatively, since \u2227 is the conjunction, connecting the two parts. \n\nSo putting it all together: The first part is \u00acRaa, the second is \u00ac\u00acMb. Therefore, the entire formula is \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acMb. \n\nLet me check the abbreviations again. R is [1] chased [2], a is Alfred. So Raa is Alfred chased Alfred. The negation is correct. M is [1] is a donkey, b is Lewis. So Mb is \"Lewis is a donkey\". The original sentence says \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey\", which is \u00ac(\u00acMb). So yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the formalization should be \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acMb. Alternatively, if the system expects simplification, but the example didn't simplify, so I think the correct answer is to keep the double negation. Therefore, the final formula is \u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acMb.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRaa \u2227 \u00ac\u00acMb",

I need to translate the sentence \"If a donkey kicked Lewis, then no donkeys chased Alfred.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. \n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. So the overall structure will be A \u2192 B.\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"a donkey kicked Lewis\". The abbreviations say M is \"[1] is a donkey\" and Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\". Also, b is Lewis. So \"a donkey kicked Lewis\" would be an existential statement, right? Because it's saying there exists a donkey that kicked Lewis. So that would be \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qx b). Wait, but sometimes \"a donkey\" might be treated as a unique one, but in predicate logic, \"a donkey\" here is just existential unless specified otherwise. So yes, \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qx b).\n\nNow the consequent: \"no donkeys chased Alfred\". The abbreviation R is \"[1] chased [2]\" and a is Alfred. So \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" means that for all donkeys, they did not chase Alfred. So \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acRy a). Because if y is a donkey, then it does not chase a.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is: \u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qx b) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acRy a).\n\nWait, but I need to check if variables are properly used. The antecedent uses x, and the consequent uses y. Since they are different variables, that's okay. Also, in the consequent, the universal quantifier comes after the implication. So the structure is correct. \n\nIs there any possibility of confusion? Let me think. The antecedent is about the existence of a donkey that kicked Lewis, and the consequent says that all donkeys didn't chase Alfred. The translation seems to capture that. So the final formula should be:\n\n(\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Qxb)) \u2192 \u2200y (My \u2192 \u00acRya)\n\nI need to make sure that the parentheses are correctly placed.

The sentence is \"Hazel isn't hungry if and only if a human saw Hazel.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is an \"if and only if\" statement, which in logic is the biconditional operator \u2194. So the left side is \"Hazel isn't hungry,\" and the right side is \"a human saw Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the left side: \"Hazel isn't hungry.\" The abbreviation for \"is hungry\" is L. Since Hazel is represented by c, this would be \u00acLc. Because it's \"isn't hungry,\" we negate Lc.\n\nNow the right side: \"a human saw Hazel.\" The abbreviation for \"[1] is a human\" is N, and \"[1] saw [2]\" is P. So we need to say there exists some human (let's use variable x) such that x is a human (Nx) and x saw Hazel (Pxc). So that part would be \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Pxc).\n\nPutting it all together with the biconditional: \u00acLc \u2194 \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Pxc). \n\nWait, let me check.

The sentence to formalize is: \"Not all monkeys will run and no donkeys saw Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"is a monkey\", F for \"will run\", M for \"is a donkey\", P for \"saw\", and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its two parts connected by \"and\". The first part is \"Not all monkeys will run,\" and the second part is \"no donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Not all monkeys will run.\" In predicate logic, \"all monkeys will run\" would typically be \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Fx). But since it's \"not all,\" I need to negate that. So the negation of \u2200x(A) is \u2203x(\u00acA). Applying that here, it becomes \u2203x(\u00ac(Ox \u2192 Fx)). However, I remember that the negation of an implication (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to A \u2227 \u00acB. So instead of writing \u00ac(Ox \u2192 Fx), it's better to express it as Ox \u2227 \u00acFx. Therefore, the first part becomes \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx). That makes sense because there exists at least one monkey that won't run.\n\nNow the second part: \"no donkeys saw Hazel.\" \"No donkeys\" means that for all donkeys, they didn't see Hazel. So using the universal quantifier, \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxc). Here, Mx is \"x is a donkey,\" and Pxc is \"x saw Hazel (c).\" So if x is a donkey, then x did not see Hazel.\n\nPutting both parts together with the conjunction \"and,\" the entire formula should be the conjunction of the two parts. So the first part \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx) and the second part \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxc). Therefore, combining them with \u2227: \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2227 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxc).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the variables are properly scoped. The first part uses \u2203x and the second uses \u2200x. Since they are separate quantifiers with the same variable name but different scopes, it's acceptable because the x in the first is a different bound variable from the x in the second. Alternatively, to avoid confusion, maybe using different variables, but the problem doesn't specify that, and the example uses the same variable in different quantifiers. For example, in the example given, \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), so same variable x. So here, using x in both is okay as long as they are in different scopes. So the formula as written is correct.\n\nLet me check again. The first part is \u2203x (monkey x and not run x). The second is \u2200x (if donkey x, then not saw x Hazel). So combining them with \u2227. Yes, that's correct. So the final formula is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acFx) \u2227 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acPxc).\n\nI think that's it. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any parts. \"Not all monkeys will run\" is correctly negated as \"there exists a monkey that won't run,\" and \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" is \"all donkeys did not see Hazel.\" Yes, that seems right. Also, the abbreviations are correctly applied. O for monkey, F for run, M for donkey, P for saw with the second argument being c (Hazel). All good.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox\u2227\u00acFx)\u2227\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acPxc)",

The sentence to formalize is: \"A monkey is hungry and Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are O for \"[1] is a monkey,\" L for \"[1] is hungry,\" R for \"[1] chased [2],\" and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components. The first part is \"A monkey is hungry.\" In predicate logic, \"A monkey\" translates to an existential quantifier since it's stating that there exists at least one monkey with the property of being hungry. So, using the abbreviation O for being a monkey and L for being hungry, this part would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). The existential quantifier \u2203x means \"there exists an x such that...\" and the conjunction \u2227 connects the two predicates Ox and Lx.\n\nThe second part of the sentence is \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\" Here, Hazel is referred to twice, once as the subject and once as the object. Since the abbreviation c represents Hazel, this translates to \u00acRcc. The negation symbol \u00ac is used because it's \"didn't chase,\" and R is the chase relation with both arguments being c.\n\nNow, the original sentence combines these two parts with \"and,\" so we need to connect the two formulas with the conjunction symbol \u2227. Putting it all together, the entire formalization should be the conjunction of the existential statement and the negated chase relation. So the full formula would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2227 \u00acRcc.\n\nI need to check if this is correct. Let's verify each part again. The first part correctly uses \u2203 to state there's at least one monkey that is hungry. The second part correctly uses \u00acRcc to say Hazel didn't chase herself. The conjunction connects both parts as required by the original sentence. I don't see any quantifiers that need to be added or removed, and the use of the abbreviations aligns with the given definitions. So this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Ox\u2227Lx)\u2227\u00acRcc",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is: \"No humans ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\" The abbreviations given are N for \"is a human,\" I for \"ate,\" P for \"saw,\" a for Alfred, and c for Hazel.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence. The phrase \"No humans ate\" would typically be translated as \"For all x, if x is a human, then x did not eat.\" So that's \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx). But then there's the \"just in case\" part, which is a bit tricky. \"Just in case\" usually introduces a condition. In logic, this is often a biconditional (\u2194), but sometimes it can be a conditional. The phrase \"A just in case B\" is usually interpreted as \"B is a necessary condition for A,\" which would be A \u2192 B. Alternatively, some might interpret it as B being a sufficient condition, but I think in this context, it's more about necessity.\n\nSo the full sentence is saying that \"No humans ate\" is true if Alfred doesn't see Hazel. So the whole structure is \"No humans ate\" \u2194 \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\" Wait, but \"just in case\" can sometimes mean \"if and only if,\" but maybe here it's a bit different. Let me think again. The phrase \"A just in case B\" can be read as \"A is true exactly when B is true,\" which would be a biconditional. So if the sentence is \"No humans ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel,\" that would translate to \"No humans ate if and only if Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\"\n\nSo the first part is \"No humans ate,\" which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx). The second part is \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel,\" which is \u00acPac. So the whole formula would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx) \u2194 \u00acPac. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"just in case\" is used to mean \"if\" rather than \"if and only if.\" But the example given in the problem uses \"just in case\" as a biconditional. Wait, no, the example is different. The example was \"Every linguist admires Charlie,\" which is a straightforward universal. The current sentence is more complex. Let me think again.\n\nThe structure is: \"No humans ate\" is true exactly when \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" is true. So the entire statement is a biconditional between the two. So the translation would be (\u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx)) \u2194 (\u00acPac). That seems correct. So the final formula would be \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx) \u2194 \u00acPac.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the \"just in case\" is only one direction. For example, sometimes \"just in case\" can be read as \"if not B, then A,\" but I'm not sure. Let me think. If someone says \"I'll bring an umbrella just in case it rains,\" that usually means \"if it rains, I'll bring an umbrella,\" but also maybe \"if I don't bring an umbrella, then it's not raining,\" which is the contrapositive. So that would be a biconditional. But in this case, the original sentence is \"No humans ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\" So if Alfred doesn't see Hazel, then no humans ate, and if no humans ate, then Alfred doesn't see Hazel. That seems a bit odd. Maybe the intended meaning is that the condition for no humans eating is that Alfred doesn't see Hazel. So it's a biconditional. But maybe the correct translation is that the absence of humans eating is equivalent to Alfred not seeing Hazel. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"just in case\" here is being used as a sufficient condition. For example, \"No humans ate if Alfred doesn't see Hazel,\" meaning that if Alfred doesn't see Hazel, then no humans ate. But the \"just in case\" might be indicating that the condition is necessary. Hmm. \n\nBut given that \"just in case\" is often used to mean that something is true if and only if a condition holds, I think the biconditional is the right approach here. So the correct formalization would be the biconditional between the universal statement and the negation of Pac. So the final formula is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx) \u2194 \u00acPac. Let me check the abbreviations again. P is \"[1] saw [2]\", so Pac is \"Alfred saw Hazel,\" and \u00acPac is \"Alfred didn't see Hazel.\" The universal statement is \"No humans ate,\" which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acIx). So combining them with a biconditional gives the correct translation.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acIx)\u2194\u00acPac",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"If a monkey chased Hazel, then a human chased Lewis.\" And I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. The structure is a conditional: If A, then B. Where A is \"a monkey chased Hazel\" and B is \"a human chased Lewis.\" \n\nStarting with A: \"a monkey chased Hazel.\" The abbreviation for being a monkey is O[1], and R is [1] chased [2]. Hazel is denoted by c. So, \"a monkey chased Hazel\" would be an existential statement? Wait, no. Wait, in English, \"a monkey\" here is an indefinite article. But in logic, when we have \"a monkey\", it's usually an existential quantifier. So, there exists some monkey that chased Hazel. So A would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc). Because we need to say there's some x that is a monkey (Ox) and that x chased c (Hazel).\n\nThen the consequent B: \"a human chased Lewis.\" Similarly, \"a human\" would be \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryb), since N is [1] is a human, and Lewis is b. So Ryb would mean y chased Lewis.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire implication would be: If there exists an x such that Ox and Rxc, then there exists a y such that Ny and Ryb. So the formula would be (\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc)) \u2192 (\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryb)). \n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, sometimes variables can be reused if they are in different scopes. But here, x and y are separate variables, which is fine. Also, since the antecedent and consequent are both existential statements, the entire implication is correct.\n\nLet me check if there's any other way. For example, could the antecedent be \"If a monkey (i.e., for any monkey?) chased Hazel...\"? No, because the original sentence uses \"a monkey\", which is an existential, not universal. So if there is any monkey that chased Hazel, then there is a human that chased Lewis. So yes, the translation seems right.\n\nSo the final formula is: (\u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc)) \u2192 (\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryb)). \n\nBut since in predicate logic, we can use the same variable letter if they are in different scopes, but it's better to use different variables to avoid confusion. So using x and y is okay. Also, the abbreviations are correctly applied. O for monkey, R for chased, c for Hazel, N for human, b for Lewis. All correct.\n\nI don't think there's any need for universal quantifiers here. The original sentence isn't saying \"All monkeys chased Hazel...\" but rather \"If a monkey (i.e., some monkey) chased Hazel, then...\" So existential quantifiers are appropriate here. \n\nTherefore, the formalization should be the implication of the two existential statements.\n</think>\n\n(\u2203x(Ox \u2227 Rxc)) \u2192 (\u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ryb))",

The sentence is \"A monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is a human.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure is \"A monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is a human.\" The \"only if\" part usually translates to a conditional where the consequent is the \"only if\" clause. So, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. But I need to make sure about the subjects here.\n\nThe subject here is \"A monkey chased Hazel.\" So, the entire statement is saying that if a monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel must be a human. So, the antecedent is \"there exists a monkey who chased Hazel,\" and the consequent is \"Hazel is a human.\"\n\nLooking at the abbreviations: O is \"[1] is a monkey,\" R is \"[1] chased [2],\" c is Hazel, and N is \"[1] is a human.\"\n\nSo, the antecedent would be that there exists some x (a monkey) such that x chased Hazel. In symbols, that's \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc). Wait, because \"a monkey\" implies existence, right? So, \"A monkey chased Hazel\" would be \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc). Then, the \"only if\" part is Nc (since c is Hazel, and N is being human).\n\nPutting it together, the whole statement is: If \u2203x (Ox \u2227 Rxc), then Nc.

The phrase \"A only if B\" is logically equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, the entire \"A monkey chased Hazel\" is A, and B is \"Hazel is a human.\" Therefore, the correct translation would be that if there exists a monkey that chased Hazel, then Hazel is human.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"No donkeys will attack if and only if no humans are hungry.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The main structure is a biconditional (if and only if). On the left side, \"No donkeys will attack.\" On the right side, \"no humans are hungry.\"\n\nStarting with the left part: \"No donkeys will attack.\" In predicate logic, \"No X are Y\" is usually translated as \u2200x (Xx \u2192 \u00acYx). So here, for donkeys (M) not attacking (G). So it should be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx). Wait, but \"No donkeys will attack\" could also be interpreted as there does not exist a donkey that will attack. That would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Gx). Which one is correct? Both are equivalent. Because \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx) is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Gx). So either form is acceptable. But maybe the first one is more straightforward here.\n\nNow the right part: \"No humans are hungry.\" Similarly, that would be \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). Or \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly). Again, same choice. Since the original uses \"no humans,\" maybe using the universal quantifier is better here.\n\nSo putting it all together with the biconditional. The entire statement is a biconditional between the two parts. So the formula would be:\n\n(\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx)) \u2194 (\u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))\n\nBut wait, variables are bound, so the x and y are just placeholders. It's okay to have different variables. Alternatively, since they are separate quantifiers, it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the same variable, but since they are in different scopes, it's allowed. But using different variables is safer to avoid confusion.\n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. So combining both parts with \u2194. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes \"if and only if\" at the sentence level translates directly to \u2194 between the two propositions. Here, the two propositions are \"No donkeys attack\" and \"No humans are hungry.\" So yes, the biconditional between them.\n\nSo the formalization would be:\n\n(\u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acGx)) \u2194 (\u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))\n\nAlternatively, using the existential forms:\n\n(\u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Gx)) \u2194 (\u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))\n\nBut since the question didn't specify which form to use, either is acceptable. However, the example given in the problem uses the universal form for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So following that example, using universal quantifiers for \"no X are Y\" by using the implication with negation in the consequent is probably preferred here.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the first version.\n\nAnother check: The original sentence is a biconditional. So both directions must hold. So if all donkeys don't attack, then no humans are hungry, and vice versa. The formalization captures that with \u2194.\n\nNow, check the abbreviations:\n\nM: [1] is a donkey\n\nG: [1] will attack\n\nN: [1] is a human\n\nL: [1] is hungry\n\nYes, that's correctly used in the formula. The variables x and y are bound by the quantifiers. Since they are separate quantifiers, using different variables is okay. But in predicate logic, the names of the variables don't matter as long as they are bound. So we could even use x in both, but that might be confusing. However, standard practice is to use different variables if they are in different scopes. So I think the formula is correct as written.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acGx) \u2194 \u2200y(Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no syntax issues. In standard predicate logic, the parentheses are important. Also, the biconditional connects the two universal statements. So yes, that's correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acGx)\u2194\u2200y(Ny\u2192\u00acLy)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If Alfred will run, then every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" The abbreviations provided are F for \"[1] will run\" with a referring to Alfred, O for \"[1] is a monkey\", L for \"[1] is hungry\", and N for \"[1] is a human\".\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If Alfred runs, then [some condition]. The consequent here is a bit complex: \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\"\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"Alfred will run\" translates to F(a). \n\nNow, the consequent: \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So here, the statement is saying that for every monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. Wait, but the structure is \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" which might mean that the entire condition \"no humans are hungry\" is the necessary condition for \"every monkey is hungry\". Hmm, maybe I need to parse this more carefully.\n\nLet me rephrase the consequent: \"Every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" So, the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" part. That is, if every monkey is hungry, then it must be that no humans are hungry. Wait, but the original structure is \"if Alfred runs, then [every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry]\". So the consequent is a conditional where the antecedent is \"every monkey is hungry\" and the consequent is \"no humans are hungry\". But how does that fit?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The phrase \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the original is \"Every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry,\" then that would be: For all x, if O(x) then L(x) only if (for all y, if N(y) then not L(y))? Wait, no. The \"only if\" is connecting the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" with \"no humans are hungry\". Let me think of it as a universal statement. Let me rephrase the consequent as: If every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry. So that would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). Wait, but that might not capture the original structure correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the \"only if\" is part of each monkey's condition. Let me see.\n\nAnother approach: The original sentence can be read as \"If Alfred runs, then (for every monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry).\" But that seems too strong because \"no humans are hungry\" would have to hold whenever a monkey is hungry. But maybe that's the case. Let's parse the original sentence again: \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" So for each monkey, being hungry requires that no humans are hungry. So, for all x, if O(x) and L(x), then \u00ac\u2203y (N(y) \u2227 L(y)). Alternatively, for all x, (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))). Which would be equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent of the \"only if\". So \"every monkey is hungry\" only if \"no humans are hungry\". Which would translate to (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). But the original sentence is structured as \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\", which would be equivalent to saying that if every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry. But the problem is that the original sentence is in the context of a conditional: If Alfred runs, then [this implication]. \n\nBut let's check the exact wording. The sentence is: \"If Alfred will run, then every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" So the main conditional is F(a) \u2192 [consequent]. The consequent is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\". Let's focus on the consequent. \n\nIn logic, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Here, A is \"every monkey is hungry\" and B is \"no humans are hungry\". Therefore, the consequent would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). Wait, but that's a conditional where the antecedent is \"every monkey is hungry\" and the consequent is \"no humans are hungry\". So the entire consequent of the main conditional is this implication. \n\nBut that would mean that if Alfred runs, then whenever every monkey is hungry, it must be that no humans are hungry. However, the original sentence might be intending that for each monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. Which would be a different structure. Let me think again. \n\nThe phrase \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\" can be ambiguous. Let's consider two interpretations:\n\n1. For all monkeys, if a monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry. This would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))). Which simplifies to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))). \n\n2. If all monkeys are hungry, then no humans are hungry. This would be (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy).\n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The original sentence uses \"every monkey is hungry only if...\", which is similar to \"All A are B only if C\", which is typically interpreted as \"If all A are B, then C\". So in this case, the second interpretation. Therefore, the consequent is (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nTherefore, the entire formula would be F(a) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy) ].\n\nBut wait, in predicate logic, implications can be rearranged. The formula A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So maybe we can write it as (F(a) \u2227 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). However, the original structure is F(a) \u2192 [B \u2192 C], which is logically equivalent. But perhaps the problem expects the first form. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me check the example given. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the structure is straightforward. \n\nIn the current problem, the main connective is a conditional: If F(a), then ... \n\nThe ... part is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" As discussed, that's (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nPutting it all together, the formula is F(a) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy) ].\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can also nest the quantifiers. Let me check if there's a way to simplify this. However, the structure seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"only if\" is being used per monkey. Let me think again. Suppose the sentence was \"Every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\" If we take \"only if\" as per individual, then for each monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. So \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy) ). Which is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy)) ). \n\nIn this case, the consequent of the main conditional would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy)) ). \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The difference between the two interpretations is significant. Let's consider an example. Suppose there are two monkeys, and one is hungry while the other isn't. In the first interpretation (if all monkeys are hungry, then no humans are hungry), then as long as not all monkeys are hungry, the implication holds regardless of humans. But in the second interpretation (each monkey's hunger implies no humans are hungry), then if even one monkey is hungry, then no humans can be hungry. \n\nThe original sentence is \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\". The wording \"every monkey is hungry\" suggests that the entire set being hungry is the antecedent. So the correct interpretation is likely the first one: if all monkeys are hungry, then no humans are hungry. Therefore, the consequent is (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let's check the example again. The example's sentence is \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which becomes \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). Here, \"every linguist\" is directly translated as a universal quantifier. \n\nIn our problem, the phrase \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" is similar to \"every linguist admires...\" but with a conditional. So perhaps the structure is similar. \n\nIf we take \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" as a universal statement where for each monkey, being hungry implies something. Wait, but \"only if\" is a conditional. So \"Every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\" could be read as \"For every monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry.\" Which would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))). \n\nThis would mean that whenever a monkey is hungry, no humans can be hungry. This is a stronger condition than the previous interpretation. For example, if even one monkey is hungry, then no humans can be hungry. Whereas the other interpretation says that if all monkeys are hungry, then no humans can be hungry. \n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The original sentence uses \"every monkey is hungry only if...\" which is a bit ambiguous. But in formal logic, \"only if\" typically introduces a necessary condition. So \"Every monkey is hungry only if...\" means that the condition (no humans are hungry) is necessary for every monkey being hungry. So it's equivalent to: If every monkey is hungry, then the condition must hold. Which is the first interpretation. \n\nBut sometimes, people might interpret it as for each monkey, being hungry requires the condition. For example, \"I will go only if it is sunny\" means that if I go, it must be sunny. Similarly, \"Every monkey is hungry only if...\" would mean that if a monkey is hungry, then the condition holds. But here, the condition is \"no humans are hungry\", which is a universal statement. \n\nSo if we take the per-monkey approach, then for each monkey, if it's hungry, then no humans are hungry. Which would be \u2200x ( (Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy) ). \n\nThis is equivalent to \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))). \n\nBut this would mean that whenever any monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry. Whereas the other interpretation (if all monkeys are hungry, then no humans are hungry) allows for cases where some monkeys are hungry and some humans are hungry, as long as not all monkeys are hungry. \n\nThe original sentence is a bit ambiguous, but given that the example uses a universal quantifier for \"every linguist\", perhaps the intended interpretation here is that the entire \"every monkey is hungry\" is the antecedent. Therefore, the consequent is (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nSo putting it all together, the entire formula is F(a) \u2192 [ (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Lx)) \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy) ].\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. However, the problem requires using the given abbreviations and standard syntax. Let me check if this is the correct structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the main implication can be rephrased. Let's consider that the original sentence is: If Alfred runs, then (for all monkeys, if they are hungry then no humans are hungry). Which would be F(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))). \n\nThis would be the case if the \"only if\" is per-monkey. Which is different from the previous approach. \n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, perhaps looking at the example helps. The example's sentence is \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which is \u2200x (Lx \u2192 Rxc). So when the subject is \"every linguist\", it's a universal quantifier over x where Lx implies something. \n\nIn the current problem, \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\" could be structured similarly. If we think of it as \"For every monkey, if it is hungry, then [condition]\", then the structure would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 ...)). \n\nBut what is the condition? The \"only if\" part is \"no humans are hungry\", which is \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nTherefore, the consequent would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))). \n\nThis would mean that for every monkey, if it's hungry, then no humans are hungry. Which is a stronger condition than the other interpretation. \n\nBut which one is correct? Let's think of natural language examples. Suppose the sentence is \"Every student passes only if the exam is easy.\" This would mean that if any student passes, then the exam must be easy. So for every student, if they pass, then the exam is easy. Which is \u2200x (Sx \u2192 (Px \u2192 E)). \n\nIn this case, the structure is \u2200x (Sx \u2192 (Px \u2192 E)). Which is equivalent to \u2200x ( (Sx \u2227 Px) \u2192 E ). \n\nSimilarly, in our problem, \"every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry\" would mean that for every monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. So \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))). \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be F(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))). \n\nLet me verify this. Suppose Alfred runs. Then, for every monkey, if it is hungry, then no humans are hungry. \n\nThis seems to capture the intended meaning. If Alfred runs, then whenever a monkey is hungry, there can't be any hungry humans. \n\nAlternatively, if the original sentence had said \"Every monkey is hungry if and only if no humans are hungry,\" that would be a biconditional. But here it's only \"only if\". \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is likely F(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy))). \n\nLet me check if this can be simplified. The inner part is Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). Since \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy) is equivalent to \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly), which is \"no humans are hungry\". \n\nSo the entire formula is F(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ly))). \n\nBut using the given abbreviations, we need to use N and L as predicates. The correct way is to use \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy). \n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\nF(a) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 (Lx \u2192 \u2200y (Ny \u2192 \u00acLy)))\n\nThis uses the abbreviations provided: F for [1] will run (with a as Alfred), O for [1] is a monkey, L for [1] is hungry, and N for [1] is a human. \n\nNow, checking the syntax: The main connective is \u2192, with F(a) as the antecedent and the rest as the consequent. The consequent is a universal quantifier over x, with Ox implying (Lx implies another universal over y...). All quantifiers are properly nested, and the logical symbols are standard. \n\nYes, this seems to be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\nF(a)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192(Lx\u2192\u2200y(Ny\u2192\u00acLy)))",

The sentence to formalize is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\" The abbreviations provided are N for human, R for chased, b for Lewis, M for donkey, P for saw, c for Hazel, and L for hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence structure. The main conditional is \"If a human chased Lewis, then [consequent].\" The consequent is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\" Let's break this down.\n\nStarting with the antecedent: \"a human chased Lewis.\" In predicate logic, this would be an existential quantifier since it's about the existence of a human. So, \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). Wait, but the wording is \"a human chased Lewis,\" which is an existential statement. So yes, \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb).\n\nNow the consequent is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So here, the \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is the A part, and \"Lewis is hungry\" is B. Therefore, the consequent would be (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Py c)) \u2192 Lb.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire statement is the antecedent implying the consequent. So the whole formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Py c) \u2192 Lb)\n\nWait, but let me check if I got the structure right. The original sentence is: If A, then (B only if C). Which translates to A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So yes, that's what I have here. A is the existence of a human chasing Lewis, B is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel,\" and C is \"Lewis is hungry.\" So B \u2192 C becomes (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Pyc)) \u2192 Lb.\n\nBut another way to look at \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acPyc). So maybe I can rephrase the consequent. However, the original structure uses \"only if,\" so sticking with the implication is correct.\n\nSo the final formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc) \u2192 Lb)\n\nI should check if there are any parentheses issues. The main connective is the implication between the antecedent and the consequent. The consequent is itself an implication. So the structure is correct.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If Alfred ate, then a human chased Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break it down into parts. The main structure seems to be a conditional: If A, then (B only if C). Let me recall that \"only if\" translates to an implication where the consequent is necessary for the antecedent. So \"B only if C\" is B \u2192 C. But here, the entire \"a human chased Lewis\" is the B part, and \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is the C part.\n\nSo the overall structure would be: If I(a) (Alfred ate), then (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) \u2192 \u00ac(\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 P(y, c))). Wait, but \"a human chased Lewis\" would involve an existential quantifier, right? Because there's some human who chased Lewis. So maybe B is \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)), and the \"only if\" makes that entire statement imply the negation of the universal about donkeys.\n\nPutting it all together: The main conditional is I(a) \u2192 [ (\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b))) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 P(y, c)) ) ].\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can sometimes be rephrased. Let me check. The original sentence says: If Alfred ate, then [H only if \u00acD], where H is \"a human chased Lewis\" and D is \"all donkeys saw Hazel\". So translating H only if \u00acD is H \u2192 \u00acD. Therefore, the entire formula is I(a) \u2192 (H \u2192 \u00acD), where H is \u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b)) and D is \u2200y (M(y) \u2192 P(y, c)).\n\nSo substituting those in, we get:\n\nI(a) \u2192 [ (\u2203x (N(x) \u2227 R(x, b))) \u2192 \u00ac(\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 P(y, c))) ) ]\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all the abbreviations are used correctly. Let me check the abbreviations again:\n\n- I: [1] ate \u2192 I(a) is \"Alfred ate\"\n- N: [1] is a human\n- R: [1] chased [2] \u2192 R(x, b) is \"x chased Lewis\"\n- b: Lewis\n- M: [1] is a donkey\n- P: [1] saw [2] \u2192 P(y, c) is \"y saw Hazel\"\n- c: Hazel\n\nYes, that seems right. Now, the formula uses the existential for \"a human\" (some human), and the universal for \"all donkeys\". The negation of the universal would be equivalent to an existential of the negation, but the original sentence says \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\", which is indeed \u00ac\u2200y (M(y) \u2192 P(y, c)).\n\nSo putting it all together, the formalization should be:\n\nIa \u2192 (\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc))\n\nI need to make sure the parentheses are correctly placed. The main implication is Ia leading to another implication. So the structure is:\n\nIa \u2192 [ ( \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) ) \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Pyc) ) ]\n\nYes, that looks correct. Also, using the abbreviations as given without any extra symbols. The quantifiers are properly used, and the connectives are in place.

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The sentence is \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" I need to translate this into predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is \"A monkey is hungry unless [condition].\" The \"unless\" here suggests that if the condition isn't met, then the monkey is hungry. In logic terms, \"A unless B\" can be translated as \"If not B, then A.\" Alternatively, it might be expressed as \"B or A.\" So, I need to represent that.\n\nThe condition here is \"every donkey chased Alfred.\" So, if every donkey chased Alfred (let's call that B), then the monkey not necessarily hungry. But if not every donkey chased Alfred (\u00acB), then the monkey is hungry (A). So the structure would be \u00acB \u2192 A. Alternatively, B \u2228 A.\n\nNow, translating each part. Let's start with \"every donkey chased Alfred.\" Using the abbreviations, M is [1] is a donkey, R is [1] chased [2], and a is Alfred. So \"every donkey chased Alfred\" would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa). That's straightforward.\n\nThen, \"A monkey is hungry\" would be \"there exists a monkey that is hungry\" or maybe \"if something is a monkey, then it is hungry.\" Wait, the original sentence is a bit ambiguous. \"A monkey is hungry...\" does that mean there exists a monkey that is hungry, or that any monkey is hungry? The example given in the problem uses \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" which becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So perhaps here, \"A monkey is hungry\" is similar to \"There exists a monkey that is hungry.\" Wait, but the structure of the original sentence is a bit different. Let me think again.\n\nThe original sentence: \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" This seems to be a general statement. So, perhaps it's saying that if it's not the case that every donkey chased Alfred, then there is a monkey that is hungry. Or maybe that if every donkey didn't chase Alfred, then some monkey is hungry. Alternatively, maybe it's that a monkey (any monkey?) is hungry unless... Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. But given the example where \"Every linguist...\" became a universal statement, maybe here \"A monkey is hungry\" is an existential statement. Because \"a monkey\" here is like \"there exists a monkey.\"\n\nSo, putting it together: The original sentence can be rephrased as \"If not every donkey chased Alfred, then there exists a monkey that is hungry.\" So, \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa)) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). Wait, but \"hungry\" is L: [1] is hungry. So for a monkey to be hungry, it's Ox (is a monkey) and Lx (is hungry). So the existence of such an x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Lx) unless... but the wording is \"A monkey is hungry\", which is more naturally an existential. For example, if the sentence was \"A monkey is in the room\", that would typically be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 In(x, room)). So I think here it's existential.\n\nSo the entire formula would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). Alternatively, since \"unless\" can be expressed as B \u2228 A, where B is \"every donkey chased Alfred\" and A is \"there is a hungry monkey\". So that would be \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2228 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). However, in logic, material implication can be used. Let me check which form is correct.\n\nIn logic, \"A unless B\" is usually translated as B \u2228 A. So here, the sentence is \"A monkey is hungry unless B\". So A is \"there is a hungry monkey\", B is \"every donkey chased Alfred\". So the formula would be \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa). But wait, the problem is that \"every donkey chased Alfred\" is a universal statement. However, in logic, when you have a disjunction between an existential and a universal, you need to make sure the scopes are correct.\n\nAlternatively, using implication: \u00acB \u2192 A. Which would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). Both forms are equivalent because in classical logic, (\u00acB \u2192 A) is equivalent to (B \u2228 A). So either form is acceptable. However, the example given uses implication in the universal case. For instance, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So perhaps the expected answer here is to use the implication form.\n\nBut the original sentence's structure is \"A unless B\", so perhaps the correct formalization is \u00acB \u2192 A. Let's confirm. Let me think of an example. Suppose \"It rains unless the sun shines.\" That would be \"If the sun doesn't shine, then it rains.\" Which is \u00acS \u2192 R, equivalent to S \u2228 R. So in our case, \"A monkey is hungry unless B\" is equivalent to \"If not B, then A\". So \u00acB \u2192 A.\n\nTherefore, the formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). Now, check if that's well-formed. The negation of the universal quantifier becomes an existential quantifier with negated implication. Wait, \u00ac\u2200x(Px \u2192 Qx) is equivalent to \u2203x(Px \u2227 \u00acQx). But in the formula, we have \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) as the antecedent. So the formula is: If there exists a donkey that did not chase Alfred, then there exists a monkey that is hungry.\n\nSo, the entire formula is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). But is that equivalent? Let me see. Because \u00ac\u2200x(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to \u2203x(A \u2227 \u00acB). So the original implication \u00ac\u2200x(...) \u2192 \u2203x(...) can be rewritten as \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). However, both forms are correct. Which one should be used? The problem says to use standard predicate logic syntax, so perhaps either is acceptable, but maybe the first form is preferable because it directly uses the negation of the universal as in the original sentence.\n\nBut looking back at the example: \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So perhaps the answer expects the use of the universal quantifier in the antecedent. Therefore, the correct formalization would be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). However, another way to write this is \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx) \u2228 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa). But I think the implication form is more direct here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 Lx). Let me check the abbreviations again. O is [1] is a monkey, L is [1] is hungry. So Ox \u2227 Lx is correct for \"x is a monkey and x is hungry.\" The existential quantifier \u2203x captures \"there is a monkey that is hungry.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa)\u2192\u2203x(Ox\u2227Lx). Let me make sure there are no typos. The connectives are \u2192, and the quantifiers are correctly placed. Also, the use of parentheses is correct. Yes. So that's the formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192Rxa)\u2192\u2203x(Ox\u2227Lx)",

So, the task is to translate the sentence \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then Hazel is hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations. Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall the abbreviations provided. R is \"[1] chased [2]\", c is Hazel, L is \"[1] is hungry\", N is \"[1] is a human\", and P is \"[1] saw [2]\". Got it.\n\nThe sentence is a conditional statement. The structure is: If A, then (B only if C). Let me parse that. The main conditional is \"If not R(c,c), then (L(c) only if \u2200 humans saw c).\" Wait, \"only if\" in logic usually translates to an implication where the consequent is necessary for the antecedent. So \"B only if C\" is equivalent to B \u2192 C. So the whole sentence would be: If \u00acR(c,c), then (L(c) \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c))).\n\nLet me check that again. The original sentence: If Hazel didn't chase Hazel (which is \u00acR(c,c)), then Hazel is hungry (Lc) only if every human saw Hazel (which is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Px,c)). So \"only if\" here means that if Hazel is hungry, then it must be the case that every human saw her. So yes, that would be Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula would be \u00acR(c,c) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c))). \n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the quantifiers. The \"every human saw Hazel\" part. The humans are all x such that Nx. So for all x, if Nx, then P(x,c). That's correct. So \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)).\n\nNow, let me check if there are any other parts. The main connective is the implication from \u00acR(c,c) to the other part. And inside that, the implication from Lc to the universal statement. \n\nI think that's right. Let me write the formula step by step. The antecedent is \u00acR(c,c). The consequent is Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c)). So combining them with \u2192, the whole thing is \u00acR(c,c) \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 P(x,c))). \n\nI should also check if there's any need for parentheses. Since implication is right-associative, but to be safe, maybe include the parentheses as I did. Also, the universal quantifier's scope should cover the entire implication Nx \u2192 P(x,c). Yes. \n\nI don't think there are any other abbreviations or parts to include. The sentence is correctly broken down into the given predicates. So the final formula should be:\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))\n\nWait, but in the abbreviations, P is [1] saw [2], so when we write P(x,c), in the formalism, it's Px c, right? So in the formula, it's Pxc. Similarly, R is [1] chased [2], so Rcc is Hazel chased Hazel. So yes, the formula would use Rcc and Pxc. \n\nSo the final translation is correct. Let me just make sure that I didn't miss any part of the original sentence. The original says \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then Hazel is hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\" So yes, that's exactly captured by the formula. The only thing left is to present it in the correct syntax with proper quantifiers and connectives.\n</think>\n\n\u00acRcc \u2192 (Lc \u2192 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 Pxc))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence to formalize is: \"If a human chased Hazel, then not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentence into its logical components. Let's break it down.\n\nThe main structure is a conditional: \"If A, then B.\" So A is \"a human chased Hazel,\" and B is \"not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\"\n\nStarting with A: \"a human chased Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, N is \"[1] is a human,\" R is \"[1] chased [2],\" and c is Hazel. So A can be expressed as \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc). There exists some x that is a human and chased Hazel.\n\nNow, B is a bit more complex: \"not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" Let's rephrase \"only if\" here. In logic, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. But here, the statement is \"not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" Let me think.\n\nLet me denote \"not all donkeys will run\" as \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy). Which is equivalent to \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acFy). So there exists a donkey that won't run.\n\nBut the \"only if\" part connects this to \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" So the entire B part is: (not all donkeys will run) only if (Alfred didn't kick Hazel). So that would translate to: (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy)) \u2192 \u00acQac. Wait, because \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" is \u00acQac (since Q is [1] kicked [2], so Alfred (a) kicked Hazel (c), so Qac; the negation is \u00acQac).\n\nBut the structure here is that the \"only if\" is reversing the implication. So \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So in this case, P is \"not all donkeys will run,\" and Q is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" Therefore, B is \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy) \u2192 \u00acQac.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire sentence is A \u2192 B, which is:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy) \u2192 \u00acQac]\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to structure B. Let me think again. The original statement is \"not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\" So \"only if\" here is setting a condition on when \"not all donkeys will run\" can happen. So if \"not all donkeys will run\" is true, then it must be that Alfred didn't kick Hazel. So yes, that's the implication: if \u00ac\u2200y..., then \u00acQac.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"only if\" is part of a more complex structure. Let's also consider that \"only if\" can sometimes be tricky. Let me make sure that the translation is correct. For example, \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. So if the antecedent is \"not all donkeys will run,\" then it's (\u00ac\u2200...) \u2192 \u00acQac.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy) \u2192 \u00acQac)\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can simplify the implication. Since P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q, but I think the nested implication is acceptable here.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if the \"only if\" is part of a biconditional, but no, \"only if\" is a one-way implication. So I think the above is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check is the scope of the quantifiers. The \"not all donkeys will run\" is \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy), which is equivalent to \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acFy). So maybe writing it as \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acFy) might be clearer, but the problem says to use the abbreviations given. Since the abbreviations for M and F are provided, we can use either form. However, the original uses \"not all donkeys will run,\" which directly translates to \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy).\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formalization would be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy) \u2192 \u00acQac)\n\nBut wait, implications can be nested. Let me check if the parentheses are correct. The main implication is from the existence of a human chasing Hazel to the implication between the donkeys not all running and Alfred not kicking Hazel. So the structure is:\n\nA \u2192 (B \u2192 C), where A is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc), B is \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy), and C is \u00acQac.\n\nAlternatively, using logical equivalences, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But the problem says to use standard syntax, so either form is acceptable. However, since the original sentence uses \"only if,\" which translates directly to an implication, I think keeping it as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the \"only if\" is part of the consequent of the main conditional. So the entire structure is correct.\n\nLet me double-check each part:\n\n- \"a human chased Hazel\" \u2192 \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc)\n- \"not all donkeys will run\" \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy)\n- \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" \u2192 \u00acQac\n- \"not all donkeys will run only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy) \u2192 \u00acQac\n- Therefore, the whole sentence: \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy) \u2192 \u00acQac]\n\nYes, that seems right. Now, let me check if there are any other possible interpretations. For example, could the \"only if\" be part of a different structure? Suppose someone misreads it as \"not (all donkeys will run only if Alfred kicked Hazel)\" but that's not the case here. The original is \"not all donkeys will run only if...\" So the \"only if\" applies to the entire \"not all donkeys will run\" being conditional on Alfred not kicking Hazel.\n\nAnother possible mistake is confusing the direction of the implication. Since \"only if\" is P \u2192 Q, where P is the statement before \"only if\" and Q is after. So here, P is \"not all donkeys will run,\" Q is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel,\" so P \u2192 Q. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final formula should be:\n\n\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxc) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Fy) \u2192 \u00acQac)\n\nI need to make sure that the quantifiers are properly scoped. Also, the variables x and y are distinct, which they are here. So this should be a well-formed formula.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxc)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Fy)\u2192\u00acQac)",

It's a conditional statement: If [A], then [B]. So the main connective will be an implication (\u2192).\n\nBreaking down the parts:\n\nA: \"Every monkey saw Hazel.\" Using the abbreviations, O is \"[1] is a monkey\" and P is \"[1] saw [2]\". Hazel is represented by c. So for A, it should be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc). That's straightforward, similar to the example given.\n\nNow, the consequent is \"B: Alfred saw Alfred only if no donkeys ate.\" The \"only if\" here is a bit tricky. In logic, \"Q only if R\" translates to Q \u2192 R. So here, Q is \"Alfred saw Alfred\" and R is \"no donkeys ate.\"\n\nLet's handle Q first. Alfred is a, so \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is Paa.\n\nR is \"no donkeys ate.\" The abbreviation M is \"[1] is a donkey\" and I is \"[1] ate.\" So \"no donkeys ate\" would be \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix).

Since the negation is on the existence, maybe \u00ac\u2203x... is better here.\n\nPutting B together: Paa \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix). Alternatively, Paa \u2192 \u2200x (Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Both are logically equivalent, but perhaps the first is more direct given the wording \"no donkeys ate.\"\n\nSo the entire implication is: [\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)] \u2192 [Paa \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix)].\n\nWait, but in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Let me make sure the parentheses are correct. The main structure is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C), which is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But here, the original sentence is \"If A, then (B only if C)\", which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). So the formalization should be as I wrote.\n\nLet me check again. The consequent is \"Alfred saw Alfred only if no donkeys ate.\" So that's Paa \u2192 (no donkeys ate). Therefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Paa \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nAlternatively, using the universal quantifier for the donkeys: \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix) is equivalent to \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Maybe the problem expects one or the other. Let me think. The abbreviation for \"no donkeys ate\" would be the negation of \"some donkey ate,\" which is \u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). So the correct translation is \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). So that part is correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc) \u2192 (Paa \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can write this as:\n\n(\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Pxc)) \u2192 (Paa \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x (Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nWhich is a well-formed formula. Alternatively, since implications are right-associative, maybe we can omit some parentheses, but to be safe, I'll include them.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any other possible interpretations? For example, could \"only if\" be part of a biconditional? No, because \"only if\" is a one-way implication. So Q only if R is Q \u2192 R, not Q \u2194 R.\n\nSo the final formula should be:\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxc) \u2192 (Paa\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Ix))\n\nI need to make sure that all abbreviations are used correctly. O for monkey, P for saw, c for Hazel, a for Alfred, M for donkey, I for ate. Yes, that's all covered.\n\nAlso, check that there are no free variables. All variables are quantified. The x in \u2200x is bound, the x in \u00ac\u2203x is bound. The a and c are constants. So that's good.\n\nTherefore, the formalization is correct.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Pxc)\u2192(Paa\u2192\u00ac\u2203x(Mx\u2227Ix))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the sentence is: \"If every monkey chased Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis.\" And the abbreviations are O for being a monkey, R for chased, b for Lewis, and Q for kicked. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B], where A is \"every monkey chased Lewis\" and B is \"every monkey kicked Lewis.\" \n\nStarting with the antecedent (A): \"Every monkey chased Lewis.\" In predicate logic, \"every monkey\" would be a universal quantifier over all x where O(x) is true. So, \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb), because R is [1] chased [2], so the first argument is x (the monkey) and the second is b (Lewis).\n\nThen the consequent (B): \"Every monkey kicked Lewis.\" Similarly, this would be \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb), since Q is [1] kicked [2], so again x (monkey) and b (Lewis).\n\nPutting them together with the conditional, the entire formula should be: If the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true. So, the structure is (Antecedent) \u2192 (Consequent). \n\nTherefore, combining them, it's \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). Wait, but do I need to use the same variable x in both parts? Well, since they're separate universal statements, the variable is just a bound variable, so using x in both is acceptable. The quantifiers are separate, so each x is bound in their respective universals.\n\nLet me check if there's any other way. Suppose someone might think that maybe the same x in both parts, but no, the antecedent is a universal statement and the consequent is another universal. So the correct formalization would be the implication between the two universal statements.\n\nSo the final formula should be: \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nWait, but maybe I should use different variables for each quantifier? Like \u2200x and \u2200y? But in predicate logic, when you have separate quantifiers, the variable name doesn't matter as long as they are bound correctly. So \u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb) is about all monkeys chasing Lewis, and then the consequent is another universal. So the formula is correct as written. \n\nAnother thing to check: are there any implicit connections between the actions? For example, does the same monkey that chased also kick? Well, the original sentence says \"if every monkey chased..., then every monkey kicked...\" So it's a general statement: if all monkeys did X, then all monkeys did Y. So the formalization is correct. \n\nSo I think that's it. The final formula is the implication between the two universal statements. So written as (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Rxb)) \u2192 (\u2200x (Ox \u2192 Qxb)). Using the abbreviations provided and the logical symbols as specified. No need for parentheses around the implication unless necessary, but since the antecedent and consequent are each universal quantified statements, the parentheses help clarify. But in standard syntax, maybe the arrows have lower precedence, so parentheses might be needed. Wait, in standard logic notation, the implication has lower precedence than the quantifiers, so \u2200x ... \u2192 \u2200x ... is parsed as (\u2200x ...) \u2192 (\u2200x ...). So maybe parentheses aren't strictly necessary, but including them makes it unambiguous. The example given in the problem includes parentheses, like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), so perhaps the user expects parentheses around each quantified formula. \n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be: \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Rxb) \u2192 \u2200x(Ox \u2192 Qxb). \n\nYes, that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any of the abbreviations. O is monkey, R is chased, Q is kicked, b is Lewis. Yep, all correct. The antecedent uses R and the consequent uses Q, and both refer to Lewis as b. Looks good.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Ox\u2192Rxb)\u2192\u2200x(Ox\u2192Qxb)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then no humans are hungry only if no donkeys ate.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The main structure is a conditional: If P, then Q. Here, P is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel,\" and Q is \"no humans are hungry only if no donkeys ate.\" Wait, the \"only if\" part might be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is usually translated as A \u2192 B. But here, the whole Q is \"no humans are hungry only if no donkeys ate.\" Let me think.\n\nThe phrase \"no humans are hungry\" would be \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx), since N is \"is a human\" and L is \"is hungry.\" Similarly, \"no donkeys ate\" would be \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix), where M is \"is a donkey\" and I is \"ate.\"\n\nSo the \"only if\" part: \"no humans are hungry only if no donkeys ate\" would translate to (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)). Because \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Wait, no, actually, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. So if the statement is \"A only if B,\" then it's A \u2192 B. But here, the structure is \"no humans are hungry only if no donkeys ate,\" so A is \"no humans are hungry\" and B is \"no donkeys ate.\" Therefore, it's (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)).\n\nBut the original sentence says \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then [this implication].\" So the entire formula would be: \u00acQ(a, c) \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)) ].\n\nWait, Q is \"[1] kicked [2]\", so Q(a,c) is \"Alfred kicked Hazel.\" The negation is \u00acQ(a,c), which is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The entire statement is \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 [ (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)) ].\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can write this as \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)).\n\nBut maybe we can simplify the inner implication. Also, note that in logic, A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So perhaps we can write it as (\u00acQ(a,c) \u2227 \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix). But the original structure is an implication where the consequent is another implication. However, the problem says to use the standard syntax, so probably keeping it as \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)) is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can rephrase the inner part. Let me check the original sentence again: \"no humans are hungry only if no donkeys ate.\" So \"only if\" here is making the \"no donkeys ate\" a necessary condition for \"no humans are hungry.\" Which again translates to the implication that if there are no hungry humans, then no donkeys ate. So that's the same as before.\n\nNow, let's make sure about the abbreviations:\n\n- Q: [1] kicked [2], so Q(a,c) is Alfred kicked Hazel. The negation is \u00acQ(a,c).\n\n- N: human, L: hungry. So \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) is \"there does not exist a human that is hungry,\" i.e., no humans are hungry.\n\n- M: donkey, I: ate. So \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix) is \"no donkeys ate.\"\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe entire formula is \u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix)).\n\nBut in predicate logic, implications can be written with the arrows. So the final formula would be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nBut I need to check if there's any quantifier scope issues. The variables in the inner implications are bound by their own existential quantifiers. So this should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use universal quantifiers. Wait, \"no humans are hungry\" can also be written as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Similarly, \"no donkeys ate\" is \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). Let me check if that's equivalent. Yes, because \u00ac\u2203x(Px) is equivalent to \u2200x(\u00acPx). But here, we have \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx), which is equivalent to \u2200x(\u00ac(Nx \u2227 Lx)) which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Similarly for the donkeys. So maybe using universal quantifiers would be better for clarity, but the problem allows any correct formalization as long as it's well-formed. However, the example given uses existential quantifiers (in the example, \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), so perhaps both forms are acceptable. Let me see which is more appropriate here.\n\nThe original instruction says to use the standard predicate logic syntax. Either form is acceptable. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nOriginal approach with existential negation:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 (\u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix))\n\nAlternatively, using universal quantifiers:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) ) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) ) )\n\nBut the problem didn't specify to use universal or existential, just to use the abbreviations given. The abbreviations for N, L, M, I are given, so both approaches are possible. However, the example uses a universal quantifier (\u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc)), so perhaps the expected answer uses universal quantifiers where applicable. Let me think which is more straightforward.\n\nBut the inner part is \"no humans are hungry\", which can be written as \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Similarly for the donkeys. So maybe the correct formalization would use these universal forms. Let me adjust.\n\nSo then, the inner implication would be ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) ) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is \u00acQac \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nBut again, the structure is an implication inside another implication. So the final formula would be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nAlternatively, since implications can be nested, this is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to simplify this. Let me recall that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So applying that here, the entire formula could be rewritten as (\u00acQac \u2227 \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx). However, the original sentence structure uses \"if... then...\" with the consequent being an \"only if\" statement. So the original structure is more naturally expressed as the nested implication. However, both forms are logically equivalent. But since the problem asks for a single well-formed formula, either form is acceptable. But which one is expected?\n\nLooking back at the example, they used a universal quantifier for \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" as \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So perhaps using universal quantifiers here would be more in line with the example.\n\nSo let's proceed with the universal quantifiers.\n\nTherefore, the formalization would be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nBut how to write this in the required syntax? Let's make sure about the parentheses. The main connective is the implication \u00acQac \u2192 [ ... ].\n\nInside the [ ... ] is another implication: \u2200x(...) \u2192 \u2200x(...).\n\nSo the entire formula is:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) ) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) ) )\n\nWhich in symbols would be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the existential forms, it would be:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( \u00ac\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Lx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ix) )\n\nBut which is better? The problem says to use the abbreviations provided. The abbreviations for N, L, M, I are given as predicates. Either approach is acceptable. However, since the example uses universal quantifiers for \"every linguist\", perhaps using universal quantifiers here is better. But I need to check if the problem expects one or the other. Since both are correct, but the example uses universal for a universal statement, maybe that's preferred.\n\nBut let's check the original sentence again. The \"no humans are hungry\" is equivalent to \"all humans are not hungry\", which is \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx). Similarly for donkeys. So using the universal quantifier here is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is:\n\n\u00acQ(a,c) \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nNow, translating that into symbols with the correct abbreviations and syntax:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nWhich is the required formula.\n\nI need to make sure that all the variables are properly quantified. Each \u2200x is binding its own variable. Since there are two universal quantifiers, each with their own x. But in predicate logic, variables can be reused as long as they are bound. However, to avoid confusion, sometimes people use different variables, but it's not necessary. For example, the first \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) and the second \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) can both use x as their bound variable because they are in separate scopes. So this is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\u00acQac \u2192 ( \u2200x(Nx \u2192 \u00acLx) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acIx) )\n\nBut let me check again the original sentence. The structure is: If not Q(a,c), then (no humans are hungry only if no donkeys ate). The \"only if\" translates to the implication that if no humans are hungry, then no donkeys ate. So the consequent is (no H \u2192 no D). Therefore, the entire implication is \u00acQ \u2192 (A \u2192 B), which is what I have.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final formula should be as above.\n</think>\n\n\u00acQac\u2192(\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acLx)\u2192\u2200x(Mx\u2192\u00acIx))",

        "response": {
            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this translation step by step. First, I need to parse the English sentence carefully: \"If every human is asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Alfred will run.\" The abbreviations provided are N for human, J for asleep, M for donkey, P for saw, c for Hazel, F for will run, and a for Alfred.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"If every human is asleep.\" That translates to a universal quantifier. So, \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx). That's straightforward.\n\nNow the main structure is a conditional: If [A], then [B]. So, the entire formula will start with \u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 ... Now, what's the consequent here?\n\nThe consequent is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Alfred will run.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" is typically translated as A \u2192 B. So, if we have \"A only if B,\" it's A implies B. But here, the \"A\" part is \"all donkeys saw Hazel,\" and the \"B\" part is \"Alfred will run.\" Wait, but the original says \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Alfred will run.\" So, maybe rephrasing: \"If Alfred will run, then not all donkeys saw Hazel.\" Wait, no. Because \"only if\" reverses the direction. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal statement: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Alfred will run.\" Let me parse this. Let me consider the structure. Let's denote:\n\nLet me think of it as: (Not all donkeys saw Hazel) only if (Alfred will run). So, \"only if\" here connects the two parts. So, the structure would be: (Not all donkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (Alfred will run). Because \"A only if B\" is A \u2192 B. Wait, no, actually, \"A only if B\" is equivalent to A \u2192 B. For example, \"I will go only if it is sunny\" translates to \"If I go, then it is sunny.\" So, in this case, the \"A\" is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel,\" and the \"B\" is \"Alfred will run.\" Therefore, the statement would be: (Not all donkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (F a). Wait, but the original says \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Alfred will run.\" So, that would be \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Alfred will run\"? Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I have the direction reversed. Let me recall: \"A only if B\" means that A can only happen if B happens. So, it's equivalent to A \u2192 B. For example, \"You can have dessert only if you finish your dinner\" translates to \"If you have dessert, then you finished your dinner.\" So applying that here: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is A, and \"Alfred will run\" is B. Therefore, the statement is A \u2192 B. So, (Not all donkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (Alfred will run). But the original sentence is phrased as \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Alfred will run.\" So, that would be: (Not all donkeys saw Hazel) only if (Alfred will run), which translates to (Not all donkeys saw Hazel) \u2192 (Alfred will run). So that's correct.\n\nNow, what's \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\"? The negation of \"all donkeys saw Hazel.\" The statement \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would be \u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)). Therefore, \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)), which is equivalent to \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x, c)).\n\nSo putting that together, the consequent of the main conditional is: [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c))] \u2192 F a.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 [\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)) \u2192 F a]\n\nBut wait, in logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, we can write it as:\n\n\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)) \u2192 F a)\n\nBut we need to make sure the parentheses are correct. Let me check again. The main connective is the implication between the two parts. The antecedent is \u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx), and the consequent is (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)) \u2192 F a). So the entire formula is:\n\n(\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)) \u2192 F a)\n\nAlternatively, since implications are right-associative, but to be safe, I'll include all necessary parentheses.\n\nBut maybe we can simplify the consequent. Let's recall that \u00ac\u2200x (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to \u2203x (A \u2227 \u00acB). So perhaps writing it as \u2203x (Mx \u2227 \u00acP(x, c)) \u2192 F a. Let me see. The original consequent is \"not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Alfred will run.\" So whether we use the negated universal or the existential, both are equivalent. But since the problem says to use the abbreviations given, perhaps we should stick with the negated universal. However, the problem allows using standard logical symbols, so both are acceptable. But maybe the problem expects the negated universal. Let me check the example. In the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is translated as \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So they used the universal. So perhaps here, using the negated universal is better. So the consequent is \u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)) \u2192 F a.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2200x (Nx \u2192 Jx) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x (Mx \u2192 P(x, c)) \u2192 F a)\n\nBut let me check if there's any variable conflict. The first part uses x, the second part also uses x. But in predicate logic, variables are bound by their quantifiers. So the x in the first \u2200x is separate from the x in the second \u2200x. However, in practice, when writing, we can use the same variable since they are in different scopes. So that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, maybe the second quantifier could use a different variable, but the problem allows using the same variable as long as it's properly bound. So the formula is correct as written.\n\nSo the final formalization is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c)) \u2192 Fa)\n\nBut I need to make sure about the parentheses. Let me check again. The main implication is between the first universal and the implication of the consequent. So the structure is:\n\n(A \u2192 (B \u2192 C))\n\nWhich is equivalent to (A \u2192 B \u2192 C) if written without parentheses, but since implication is right-associative, but to be explicit, parentheses are needed. However, in standard notation, multiple implications are right-associative, so A \u2192 B \u2192 C is parsed as A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Therefore, in the formula, it's acceptable to write:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c)) \u2192 Fa\n\nBut to make it unambiguous, perhaps adding parentheses around the inner implication. However, the example given in the problem uses no parentheses for the implication, like \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc). So perhaps the expected answer is to have the implications without unnecessary parentheses, assuming standard precedence.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps the correct way is to write:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c)) \u2192 Fa)\n\nBut the problem says to return a single well-formed formula. So including the parentheses around the inner implication is necessary for clarity. However, in standard notation, implications associate to the right, so the parentheses can be omitted. Let me verify with the example. The example's formalization is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is a universal quantifier followed by an implication. So in our case, the main formula is an implication where the antecedent is \u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) and the consequent is another implication. So the structure is (A \u2192 (B \u2192 C)), which can be written as A \u2192 B \u2192 C if we follow right associativity. Therefore, the correct formula is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c)) \u2192 Fa\n\nBut I need to check if that's acceptable. However, in some logical notations, multiple implications require parentheses. To avoid ambiguity, perhaps including the parentheses is better. However, the example doesn't have parentheses for the implication, so maybe the answer should follow that style. Let me think again. The example is \u2200x(Lx\u2192Rxc), which is a universal quantifier with an implication in the scope. The main connective is the implication inside the quantifier. In our case, the main connective is an implication between two parts. The first part is a universal, the second part is an implication. So the entire formula is an implication where the antecedent is \u2200x... and the consequent is \u00ac\u2200x... \u2192 Fa. Therefore, to write it correctly, we need to enclose the consequent in parentheses if we don't use the right associativity. Since the example doesn't have parentheses for the implication inside the quantifier, perhaps we can assume that right associativity is acceptable here. Therefore, the formula can be written as:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c)) \u2192 Fa\n\nBut I need to make sure that the order is correct. The main implication is between the first part and the second implication. So without parentheses, it's parsed as \u2200x... \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200... \u2192 Fa). Which is what we want. Therefore, the formula is correct as written.\n\nAnother thing to check: the abbreviations. The saw relation is P, with two arguments. In the example, R is \"[1] admires [2]\" and the formalization uses Rxc, which is correct. So here, P(x,c) is correct for \"[x] saw [c]\".\n\nSo putting it all together, the final answer is:\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c))\u2192Fa)\n\nBut to make sure there are no typos, let me recheck:\n\n- N is [1] is a human: Nx\n- J is [1] is asleep: Jx\n- M is [1] is a donkey: Mx\n- P is [1] saw [2]: P(x, c) where c is Hazel\n- F is [1] will run: Fa for Alfred.\n\nYes, that's all correct. The structure is:\n\nIf (all humans are asleep), then (if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Alfred will run).\n\nWhich translates to the formula as above. So I think that's the correct translation.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x(Nx\u2192Jx)\u2192(\u00ac\u2200x(Mx\u2192P(x,c))\u2192Fa)",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The sentence is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless Hazel will attack.\" I need to translate this into formal predicate logic using the given abbreviations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence. The key parts are \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" and \"unless Hazel will attack.\" The word \"unless\" usually translates to a logical implication. In English, \"A unless B\" can be interpreted as \"If not B, then A\" or equivalently \"B or A.\" But I need to be careful with the negations here.\n\nThe original sentence says that Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless Hazel attacks. So, if Hazel doesn't attack, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis. Alternatively, Alfred sees Lewis only if Hazel attacks. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nLet me recall that \"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" but sometimes with a nuance of \"if not B, then A.\" So in this case, \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" (which is \u00acP(a,b)) unless \"Hazel will attack\" (G(c)). So the structure would be: If not G(c), then \u00acP(a,b). Which is equivalent to G(c) \u2228 \u00acP(a,b). But the original statement is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless Hazel will attack,\" so the negation is on the seeing part.\n\nWait, let me break it down. The phrase \"A unless B\" is often translated as \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" So here, \"A\" is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" (\u00acP(a,b)), and \"B\" is \"Hazel will attack\" (G(c)). So substituting, we get \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). Which is the same as \"If Hazel does not attack, then Alfred does not see Lewis.\"\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as the contrapositive: P(a,b) \u2192 G(c). That is, if Alfred does see Lewis, then Hazel will attack. Both forms are logically equivalent, but which one is more appropriate here?\n\nThe problem is to use the abbreviations provided. Let's check the abbreviations again:\n\n- P: [1] saw [2]. So P(a,b) would be \"Alfred saw Lewis.\" But the original sentence uses \"doesn't see,\" so it's about not seeing. The tense here is present, but the abbreviation P uses \"saw\" which is past tense. Wait, the sentence says \"doesn't see,\" present tense, but the abbreviation is \"saw,\" past tense. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or maybe we just use P regardless. The user probably expects us to use P as the predicate regardless of tense. So we'll take P(a,b) as \"Alfred sees Lewis,\" even though the abbreviation says \"saw.\" Maybe it's a mistake, but we have to follow the given abbreviations. So assuming that P is the correct predicate for \"sees,\" even if the abbreviation says \"saw.\"\n\nSo, proceeding with that. The sentence is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless Hazel will attack.\" So the main structure is \"\u00acP(a,b) unless G(c).\" Translating \"unless\" as \"if not,\" we get \"If not G(c), then \u00acP(a,b).\" Which is \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). Alternatively, contrapositive: P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nWhich one is better? Both are correct. Let me check if there's a standard way to translate \"unless.\" Typically, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B\" but with some nuances. However, in logic, \"A unless B\" is often formalized as \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" So in this case, \"\u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b).\" But another way is \"P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\" Both are equivalent via contraposition.\n\nNow, the question is whether the original sentence is more naturally captured by one or the other. The original sentence says that the only way Alfred can see Lewis is if Hazel attacks. So it's stating that seeing Lewis requires Hazel attacking. So that would be P(a,b) \u2192 G(c). Because if he does see Lewis, then Hazel must have attacked. Alternatively, if Hazel doesn't attack, he doesn't see Lewis. Either way is acceptable.\n\nBut let's check the wording. The original is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless Hazel will attack.\" So the \"unless\" introduces a condition that must be met for the opposite to happen. So, \"unless B\" means \"if not B, then not A.\" Wait, if the structure is \"not A unless B,\" which would be \"\u00acA unless B,\" which is equivalent to \"if not B, then \u00acA.\" So yes, that would be \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. In this case, A is \"Alfred sees Lewis,\" so \u00acA is \u00acP(a,b). Therefore, the formula is \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b).\n\nAlternatively, since \"unless\" can be tricky, maybe I should think of it as \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B.\" So here, \"\u00acP(a,b) unless G(c)\" would be \"\u00acP(a,b) \u2228 G(c).\" Which is equivalent to both of the previous statements. However, in predicate logic, we usually prefer to use implications rather than disjunctions when possible, but it's acceptable either way.\n\nBut the problem is to use the standard logical symbols. So which form is more appropriate? The example given in the problem uses an implication with a universal quantifier. Since there are no quantifiers here (the sentence is about specific individuals: Alfred, Lewis, Hazel), we don't need to use \u2200 or \u2203. So the formula would be a simple implication or disjunction.\n\nThe user's example uses implication, so maybe following that style. Let's go with the implication form. So the correct translation would be \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). Alternatively, P(a,b) \u2192 G(c). Both are correct, but which one is more direct?\n\nThe original sentence is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless Hazel will attack.\" So \"unless\" here is acting as a condition for the negation. So if the condition (Hazel attacking) is not met, then the negation (Alfred doesn't see) holds. Therefore, \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b).\n\nAlternatively, if we use the contrapositive, P(a,b) \u2192 G(c), which is logically equivalent. But the example given in the problem uses implication in the direction of the antecedent being the condition. For example, in the example \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" becomes \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the structure is \"if Lx then Rxc.\" Similarly, here, if we take \"unless\" as \"if not B then A,\" then it's \u00acB \u2192 A. So in this case, \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b).\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization would be \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b).\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's take an example. Suppose Hazel does not attack (\u00acG(c)), then according to the implication, Alfred doesn't see Lewis (\u00acP(a,b)). Which matches the original statement. If Hazel does attack (G(c)), then the implication doesn't say anything about whether Alfred sees Lewis or not. But the original sentence says that Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless Hazel attacks. Which means that if Hazel does attack, then Alfred might see Lewis. But the original statement is that the only time Alfred can see Lewis is when Hazel attacks. So if Hazel attacks, then Alfred could see Lewis, but it's not guaranteed. The original statement is a necessary condition: for Alfred to see Lewis, Hazel must attack. So the necessary condition is that G(c) is necessary for P(a,b). Which is formalized as P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nBut the original statement is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless Hazel will attack.\" So \"unless\" here is saying that the only way Alfred can see Lewis is if Hazel attacks. So the seeing requires the attack. Therefore, the correct formalization is P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nBut earlier, I thought that \"A unless B\" is \u00acB \u2192 A. But in this case, the original is \"\u00acA unless B,\" which would be \"if not B, then \u00acA,\" which is equivalent to \"B \u2228 \u00acA,\" which is equivalent to \"\u00acA \u2228 B,\" which is equivalent to \"A \u2192 B.\" So if we have \"\u00acA unless B,\" that translates to \"A \u2192 B.\" Therefore, in this case, the original sentence is \"\u00acP(a,b) unless G(c),\" which would be P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nAh, that's a key point. Let me re-express this. The structure is \"\u00acA unless B.\" Which is equivalent to \"if not B, then \u00acA,\" which is equivalent to \"A \u2192 B.\" Therefore, the correct translation is P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nSo why did I get confused earlier? Because I was thinking of \"A unless B\" as \"\u00acB \u2192 A,\" but in this case, the original is \"\u00acA unless B,\" which would be \"if not B, then \u00acA,\" which is equivalent to \"B \u2228 \u00acA,\" which is the same as \"A \u2192 B.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nLet me verify this with an example. Suppose Alfred does see Lewis (P(a,b) is true). Then according to the implication, G(c) must be true. Which matches the original statement: if he does see Lewis, then Hazel must have attacked. Which is correct. Conversely, if Hazel doesn't attack (\u00acG(c)), then the contrapositive would be \u00acP(a,b), which is also correct. So both forms are valid, but depending on how you structure the translation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is P(a,b) \u2192 G(c). Alternatively, \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). Both are logically equivalent. However, which one is expected here?\n\nThe example given in the problem uses the implication in the direction where the antecedent is the condition leading to the consequent. For instance, in the example, \"Every linguist admires Charlie\" is \u2200x(Lx \u2192 Rxc). So the structure is Lx implies Rxc. Similarly, if we follow that pattern, perhaps the intended answer is \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b). But I need to check the exact wording of the original sentence.\n\nThe original sentence is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless Hazel will attack.\" So the structure is \"\u00acA unless B.\" As discussed, this is equivalent to \"A \u2192 B.\" Therefore, P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nBut maybe the user expects the translation using the \"unless\" as \"if not,\" leading to \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. Let's see. If we take \"unless\" as \"if not,\" then \"A unless B\" is \"if not B, then A.\" But here, the sentence is \"\u00acA unless B,\" which would be \"if not B, then \u00acA.\" So \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. Which would be \u00acG(c) \u2192 \u00acP(a,b).\n\nBut according to the logical equivalence, \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"A \u2228 B,\" which is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 A.\" So if the original is \"\u00acA unless B,\" then that would be \"\u00acA \u2228 B,\" which is equivalent to \"A \u2192 B.\" Therefore, the correct translation is P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nBut to confirm, let's take an example. Suppose Hazel does not attack (\u00acG(c)). Then according to P(a,b) \u2192 G(c), if P(a,b) were true, then G(c) would have to be true, but since G(c) is false, P(a,b) must be false. Therefore, \u00acP(a,b). Which matches the original statement. Conversely, if Hazel does attack (G(c)), then P(a,b) could be true or false; the implication doesn't restrict it. Which is correct, because the original statement only says that if Hazel doesn't attack, then Alfred doesn't see. It doesn't say anything about when Hazel does attack.\n\nTherefore, both forms are correct, but depending on how you structure the translation. However, since the problem is about translating \"unless,\" and given that \"A unless B\" is \u00acB \u2192 A, but here we have \"\u00acA unless B,\" which is B \u2228 \u00acA, which is A \u2192 B. Therefore, the correct formalization is P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n\nSo the final answer is P(a,b) \u2192 G(c).\n</think>\n\nPab\u2192Gc",

The sentence is: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the structure. The main conditional here is \"If a human chased Lewis, then [something].\" The \"something\" is a bit complex: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: \"a human chased Lewis.\" Using the abbreviations, N is \"[1] is a human\" and R is \"[1] chased [2]\". So \"a human chased Lewis\" would be \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb), since b is Lewis.\n\nNow the second part: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\" The phrase \"only if\" can be tricky. In logic, \"A only if B\" translates to A \u2192 B. So here, the antecedent is \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis,\" which is \u00acP(a, b) since P is \"[1] saw [2]\" and a is Alfred, b is Lewis. The consequent is \"a human chased Hazel,\" which would be \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryc), because c is Hazel.\n\nPutting that together, the \"only if\" part becomes \u00acPab \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryc). \n\nNow the entire sentence is: If [\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)], then [\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203y (Ny \u2227 Ryc)]. So the whole formula is \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ryc)).\n\nWait, but in logic, implications can be nested. Let me check if I need to use parentheses properly. The main connective is the implication between the first part and the second. The second part itself is an implication. So the structure is correct as written. Also, since the quantifiers are in the right places, this should be the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2200x((Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acPab \u2192 \u2203y(Ny \u2227 Ryc)))",

            "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to translate this sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is a bit complex: \"If a human chased Lewis, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break it down. The main structure seems to be a conditional statement: \"If A, then B only if C.\" Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The original sentence is \"If a human chased Lewis, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" \n\nSo the structure is: If H (a human chased Lewis), then (Lewis didn't chase Lewis) only if (not all donkeys kicked Alfred). Hmm. The \"only if\" here is tricky. Normally, \"P only if Q\" translates to P \u2192 Q. But here it's part of a larger conditional. Let me rephrase the entire sentence for clarity.\n\nThe sentence can be rephrased as: If there exists a human who chased Lewis, then the fact that Lewis didn't chase himself is only if it's not the case that all donkeys kicked Alfred. Wait, maybe I should look at the structure step by step.\n\nFirst, the main conditional is \"If a human chased Lewis...\" So that's an existential quantifier: \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb). Because \"a human\" implies existence, right? So N is \"is a human\", R is \"chased\", and b is Lewis. So the antecedent is \u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb).\n\nThen the consequent is \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" Let's parse this part. The phrase \"P only if Q\" is P \u2192 Q. So here, P is \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\", which is \u00acRbb. And Q is \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\", which is \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qya). Alternatively, that's equivalent to \u2203y (My \u2227 \u00acQya). But since the original uses \"not all\", maybe it's better to keep it as \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qya).\n\nSo putting that together, the consequent is \u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qya). Wait, but the structure is \"only if\", so if we have \"P only if Q\", then it's P \u2192 Q. So in this case, the P is \u00acRbb, and the Q is \u00ac\u2200... So the consequent is \u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qya). Therefore, the entire implication is:\n\n[\u2203x (Nx \u2227 Rxb)] \u2192 [\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y (My \u2192 Qya)]\n\nBut in logic, implications can be nested. Alternatively, this can be rewritten using material implication. Also, note that A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. So maybe that's a way to simplify it. Let me check:\n\nOriginal: If A, then (B \u2192 C). Which is A \u2192 (B \u2192 C). Which is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But depending on how the original is structured, perhaps that's the way to go. However, the problem is to formalize it as given, so maybe we should stick to the original structure.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the abbreviations again. The abbreviations given are:\n\nN: [1] is a human  \nR: [1] chased [2]  \nb: Lewis  \nM: [1] is a donkey  \nQ: [1] kicked [2]  \na: Alfred\n\nSo the sentence is: If a human chased Lewis (i.e., \u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb)), then (Lewis didn't chase Lewis) only if (not all donkeys kicked Alfred). \n\nSo the \"only if\" part is between \u00acRbb and \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qya). So the consequent is \u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qya). Therefore, the entire formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qya))\n\nBut in predicate logic, we can write that directly. Let me check if there's any other part to consider. \n\nWait, another way to look at \"only if\" is that the entire consequent is structured as a conditional. So the main implication is from the antecedent (human chased Lewis) to the consequent, which is itself a conditional (Lewis didn't chase himself only if ...). So the structure is correct as written.\n\nTherefore, the formalization should be:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qya))\n\nAlternatively, we can rephrase the implication using the equivalence A \u2192 (B \u2192 C) \u2261 (A \u2227 B) \u2192 C. But unless the problem requires minimal connectives, it's probably acceptable to leave it as nested implications.\n\nAnother thing to check: the \"only if\" part. The original says \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" So that's \u00acRbb only if \u00ac\u2200... So yes, \u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200... So that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\n\u2203x(Nx \u2227 Rxb) \u2192 (\u00acRbb \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y(My \u2192 Qya))\n\nNow, let's make sure that all abbreviations are used correctly. N for human, R for chased, b for Lewis, M for donkey, Q for kicked, a for Alfred. Yes, that's all covered here. Quantifiers are properly used: \u2203x for the human, \u2200y for all donkeys. The connectives are implication and negation. \n\nI think that's the correct formalization.\n</think>\n\n\u2203x(Nx\u2227Rxb)\u2192(\u00acRbb\u2192\u00ac\u2200y(My\u2192Qya))",
