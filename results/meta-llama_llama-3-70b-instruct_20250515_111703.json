Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\nThis means that there are three distinct categories: toves, borogoves, and raths, and every object is one of these.\n\n2. Every borogove is uffish.\nThis implies that all borogoves have the property of being uffish.\n\n3. If Bungo snicker-snacked Bungo, then Zindle is beamish only if not all borogoves are beamish.\nThis statement is a bit tricky. It implies that if Bungo snicker-snacked Bungo, then Zindle's beamishness is dependent on not all borogoves being beamish. If all borogoves were beamish, then Zindle would not be beamish.\n\n4. No raths will burble or every borogove is beamish.\nThis statement presents a dichotomy: either no raths burble, or every borogove is beamish.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\n1. Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle if and only if every borogove is beamish.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. We don't have any information about the relationship between raths snicker-snacking Zindle and borogoves being beamish.\n\n2. No borogoves are uffish.\nThis statement is false, since we know that every borogove is uffish (statement 2).\n\n3. Not all borogoves are uffish.\nThis statement is also false, since we know that every borogove is uffish (statement 2).\n\n4. No borogoves are uffish if and only if not all borogoves are uffish.\nThis statement is a tautology, but it's not necessarily true in this situation, since we know that every borogove is uffish.\n\n5. Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle if and only if no borogoves are uffish.\nThis statement is also false, since we know that every borogove is uffish.\n\n6. Only borogoves are uffish.\nThis statement is true. We know that every borogove is uffish, and there's no information suggesting that toves or raths can be uffish.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n6. Only borogoves are uffish.",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n\nThis statement sets the stage for the problem. We have three categories: toves, borogoves, and raths. Each entity belongs to one and only one category, and there is at least one entity in each category.\n\n2. If Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo, then not all toves chortled at Bungo only if Bungo didn't chortle at Rafin.\n\nThis statement is a bit convoluted, but we can simplify it by considering two cases:\n\na. Rafin galumphed over Bungo: In this case, the statement doesn't provide any new information.\nb. Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo: Then, not all toves chortled at Bungo only if Bungo didn't chortle at Rafin. This means that if Bungo chortled at Rafin, then all toves must chortle at Bungo.\n\n3.

If Rafin is not a tove, then no tove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n4. Only raths are mimsy and every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n\nThis statement tells us two things:\n\na. Only raths are mimsy: This means that no toves or borogoves are mimsy.\nb. Every tove galumphed over Rafin: This implies that Rafin is not a tove, because if Rafin were a tove, it would galumph over itself, which is not possible.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n1. No raths chortled at Bungo if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nWe don't have enough information to conclude this statement. It's possible that raths chortled at Bungo, or that toves snicker-snacked Rafin, or both, or neither.\n\n2. Not all toves chortled at Rafin or not all borogoves are mimsy.\n\nWe know that every tove galumphed over Rafin, but we don't know if they chortled at Rafin. We also know that only raths are mimsy, so not all borogoves are mimsy. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. Not all raths chortled at Bungo if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nSimilar to option 1, we don't have enough information to conclude this statement.\n\n4. Not all toves chortled at Rafin and only borogoves are mimsy.\n\nWe know that not all toves chortled at Rafin (we don't have enough information to conclude that they do). However, we also know that only raths are mimsy, not borogoves. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. No borogoves chortled at Rafin and not all toves are mimsy.\n\nWe don't know if borogoves chortled at Rafin, and we know that not all toves are mimsy (because only raths are mimsy). However, we can't conclude that no borogoves chortled at Rafin. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. Not all toves chortled at Rafin and a borogove is mimsy.\n\nWe know that not all toves chortled at Rafin, but we also know that no borogoves are mimsy (only raths are mimsy).

Bungo is a tove just in case no toves gimbled.\n5. A tove is beamish or it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n1. If a tove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Bungo won't whiffle only if every borogove galumphed over Zindle.\n\nThis statement is false. Since no borogoves galumphed over Zindle, the condition \"every borogove galumphed over Zindle\" is never true. Therefore, the implication \"Bungo won't whiffle\" cannot be deduced.\n\n2. If no toves galumphed over Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin only if Zindle will whiffle.\n\nThis statement is also false. The conditions \"no toves galumphed over Bungo\" and \"not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" are unrelated to \"Zindle will whiffle\". Zindle can be a rath, and there is no information about its behavior.\n\n3. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo won't whiffle only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\nThis statement is true. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo might be a tove that whiffles (since only toves whiffle). However, if Bungo whiffles, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, because Bungo is a tove that didn't snicker-snack Rafin.\n\n4. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo isn't beamish.\n\nThis statement is also false. The conditions \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" and \"not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" are unrelated to \"Bungo isn't beamish\". Bungo's beamishness does not affect the behavior of toves or borogoves.\n\n5. If a tove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all borogoves will whiffle.\n\nThis statement is false. Since only toves whiffle, and borogoves do not whiffle, the condition \"not all borogoves will whiffle\" is always true. However, this does not imply that Bungo galumphed over Zindle.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement is:\n\n3. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo won't whiffle only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.",
