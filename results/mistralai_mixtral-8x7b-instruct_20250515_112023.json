If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then not all borogoves will whiffle only if Bungo didn't chortle at Rafin.\n2.

If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then not all borogoves will whiffle only if Bungo didn't chortle at Rafin.\n   This statement is not necessarily true. The fact that no raths chortled at Bungo means that Zindle will whiffle if and only if only toves whiffle. However, the condition about borogoves chortling at Rafin is not related to this. It's possible that some borogoves fail to whiffle even if Bungo did chortle at Rafin.\n\n2. If Rafin will whiffle, then every borogove galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n   This statement isn't necessarily true. If Rafin will whiffle, it means only toves whiffle. But it's possible that every borogove galumphed over Zindle regardless of whether all toves chortled at Bungo or not.\n\n3. If no toves galumphed over Bungo, then Zindle will whiffle only if every borogove chortled at Rafin.\n   This statement is true. If no toves galumphed over Bungo, then only toves can whiffle. And since Zindle is beamish and will whiffle, it implies that every borogove chortled at Rafin.\n\n4. If no toves galumphed over Bungo, then Rafin will whiffle only if no borogoves chortled at Zindle.\n   This statement is not necessarily true. If no toves galumphed over Bungo, then only toves can whiffle. However, whether Rafin will whiffle or not doesn't depend on whether any borogoves chortled at Zindle or not.\n\n5. If every tove chortled at Zindle, then Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo only if not all borogoves will whiffle.\n   This statement isn't necessarily true. Even if every tove chortled at Zindle, it doesn't mean that Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo. And even if not all borogoves whiffle, it doesn't mean that Rafin galumphed over Bungo.\n\n6. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo won't whiffle only if every borogove chortled at Rafin.\n   This statement is not necessarily true. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Zindle might still whiffle. But even if Bungo doesn't whiffle, it doesn't necessarily mean that every borogove chortled at Rafin.\n\nBased on the analysis above, statement 3 is the only statement that must be true given the initial conditions.",

If a tove snicker-snacked Rafin, then a rath galumphed over Bungo only if Bungo didn't gyre.\n5. If a rath galumphed over Bungo, then no borogoves chortled at Zindle only if Rafin is a tove.\n6. If Zindle isn't a tove, then a rath galumphed over Bungo only if every borogove chortled at Rafin.\n",

      "model_response": " Let's break down the given information and the statements to determine which ones must be true.\n\n1. A rath gyred only if every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n   We cannot definitively say that this must be true because there is no information connecting a rath's gyring with the condition of all toves galumphing over Rafin.\n\n2. A rath gyred and not all toves galumphed over Rafin.\n   This could be true, as there is no contradiction in these two statements.\n\n3. Every rath gyred or a tove galumphed over Rafin.\n   This must be true. If not all raths gyred, then all toves galumphed over Rafin (from the given information). So, in any case, at least one of these two conditions is true.\n\n4. If a rath gyred, then every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n   We cannot definitively say that this must be true, as there is no information connecting a rath's gyring with the condition of all toves galumphing over Rafin.\n\n5. Not all toves galumphed over Rafin or every rath gyred.\n   This is the contrapositive of statement 4, so if 4 is false, then 5 must be true. But since 4 is not necessarily true, we can't definitively say that 5 is true either.\n\n6. Not all toves galumphed over Rafin unless every rath gyred.\n   This is the contrapositive of statement 3, which we determined to be true. However, the word \"unless\" in statement 6 is sometimes used to mean \"if and only if,\" but sometimes it is used to mean \"if\". In formal logic, we should avoid ambiguous language like this, but in this case, since we know statement 3 is true, we can interpret statement 6 to mean the same thing and thus conclude that 6 is true.\n\nSo, the statement that must be true is number 3, and we can also argue that statement 6 must be true, depending on how it's interpreted.",

However, we don't have enough information to conclude that every borogove indeed galumphed over Bungo.\n\n2.

If a tove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Bungo won't whiffle only if every borogove galumphed over Zindle.\n   We cannot conclude this. We know that toves can whiffle, but we don't know if Bungo specifically will whiffle when a tove snicker-snacks Rafin. Even if only some borogoves or no borogoves galumphed over Zindle, Bungo still might not whiffle.\n\n2. If no toves galumphed over Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin only if Zindle will whiffle.\n   We cannot conclude this. The condition about Zindle whiffle only applies when not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin. There could be cases where no toves galumphed over Bungo, but we don't have enough information to determine whether or not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin or if Zindle will whiffle.\n\n3. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo won't whiffle only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n   This must be true. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Bungo won't whiffle (as per the second condition given). The only way Bungo won't whiffle is if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin (as per the first condition).\n\n4. If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo isn't beamish.\n   We cannot conclude this. Not galumphing over Zindle by toves doesn't provide any information about Bungo's beamishness.\n\n5. If a tove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all borogoves will whiffle.\n   We cannot conclude this. We don't have enough information to connect a tove snicker-snacking Rafin with Bungo's actions regarding Zindle, and not all borogoves whiffling is not necessarily linked to a tove snicker-snacking Rafin.\n\nHence, only statement 3 must be true.",
