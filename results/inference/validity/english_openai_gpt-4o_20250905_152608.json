This gives us some information about interactions but doesn't directly affect the donkey-monkey interactions.\n\n6. **Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement: if every monkey chased Hazel, then every human chased Hazel, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Every donkey saw every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey\" only requires each donkey to see at least one monkey, not every monkey.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts the condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **There is a donkey that every monkey saw.**\n   - There is no information given that supports this statement. The conditions do not imply that any donkey is seen by every monkey.\n\n4. **A donkey saw a monkey.**\n   - This must be true because the condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey\" implies that at least one donkey saw at least one monkey.\n\n5. **A donkey saw every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey\" does not imply that any donkey saw every monkey.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw every monkey.**\n   - This is consistent with the condition \"Every donkey saw a monkey,\" which does not require any donkey to see every monkey.

However, Alfred cannot be a monkey because a monkey chasing another monkey is already accounted for in the second point.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Alfred is a donkey.**\n   - Not necessarily true. Alfred could be a human who chased a monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The information only states that Hazel saw every monkey, not that every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n3. **A monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel saw every monkey, it is reasonable to conclude that at least one monkey saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts the information that Hazel saw every monkey, which implies that at least one monkey saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This is false because Hazel saw every monkey, implying that at least one monkey saw Hazel.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a monkey.**\n   - This is explicitly stated in the problem: Hazel saw every monkey.

This means for every human \\( H \\), \\( H \\) kicked \\( D_1 \\).\n\n3. **If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.**  \n   This is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n   - Assume Lewis is a human (since a human saw Lewis, and only donkeys are asleep, Lewis cannot be a donkey, and if Lewis were a monkey, a human seeing a monkey is not informative).\n   - If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then the statement \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is true.\n   - This means if not all donkeys kicked Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n4. **A human saw Lewis and only donkeys are asleep.**  \n   This implies Lewis is not a donkey (since only donkeys are asleep), and since a human saw Lewis, Lewis is likely a human or a monkey. However, given the context, Lewis is more likely a human.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **A human kicked a donkey.**  \n   True, because every human kicked the donkey \\( D_1 \\).\n\n2. **A donkey kicked a human.**  \n   There is no information given that suggests any donkey kicked a human.

This is because:\n\n- If every donkey is happy, condition 3 is satisfied regardless of whether they chased Alfred.\n- If not every donkey is happy, condition 3 requires that every donkey chased Alfred.\n- If no donkeys are happy, condition 4 is satisfied regardless of whether they chased Alfred.\n- If some donkeys are happy, condition 4 requires that every donkey chased Alfred.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that every donkey chased Alfred.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Every donkey chased Alfred.**\n   - This must be true based on our analysis.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This is false because we concluded that every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n3. **No donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This is false because we concluded that every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n4. **Alfred chased a donkey.**\n   - There is no information given about Alfred chasing any donkey, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n5. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - There is no information given about Alfred's happiness, so this cannot be concluded.\n\n6. **Alfred chased every donkey.**\n   - There is no information given about Alfred chasing any donkey, so this cannot be concluded.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n1. **Every donkey chased Alfred.**\n\nFinal Answer: 1. Every donkey chased Alfred.",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's analyze the given statements and conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means every individual in the scenario is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **Alfred doesn't see Alfred.**\n   - Alfred cannot see himself.\n\n3. **If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. If all monkeys see Lewis, then for all monkeys to be asleep, Lewis must be a donkey.\n\n4. **A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - At least one human saw Lewis. Hazel can see herself.\n\n5. **Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - Alfred is awake. Lewis cannot see Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - This contradicts the given condition that Alfred isn't asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - A human saw Lewis is true, but \"it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep\" implies Alfred is asleep, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred.**\n   - Since Alfred doesn't see Alfred (given), the condition \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is false. Therefore, \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred\" simplifies to \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" because the condition is false. This statement is true if Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n\n4. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep.**\n   - This is a disjunction. If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, the statement is true. If a human is asleep, the statement is also true. We know a human saw Lewis, but we don't have information about whether they are asleep. However, since Alfred doesn't see Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel, it's plausible that Alfred doesn't see Lewis, making this statement true.\n\n5. **A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - Both parts of this conjunction are true based on the given conditions. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless a human is asleep.**\n   - This is equivalent to saying if no human is asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis. We don't have information about whether humans are asleep, but if we assume Alfred doesn't see Lewis (as per statement 4), this statement holds true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **4. Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep.**\n- **5. A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that statements 4 and 5 must be true.",

Every monkey saw Alfred.\n6. It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel, which means Lewis does see Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **Alfred and Hazel will attack.**\n   - We know Alfred will attack (from condition 2), but we have no information about Hazel attacking. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A monkey saw Alfred only if a donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. The condition \"a monkey saw Alfred\" is true because every monkey saw Alfred (from condition 5). However, \"a donkey saw Lewis\" is false because no donkeys saw Lewis (from condition 3). Therefore, the statement \"A monkey saw Alfred only if a donkey saw Lewis\" is false because the condition is true, but the consequence is false.\n\n3. **Alfred won't attack.**\n   - This contradicts condition 2, which states that Alfred will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Lewis and Hazel will attack.**\n   - We know Lewis will attack (from condition 2), but we have no information about Hazel attacking. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **If a monkey saw Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This is similar to statement 2. The condition \"a monkey saw Alfred\" is true, but \"a donkey saw Lewis\" is false. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw Lewis and every monkey saw Alfred.**\n   - This statement directly restates conditions 3 and 5. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n6. No donkeys saw Lewis and every monkey saw Alfred.",

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Hazel will run.**\n   - There is no information given about Hazel running or not running.

However, it doesn't directly affect the truth of the other statements unless we know more about the happiness condition.\n\n3. **Every donkey saw Hazel only if a donkey saw Lewis.**  \n   This is a conditional statement: If every donkey saw Hazel, then at least one donkey saw Lewis.\n\n4. **If not all humans chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Lewis.**  \n   This is another conditional statement: If there exists at least one human who did not chase Lewis, then there exists at least one donkey who did not see Lewis.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Lewis saw a donkey.**  \n   There is no information given that directly supports or contradicts this statement. It is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**  \n   This statement could be true if the condition \"if not all humans chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Lewis\" is satisfied. However, we don't have information about whether all humans chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**  \n   This statement is a combination of two claims.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every donkey saw Lewis.**  \n   This statement would contradict the condition \"if not all humans chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Lewis\" if not all humans chased Lewis. Since we don't have information about whether all humans chased Lewis, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Lewis saw every donkey.**  \n   There is no information given that directly supports or contradicts this statement.

However, we don't have information about whether every donkey saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the statements must be true based on the information provided.

It suggests a conditional situation where if every monkey chased Lewis, then it must be the case that not all monkeys chased Lewis, which is a contradiction. Therefore, not every monkey chased Lewis.\n\n5. **If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - This condition is a bit convoluted. If a human chased Lewis, then the statement \"every monkey chased Hazel\" is true only if \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is true. Since Hazel is a human, and typically an entity doesn't chase itself, this condition seems to imply that if a human chased Lewis, then every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **A donkey saw a human.**\n   - Given that no donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Lewis, and Hazel is a human, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the information provided.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw a human.**\n   - This statement is consistent with the information that no donkeys saw Hazel (a human) and no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n3. **A donkey saw every human.**\n   - This cannot be true because no donkeys saw Hazel, who is a human.\n\n4. **Every donkey saw a human.**\n   - This cannot be true because no donkeys saw Hazel, who is a human.\n\n5. **Every donkey saw every human.**\n   - This cannot be true because no donkeys saw Hazel, who is a human.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw every human.**\n   - This statement must be true because no donkeys saw Hazel, who is a human. Therefore, no donkey could have seen every human.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n6. No donkeys saw every human.",

Let's break it down:\n   - \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is the antecedent.\n   - \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every human saw Hazel\" is the consequent.\n   - The consequent can be rewritten as: \"If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **No humans are asleep.**  \n   This contradicts the condition that every human is asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Hazel is asleep.**  \n   We don't have enough information to determine if Hazel is asleep. Hazel could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey. If Hazel is a human, then Hazel is asleep. If Hazel is a donkey or a monkey, we don't have information about their sleep status. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Not all humans are asleep if and only if a human is asleep.**  \n   This statement is logically inconsistent. \"Not all humans are asleep\" implies that at least one human is awake, which contradicts the condition that every human is asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Only humans are asleep.**  \n   This statement is consistent with the information given. We know every human is asleep, and we have no information about the sleep status of donkeys or monkeys. Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n5. **A human is asleep.**  \n   Since every human is asleep, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Not all humans are asleep.**  \n   This contradicts the condition that every human is asleep.

            "raw_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given statements and their implications:\n\n1. **Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.**  \n   This implies that for any monkey \\( M \\), there exists another monkey \\( M' \\) such that \\( M \\) chased \\( M' \\) and \\( M' \\) chased \\( M \\). This suggests a mutual chasing relationship between monkeys.\n\n2. **A monkey chased Alfred and every human chased Alfred.**  \n   This indicates that Alfred is either a human or a donkey (since a monkey chased him, and every human chased him).\n\n3. **A monkey is happy but it is not the case that Lewis didn't chase Hazel.**  \n   This implies that Lewis chased Hazel. Since Lewis chased someone, Lewis cannot be a donkey (as donkeys are not mentioned to chase anyone), so Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n\n4. **Every donkey saw Hazel only if not all donkeys are hungry.**  \n   This statement doesn't directly affect the relationships between monkeys, humans, and donkeys in terms of chasing.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **There is a monkey that every monkey chased.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The statement \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it\" implies mutual chasing, but not necessarily that there is one specific monkey that every monkey chased.\n\n2. **A monkey chased a monkey.**  \n   This must be true. From the statement \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it,\" it follows that there is at least one instance where a monkey chased another monkey.\n\n3. **A monkey chased every monkey.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The mutual chasing relationship does not imply that there is one monkey that chased every other monkey.\n\n4. **No monkeys chased a monkey.**  \n   This is false, as it contradicts the statement \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\"\n\n5. **Every monkey chased every monkey.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. The mutual chasing relationship implies that each monkey chased at least one other monkey, but not necessarily every other monkey.\n\n6. **No monkeys chased every monkey.**  \n   This is consistent with the mutual chasing relationship, as it does not require any single monkey to have chased every other monkey.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n2. **A monkey chased a monkey.**",

The second part \"not all humans are hungry\" could be true, but we need more analysis.\n\nGiven the conditions, the statement that must be true is:\n\n3.

Every donkey chased Alfred unless every donkey kicked Lewis.\n4. Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n5. Not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\n6. No humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We have no direct information about whether Alfred or Lewis drank. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n2. **No humans are hungry unless only donkeys drank.**\n   - \"No humans are hungry\" is equivalent to \"every monkey chased Hazel\" (from statement 6).\n   - \"Only donkeys drank\" implies that neither humans nor monkeys drank.\n   - This statement suggests that if no humans are hungry, then only donkeys drank. However, we don't have enough information to confirm this relationship. This statement cannot be determined to be true.\n\n3. **No humans are hungry or only donkeys drank.**\n   - This is a disjunction: either \"no humans are hungry\" (which is equivalent to \"every monkey chased Hazel\") or \"only donkeys drank.\"\n   - From statement 5, \"Not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel,\" we know that if every monkey chased Hazel, then not all donkeys drank, which contradicts \"only donkeys drank.\"\n   - Therefore, if \"no humans are hungry\" is true, then \"only donkeys drank\" cannot be true simultaneously. However, the disjunction allows for either condition to be true independently, so this statement can be true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys drank just in case no humans are hungry.**\n   - \"Not all donkeys drank\" is equivalent to \"every monkey chased Hazel\" (from statement 5).\n   - \"No humans are hungry\" is also equivalent to \"every monkey chased Hazel\" (from statement 6).\n   - Therefore, this statement is true because both conditions are equivalent.\n\n5. **Not all humans are hungry and every donkey drank.**\n   - \"Not all humans are hungry\" implies that some humans are hungry, which contradicts \"no humans are hungry\" (equivalent to \"every monkey chased Hazel\").\n   - \"Every donkey drank\" contradicts \"not all donkeys drank\" (equivalent to \"every monkey chased Hazel\").\n   - This statement cannot be true because it contradicts the equivalences established in statements 5 and 6.\n\n6. **Alfred drank.**\n   - We have no direct information about whether Alfred drank. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **3.

No donkeys will attack just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Hazel is hungry, the condition \"No donkeys will attack just in case Hazel isn't hungry\" does not apply. Therefore, it is possible for donkeys to attack because Hazel is indeed hungry.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **Only donkeys will attack.**  \n   This statement suggests that if there is an attack, it will be exclusively by donkeys. However, the problem does not provide information about the behavior of humans or monkeys, so we cannot conclude that only donkeys will attack.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys will attack.**  \n   The problem does not specify whether all donkeys will attack or not. Since Hazel is hungry, it is possible for some or all donkeys to attack, but we cannot definitively say that not all will attack.\n\n3. **No donkeys will attack.**  \n   This statement contradicts the condition that donkeys can attack if Hazel is hungry. Since Hazel is hungry, it is possible for donkeys to attack, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Lewis will attack.**  \n   There is no information provided about Lewis's behavior or conditions that would lead to Lewis attacking. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lewis will attack.\n\n5. **A donkey will attack.**  \n   Since Hazel is hungry, the condition that prevents donkeys from attacking is not met. Therefore, it is possible for at least one donkey to attack. This statement is consistent with the given conditions.\n\n6. **Every donkey will attack.**  \n   The problem does not specify that every donkey must attack when Hazel is hungry, only that they can attack. Therefore, we cannot conclude that every donkey will attack.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true given the conditions is:\n\n5. **A donkey will attack.**",

The contrapositive is: If all humans chased Lewis, then no human chased Lewis (which is a contradiction, so this situation cannot occur).\n\n4. **If Lewis won't run, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This is a bit complex. Let's break it down:\n     - If Lewis won't run, then the statement \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" must hold.\n     - This means: If not all donkeys kicked Hazel, then no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n     - The contrapositive is: If some monkeys kicked Hazel, then all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **A human chased Lewis.**\n   - This could be true, but it doesn't have to be true. The condition allows for the possibility that no human chased Lewis if all humans chased Lewis, which is a contradiction, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Lewis chased a human.**\n   - There is no information given that directly supports this statement. It is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis chased every human.**\n   - Again, there is no information given that directly supports this statement. It is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n   - This statement aligns with the condition that a human chased Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis. If a human chased Lewis, then this statement must be true. However, if no human chased Lewis, this statement could still be true. Therefore, this statement is consistent with the conditions and must be true.\n\n5. **Every human chased Lewis.**\n   - This would contradict the condition that a human chased Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **No humans chased Lewis.**\n   - This is possible, but not necessarily true. The condition allows for the possibility that some humans chased Lewis, as long as not all did. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n4. **Not all humans chased Lewis.**",

The condition involving Lewis's hunger is conditional on a human chasing Lewis, which is not confirmed in the problem.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a monkey.**\n   - Since every monkey saw Hazel, and it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel, Hazel cannot be a monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Hazel is a monkey.**\n   - This contradicts the conclusion from statement 3. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Lewis and Hazel are hungry.**\n   - We have no information confirming that both Lewis and Hazel are hungry.

It can be rewritten as: If all humans chased Lewis, then some humans chased Hazel.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred and only donkeys ate.**\n   - This implies that some donkeys did not chase Alfred, and that eating is an activity exclusive to donkeys.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Alfred ate.**\n   - Since only donkeys ate, for Alfred to have eaten, Alfred must be a donkey. However, the problem states \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred,\" which doesn't directly imply anything about Alfred eating. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A human is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - We know a human is happy (from statement 2 of the problem). The phrase \"just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" Since not all donkeys chased Alfred (from statement 4 of the problem), this statement is true.\n\n3. **Alfred didn't eat.**\n   - This is the opposite of statement 1. Since only donkeys ate, and we have no information that directly confirms Alfred ate, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel ate.**\n   - Since only donkeys ate, both Alfred and Hazel must be donkeys to have eaten. However, we have no information confirming Hazel ate, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis ate.**\n   - Similar to statement 4, both Alfred and Lewis must be donkeys to have eaten. We have no information confirming Lewis ate, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - We know a human is happy, but the problem states \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred,\" not \"no donkeys chased Alfred.\" Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n2.

If every monkey kicked Lewis, then not all humans kicked Hazel.\n\nWe need to determine which of the given statements must be true based on these conditions.\n\nLet's focus on the conditional statement: \"If every monkey kicked Lewis, then not all humans kicked Hazel.\" We know from the problem that every monkey did indeed kick Lewis. Therefore, the condition \"not all humans kicked Hazel\" must be true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. No humans kicked Hazel.\n   - This statement is too strong. The condition \"not all humans kicked Hazel\" only implies that at least one human did not kick Hazel, not that no humans kicked Hazel.\n\n2. Every human kicked Hazel.\n   - This directly contradicts the condition \"not all humans kicked Hazel.\"\n\n3. A human kicked Hazel.\n   - This is possible, but not necessarily true. The condition \"not all humans kicked Hazel\" only tells us that at least one human did not kick Hazel, but it doesn't guarantee that any human did kick Hazel.\n\n4. Hazel kicked a human.\n   - There is no information in the problem that supports or contradicts this statement. It is not necessarily true.\n\n5. Not all humans kicked Hazel.\n   - This statement directly matches the condition derived from the problem: \"If every monkey kicked Lewis, then not all humans kicked Hazel.\" Since every monkey did kick Lewis, this statement must be true.\n\n6. Hazel kicked every human.\n   - There is no information in the problem that supports this statement. It is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n5.

If every monkey chased Lewis, then no humans chased Hazel.\n5. If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n6.

However, we have no information about whether a monkey is happy. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n2. **Every monkey kicked Lewis and a monkey is happy.**\n   - This contradicts condition 2, which states that not all monkeys kicked Lewis. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is happy.**\n   - Condition 2 confirms that not all monkeys kicked Lewis. Condition 8 states that Lewis isn't happy. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - We need to determine if Alfred will attack. From condition 6, if Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis. Since not all monkeys kicked Lewis (condition 2), this condition doesn't apply. We don't have enough information to conclude that Alfred will attack.\n\n5. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis is happy.**\n   - Condition 2 confirms that not all monkeys kicked Lewis, but condition 8 states that Lewis isn't happy. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis will attack.**\n   - We have no information about Lewis attacking, and we cannot conclude that Alfred will attack based on the given conditions. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is happy.**",

This statement is true.\n\n3. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - Alfred drank (true, as he is a human). However, we don't have enough information to determine if Lewis drank, as we don't know if Lewis is a human or not. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n4. **Alfred drank.**\n   - True, because Alfred is a human and every human drank.\n\n5. **Lewis drank.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Lewis drank, as we don't know if Lewis is a human or not. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - Alfred drank (true, as he is a human).

This is a tautology because if all humans are asleep, then certainly at least one human is asleep, and vice versa. However, since we know Alfred is not asleep, not all humans are asleep, making this statement false in this context.\n\n3. **A human is asleep.**\n   - We know Alfred is a human and is not asleep. However, this does not provide information about other humans. There could be other humans who are asleep, but we cannot definitively conclude this from the given information.

We need to determine if Lewis chased Lewis or not to evaluate this condition.\n\n   - Since Lewis is not a monkey (from point 3), Lewis could be either a donkey or a human. The problem doesn't provide information about Lewis chasing Lewis, so we assume Lewis didn't chase Lewis to explore the implications.\n\n   - If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then the condition \"every monkey is asleep only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" applies. This means:\n     - If every monkey is asleep, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n     - Conversely, if all donkeys kicked Hazel, then not every monkey is asleep.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Alfred isn't asleep.**  \n   We don't have direct information about Alfred's state of being asleep or not.\n\n2. **Alfred is asleep.**  \n   Similarly, we don't have direct information about Alfred's state of being asleep or not.\n\n3. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**  \n   We don't have enough information to conclude this.\n\n4. **Lewis is a monkey.**  \n   This is false because we determined that Lewis is not a monkey.\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**  \n   We don't have enough information to conclude this.\n\n6. **Lewis isn't a monkey.**  \n   This must be true because we deduced that Lewis is not a monkey based on the statement \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\"\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all humans are hungry.\n3. Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n4. If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Hazel is hungry.\n5. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n6. Alfred isn't hungry.\n7. Lewis isn't happy.\n8. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n9. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. **Alfred is a monkey.**\n   - If Alfred is a monkey, then according to statement 8, Alfred would have to chase himself, which contradicts statement 3 (\"Alfred didn't chase Alfred\"). Therefore, Alfred cannot be a monkey.\n\n2. **Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - We need to determine if this must be true. If Alfred were asleep, it would not directly contradict any given statements. However, we need more information to conclude this definitively.\n\n3. **Alfred isn't a monkey.**\n   - As reasoned in option 1, Alfred cannot be a monkey because it would lead to a contradiction with statement 3. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - Similar to option 2, we need more information to determine if Alfred being asleep is necessary. There is no direct contradiction if Alfred is asleep, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n   - We have no information that directly implies both Alfred and Lewis must be asleep. Lewis's happiness or sleep status is not directly addressed in the given statements, so this cannot be concluded as necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n   - Similar to option 5, there is no direct information that requires both Alfred and Hazel to be asleep. Hazel's hunger status is more relevant to the conditions given, but not her sleep status.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true without leading to any contradictions is:\n\n**3. Alfred isn't a monkey.**",

Let's break it down:\n     - If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then the condition \"every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel\" must hold.\n     - The phrase \"only if\" indicates a necessary condition, so \"every monkey saw Hazel\" implies \"every human saw Hazel.\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Every human saw Hazel.**\n   - This statement would satisfy the condition \"every human saw Hazel\" in the conditional statement. However, we need to determine if it must be true in all cases.\n\n2. **No humans saw Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts the statement that Hazel saw every human, as seeing is typically a mutual action. If Hazel saw every human, at least some humans must have seen Hazel.\n\n3. **Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - This is the negation of statement 1. We need to determine if it's possible for this to be true without contradiction.\n\n4. **Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement. If Hazel is a human, then Hazel saw herself, which satisfies the condition of a human seeing Hazel. If Hazel isn't a human, then we need to check if a human seeing Hazel is necessary.\n\n5. **A human saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel saw every human, and seeing is typically mutual, it is reasonable to conclude that at least one human saw Hazel.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a human.**\n   - This is explicitly stated in the problem: Hazel saw every human.\n\nLet's focus on the conditional statement: \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\"\n\n- If Alfred did kick Hazel, the conditional statement is irrelevant, and we only need to satisfy the other conditions.\n- If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then for the conditional to be true, either:\n  - Every human saw Hazel, or\n  - Not every monkey saw Hazel.\n\nGiven that Hazel saw every human, it is reasonable to conclude that at least one human saw Hazel, satisfying statement 5.\n\n**Final Answer: 5.

The given information does not specify who chased whom, except for the chain involving donkeys, humans, and monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred isn't happy.**\n   - There is no information provided about Alfred's happiness. We cannot conclude that Alfred isn't happy based on the given information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n   - We know a monkey is happy, but we have no information about Alfred's or Lewis's happiness. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - Again, there is no information about Alfred's happiness. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred is happy and a monkey chased Alfred.**\n   - As previously mentioned, we have no information about Alfred's happiness or whether a monkey chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n1.

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n2. **Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - The phrase \"just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" We have no information about whether Lewis saw himself or whether humans saw Hazel, so we cannot determine the truth of this statement based on the given information.\n\n3. **A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - We know a human saw Lewis (condition 5), but we have no information about whether Hazel saw herself. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of this statement.\n\n4. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - We know a human saw Lewis (condition 5), but we have no information about whether Hazel saw herself. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of this statement.\n\n5. **Lewis saw Lewis just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n   - Again, \"just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" We have no information about whether Lewis saw himself or whether a human saw Hazel, so we cannot determine the truth of this statement.\n\n6. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - We know a human saw Lewis (condition 5), and we know that Lewis doesn't see Hazel (condition 3). Therefore, the second part of this statement is false, making the entire statement false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true given the conditions is:\n\n1. A human saw Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 1 must be true.",

The problem states that every monkey saw Alfred, but it doesn't specify that Alfred saw any monkey.\n\n2. **A monkey saw Alfred.**\n   - This must be true because it is explicitly stated that every monkey saw Alfred.\n\n3. **Alfred saw every monkey.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The problem only states that every monkey saw Alfred, not the other way around.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n   - We know Alfred is happy, but there is no information about Lewis's happiness.\n\n5. **Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This is false because it is explicitly stated that every monkey saw Alfred.\n\n6. **No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - This is false because it contradicts the statement that every monkey saw Alfred.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n2. A monkey saw Alfred.",

However, the condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it\" does not imply that every donkey must be kicked by another donkey. It only establishes a reciprocal kicking relationship if a kicking occurs. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No donkeys kicked a donkey.**  \n   This contradicts the condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it,\" which implies that if a donkey is kicked, it must kick back. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked every donkey.**  \n   This is a stronger statement than required by the conditions. The condition only establishes a reciprocal relationship, not that every donkey kicks every other donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.**  \n   This would imply a specific donkey is kicked by all other donkeys. The conditions do not support this, as they only establish reciprocal kicking if a kicking occurs. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked a donkey.**  \n   Given the condition \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it,\" there must be at least one instance of a donkey kicking another donkey to satisfy this condition. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked every donkey.**  \n   This statement is consistent with the conditions, as the conditions do not require any donkey to kick every other donkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- **5. A donkey kicked a donkey.**\n- **6.

There is a monkey (M2) that chased Alfred, and every human chased Alfred.\n\n4. **If a monkey kicked Hazel, then every donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement.

Additionally, every donkey drank.\n\n3. **A monkey is hungry and Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - This indicates that there is at least one hungry monkey. Hazel saw Alfred, but this doesn't provide information about Hazel's species.\n\n4. **Every monkey drank but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - This implies that every monkey drank. The phrase \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry\" means that Lewis is hungry. Since we know a monkey is hungry, Lewis must be a monkey.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Not all monkeys drank.**\n   - This is false because the problem states that every monkey drank.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We know that every monkey drank, and Lewis is a monkey, so Lewis drank. However, we don't have enough information to conclude that Alfred drank because Alfred could be a human, and the problem doesn't state that humans drank. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred drank.**\n   - As mentioned above, we cannot conclude that Alfred drank because he could be a human, and the problem doesn't state that humans drank. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Only monkeys drank.**\n   - This is false because the problem states that every donkey drank, so donkeys also drank.\n\n5. **A monkey drank.**\n   - This is true because the problem states that every monkey drank, so at least one monkey drank.\n\n6. **No monkeys drank.**\n   - This is false because the problem states that every monkey drank.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n5. **A monkey drank.**",

Conversely, if all donkeys will attack, then every monkey will run.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys will attack or no donkeys are happy.**\n   - This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements must be true: either not all donkeys will attack, or no donkeys are happy.\n\n3. **No donkeys are happy unless every donkey will attack.**\n   - This implies that if every donkey attacks, then donkeys can be happy. If not every donkey attacks, then no donkeys are happy.\n\nLet's analyze the implications:\n\n- From statement 3, if not every donkey attacks, then no donkeys are happy.\n- From statement 2, if not all donkeys will attack, then no donkeys are happy must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n- Therefore, if not all donkeys attack, it follows that no donkeys are happy.\n\nNow, consider the case where every donkey attacks:\n- If every donkey attacks, then from statement 3, it is possible for donkeys to be happy.\n- However, statement 2 does not force donkeys to be happy; it only states that if not all donkeys attack, then no donkeys are happy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n1. **No donkeys are happy.**\n   - This must be true if not all donkeys attack. If all donkeys attack, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every donkey is happy.**\n   - This is not necessarily true, even if all donkeys attack, because the condition allows for the possibility of happiness but does not guarantee it.\n\n3. **A donkey is happy.**\n   - This is not necessarily true, as it depends on whether all donkeys attack and whether happiness is achieved.\n\n4. **Every donkey will run.**\n   - This is not necessarily true, as the running condition applies to monkeys, not donkeys.\n\n5. **Only donkeys are happy.**\n   - This is not necessarily true, as it depends on the happiness of donkeys, which is not guaranteed.\n\n6. **A human will attack and no humans will attack.**\n   - This is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1. **No donkeys are happy.**\n\nThis is because if not all donkeys attack, then no donkeys are happy must be true to satisfy the disjunction in statement 2.

The condition about humans being asleep unless every donkey will attack doesn't directly imply that Alfred will attack.\n\n4. **No donkeys saw Lewis and every donkey drank.**\n   - This statement is a combination of two given conditions: \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" and \"Every donkey drank.\" Both of these are explicitly stated in the problem, so this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all donkeys drank.**\n   - This statement is not supported by any given information.

This is because the premise (a monkey saw Alfred) is true, so the conclusion (every monkey saw Lewis) must also be true.\n\n4. **Analyzing Statements**:\n   - **Statement 1**: \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.\" This is a contradiction because it states both that not all monkeys kicked Lewis and that every monkey kicked Lewis. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n   - **Statement 2**: \"Lewis saw every monkey.\" We have no information to confirm or deny this statement based on the given conditions.\n   - **Statement 3**: \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis.\" This contradicts our deduction that every monkey saw Lewis, so this statement is false.\n   - **Statement 4**: \"No monkeys saw Lewis.\" This is false because we deduced that every monkey saw Lewis.\n   - **Statement 5**: \"Every monkey saw Lewis.\" This is true based on our deduction.\n   - **Statement 6**: \"Lewis saw a monkey.\" We have no information to confirm or deny this statement based on the given conditions.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only statement that must be true based on the given conditions and logical deductions is Statement 5: \"Every monkey saw Lewis.\"\n\n**Final Answer**: 5.

It does not imply that every human saw every other human.\n\n3. **A human saw a human.**\n   - Since a human kicked another human (from the monkey kicking scenario), and given the symmetric seeing relationship, at least one human must have seen another human. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Every human saw a human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The problem does not guarantee that every human has seen another human, only that if they have seen someone, the relationship is symmetric.\n\n5. **A human saw every human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The problem does not provide information that any human has seen every other human.\n\n6. **No humans saw every human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true.

It means \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true if and only if \"No donkeys chased Alfred\" is true. This implies that either all donkeys chased Alfred or none did.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If every donkey chased Alfred (as per statement 2), then the condition \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred\" implies that no donkeys chased Alfred. This creates a contradiction because it cannot be both that every donkey chased Alfred and no donkeys chased Alfred. Therefore, the only consistent scenario is that no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nGiven this analysis, let's evaluate the provided statements:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This must be true because we concluded that no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n2. **Alfred chased every donkey.**\n   - There is no information to support this statement.

It does not necessarily follow from the given conditions.\n\n6. **Alfred drank.**\n   - Since Alfred is not a human (because if Alfred were a human, he would have drunk, but we have no information supporting that he drank), this statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true in this situation are:\n\n1.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there's at least one of each.\n2. A donkey kicked Lewis.\n3. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n4. Only humans are hungry.\n5. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the statements:\n\n1. **No donkeys kicked Alfred or no humans are hungry.**\n   - We know from the conditions that not all donkeys kicked Alfred, which means some donkeys might have kicked Alfred, but not all. Also, only humans are hungry, so there are definitely some humans who are hungry. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - Since only humans are hungry, for Alfred to be hungry, Alfred must be a human. However, we don't have enough information to conclude that Alfred is a human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Alfred isn't hungry.**\n   - If Alfred isn't hungry, then Alfred is not a human (since only humans are hungry). However, we don't have enough information to conclude that Alfred is not a human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked Alfred unless no humans are hungry.**\n   - This statement suggests that if any humans are hungry, then no donkeys kicked Alfred. However, we know that only humans are hungry, so there are definitely some humans who are hungry. Since not all donkeys kicked Alfred, it is possible that some did, but this statement doesn't necessarily hold true in all cases.\n\n5. **Only humans are hungry and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.**\n   - This statement is directly supported by the conditions given: \"Only humans are hungry\" and \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - For Alfred and Lewis to be hungry, they both must be humans. We don't have enough information to conclude that both are humans. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n5. Only humans are hungry and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.",

Therefore, a human is asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel. This statement is true.\n\n2. \"If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\"\n   - If not all humans are asleep, then not every human chased Hazel (from condition 2). From condition 3, if not every human chased Hazel, then not every monkey chased Hazel. Therefore, the condition \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is vacuously true because the antecedent (every monkey chased Hazel) is false. This statement is true.\n\n3. \"If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\"\n   - If not all humans are asleep, then not every human chased Hazel (from condition 2). From condition 3, if not every human chased Hazel, then not every monkey chased Hazel. The statement \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep\" does not logically follow from the given conditions. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. \"Not all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n   - From condition 2, if not all humans are asleep, then not every human chased Hazel. From condition 3, if not every human chased Hazel, then not every monkey chased Hazel. Therefore, \"not all humans are asleep\" implies \"not every monkey chased Hazel,\" which is the opposite of the statement. This statement is not true.\n\n5. \"Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n   - This is a restatement of the logical equivalence derived from conditions 2 and 3. This statement is true.\n\n6. \"If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\"\n   - If every human is asleep, then every human chased Hazel (from condition 2). From condition 3, if every human chased Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel. The statement \"every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" does not logically follow from the given conditions.

There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **Alfred is happy.**\n   - This is a given fact.\n\n3. **No donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This implies that Lewis is not a donkey, because if Lewis were a donkey, he would have seen himself, contradicting the statement.\n\n4. **There is not a monkey that every monkey saw.**\n   - This means that for any given monkey, there is at least one monkey that did not see it. This implies that not all monkeys see each other.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Alfred is happy and no donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This statement is a combination of two given facts: \"Alfred is happy\" and \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n   - We know Alfred is happy, but we have no information about Lewis's happiness. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **Lewis is happy.**\n   - There is no information provided about Lewis's happiness, so this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Lewis isn't happy.**\n   - Similarly, there is no information provided about Lewis's happiness, so this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n5. **Lewis and Alfred are happy.**\n   - Again, we know Alfred is happy, but we have no information about Lewis's happiness. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n6. **Alfred isn't happy.**\n   - This contradicts the given fact that Alfred is happy.

If a human chases a monkey, then every monkey chases that human.\n\n3. **A monkey kicked Alfred and Lewis didn't kick Alfred.**  \n   This tells us that Alfred was kicked by a monkey, and Lewis, who is not a monkey, did not kick Alfred.\n\n4. **If not all donkeys will run, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.**  \n   This is a conditional statement. If not all donkeys will run, then for Alfred not to have kicked Hazel, it must be true that every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n5. **Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred.**  \n   Hazel, being a monkey, chased Alfred, and since every monkey chased Alfred, this reinforces the idea that Alfred is a human (since monkeys chase humans).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**  \n   There is no information provided about whether Alfred or Lewis will run. This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.**  \n   Since Alfred is a human (as every monkey chased him), he cannot chase himself.

It cannot be true because it states both that a human will attack and no humans will attack simultaneously.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n5.

If Hazel were a donkey, this would contradict the statement that no donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This is a logical equivalence: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true if and only if \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is true.

If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\nWe need to determine which of the given statements must be true based on these conditions.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n- \"Not all monkeys will run\" implies that there is at least one monkey that does not run.\n- \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" means that Hazel was not seen by any donkey.\n- \"Every human saw Alfred\" means that all humans have seen Alfred.\n- The conditional statement \"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel\" can be analyzed as follows:\n  - If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then for Hazel to have kicked Alfred, every monkey must have seen Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. Alfred will run.\n2. Hazel will run.\n3. Hazel and Alfred will run.\n4. Not all monkeys will run and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n5. Alfred won't run.\n6. Alfred and Hazel will run.\n\nFrom the conditions, we know:\n- Not all monkeys will run (condition 2).\n- No donkeys saw Hazel (condition 3).\n\nStatement 4: \"Not all monkeys will run and no donkeys saw Hazel\" directly matches the conditions given. Therefore, statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe other statements (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) do not have sufficient information to be determined as true based on the given conditions. Specifically, we have no information about whether Alfred or Hazel will run, so we cannot conclude the truth of statements 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.\n\nFinal Answer: 4. Not all monkeys will run and no donkeys saw Hazel.",

Also, the statement \"Lewis isn't hungry\" is false, so Lewis is hungry.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Only donkeys are asleep and no humans will run.**  \n   We know only donkeys are asleep, but we cannot conclude that no humans will run because the information given is \"not all humans will run,\" which means some might still run.\n\n2. **A human is asleep or not all donkeys will run.**  \n   Since only donkeys can be asleep, a human cannot be asleep. Therefore, this statement can only be true if \"not all donkeys will run\" is true.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lewis will run.\n\n4. **Not all humans will run and only donkeys are asleep.**  \n   This statement is consistent with the information given: \"not all humans will run\" is explicitly stated, and \"only donkeys are asleep\" is also explicitly stated. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Lewis won't run.**  \n   Similar to statement 3, we have no information about Lewis running or not running, so we cannot conclude this statement as true.\n\n6. **A human is asleep unless not all donkeys will run.**  \n   Since only donkeys can be asleep, a human cannot be asleep. The statement \"A human is asleep unless not all donkeys will run\" implies that if not all donkeys will run, then a human is not asleep, which is consistent with the fact that only donkeys can be asleep.

Also, there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **Lewis is a donkey unless Hazel isn't a human.**\n   - This is a conditional statement: If Hazel isn't a human, then Lewis is not a donkey. Conversely, if Lewis is a donkey, then Hazel must be a human.\n\n3. **A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - This tells us that there is a hungry monkey, and Lewis is not a donkey.\n\n4. **Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - This means Alfred is not hungry, and Lewis is hungry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- From statement 3, we know Lewis is not a donkey. Therefore, according to statement 2, Hazel must be a human (because if Hazel were not a human, Lewis would be a donkey, which contradicts statement 3).\n\n- Since Hazel is a human, Lewis cannot be a donkey, so Lewis must be either a human or a monkey. However, since Hazel is already the human, Lewis must be a monkey (because there is at least one of each, and Lewis cannot be a donkey).\n\n- From statement 4, Lewis is hungry. Since Lewis is a monkey (from the above deduction), this satisfies the condition that a monkey is hungry.\n\n- Alfred is not hungry, as stated in statement 4.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - False. We know Alfred is not hungry.\n\n2. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a contradiction. If Hazel isn't a human, she cannot be a human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Hazel is a human.**\n   - True. We have deduced that Hazel must be a human.\n\n4. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a logical contradiction and is always false.\n\n5. **Hazel isn't a human.**\n   - False. We have deduced that Hazel is a human.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - False. Alfred is not hungry, although Lewis is.\n\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n3. Hazel is a human.",

If donkey A chases donkey B, then donkey B chases donkey A.\n\n4. **Only humans are hungry and every human is happy.**\n   - This means no donkeys or monkeys are hungry, and all humans are happy.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - This is a logical equivalence: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true if and only if \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is true. This implies that either all donkeys chased Alfred, or none did.\n\n6. **If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement involving humans, Lewis, Hazel, and monkeys. It doesn't directly affect the donkey chasing conditions.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **No donkeys chased every donkey.**\n   - This would mean there is no donkey that chased all other donkeys. Given the mutual chasing condition, this statement could be false if there is a scenario where every donkey chases every other donkey.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased every donkey.**\n   - This would mean a complete mutual chasing among all donkeys. This is possible given the mutual chasing condition, but not necessarily true in all scenarios.\n\n3. **A donkey chased a donkey.**\n   - Given the mutual chasing condition, if there is at least one donkey, then it must chase itself (as Lewis saw Lewis, and Lewis could be a donkey). Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased a donkey.**\n   - This is true because every donkey must at least chase itself due to the mutual chasing condition.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.**\n   - This is directly given by the condition \"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **A donkey chased every donkey.**\n   - This would mean there is at least one donkey that chased all other donkeys. This is not necessarily true unless all donkeys chase each other, which is not guaranteed.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n3. A donkey chased a donkey.\n4. Every donkey chased a donkey.\n5. A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\n\nFinal answer: Statements 3, 4, and 5 must be true.",

Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n5.

This chain of events does not directly involve Lewis, but it establishes that there are interactions between monkeys and humans.\n- Not all monkeys kicked Lewis, meaning some monkeys may have kicked Lewis, but not every monkey did.\n- \"It is not the case that Lewis didn't kick Alfred\" implies that Lewis did kick Alfred.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. Not all humans kicked Lewis.\n   - This must be true because no humans kicked Lewis at all, as per the given information.\n\n2. Lewis kicked a human.\n   - There is no information to support that Lewis kicked a human. The statement about Lewis kicking Alfred does not specify Alfred's species.\n\n3. Lewis kicked every human.\n   - This cannot be true because it contradicts the information that no humans kicked Lewis, and there is no evidence that Lewis kicked any humans.\n\n4. Every human kicked Lewis.\n   - This is false because no humans kicked Lewis.\n\n5. A human kicked Lewis or Lewis kicked Lewis.\n   - The first part is false (no humans kicked Lewis), and the second part is not supported by any information. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6.

We don't know what Hazel and Alfred are, but they could be any of the three types (donkey, human, monkey).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **A donkey chased a human.**\n   - This is possible, but not necessarily true based on the information given. We know that if a donkey chased every human, then every donkey chased that donkey, but it doesn't guarantee that a donkey chased a human directly.\n\n2. **A donkey chased every human.**\n   - This is possible, but not necessarily true. The statement \"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human\" does not imply that there exists a donkey that chased every human.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The conditions do not imply that every donkey must have chased a human.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased every human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The conditions do not imply that every donkey must have chased every human.\n\n5. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The conditions do not rule out the possibility that there is a donkey that chased every human.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased a human.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The conditions do not rule out the possibility that some donkeys chased humans.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the statements must be true based on the information provided.

Every monkey ate and a monkey is hungry.\n4. Hazel isn't asleep and Lewis isn't hungry.\n\nWe need to determine which of the given statements must be true based on these conditions.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n- Condition 1 tells us that the world consists of donkeys, humans, and monkeys, with at least one of each.\n- Condition 2 is a conditional statement about chasing and hunger involving humans and Lewis.\n- Condition 3 states that every monkey ate and at least one monkey is hungry.\n- Condition 4 states that Hazel isn't asleep and Lewis isn't hungry.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Hazel ate.**\n   - We know every monkey ate (Condition 3). If Hazel is a monkey, then Hazel ate. If Hazel is not a monkey, we have no information about her eating. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Lewis ate.**\n   - We know Lewis isn't hungry (Condition 4). If Lewis isn't hungry, it doesn't necessarily mean he ate, as he could be a donkey or a human who didn't eat but isn't hungry. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every monkey ate and Hazel isn't asleep.**\n   - Condition 3 confirms every monkey ate. Condition 4 confirms Hazel isn't asleep. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Lewis didn't eat.**\n   - Lewis isn't hungry (Condition 4), but this doesn't necessarily mean he didn't eat. He could have eaten and not be hungry, or he could be a donkey or a human who didn't eat but isn't hungry. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every monkey ate but it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.**\n   - Condition 3 confirms every monkey ate. However, Condition 4 states Hazel isn't asleep, contradicting the second part of this statement. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Lewis and Hazel ate.**\n   - We know every monkey ate (Condition 3). If Hazel is a monkey, she ate. However, we have no information confirming Lewis ate. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. Every monkey ate and Hazel isn't asleep.**",

If the condition is true (every donkey saw Hazel), then the consequence (not all humans kicked Hazel) must also be true.\n\n6. **If every monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis is hungry only if every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - This is another conditional statement. If every monkey saw Lewis, then for Lewis to be hungry, every monkey must have kicked Lewis.\n\n7. **Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - Alfred is not hungry, which means Alfred is not a human (since only humans are hungry).\n   - \"It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry\" means Lewis is hungry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. **Lewis isn't a human.**\n   - Since Lewis is hungry and only humans are hungry, Lewis must be a human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - We know Alfred isn't hungry, so this statement is false.\n\n3. **Lewis is a human.**\n   - As deduced, Lewis is hungry, and only humans are hungry, so Lewis must be a human.

However, since only donkeys are asleep, humans are not asleep, so Hazel didn't chase Lewis.\n- Hazel did chase Hazel, which is consistent with the information provided.\n- Not all donkeys will run, and not all humans will run.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. Not all humans will run and every donkey will run.\n   - This is false because not all donkeys will run.\n\n2. Not all donkeys will run and no humans will run.\n   - This is possible, but not necessarily true because we only know that not all humans will run.\n\n3.

Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every monkey chased Hazel only if every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. The premise \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is not addressed in the given information, so we cannot determine the truth of the entire statement based on the information provided. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every monkey chased Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - The given information states that a monkey chased Alfred, not necessarily every monkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Alfred didn't chase Hazel just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - \"Just in case\" is equivalent to \"if and only if.\" The given information does not provide any details about Alfred chasing Hazel or monkeys seeing Lewis, so we cannot determine the truth of this statement. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Every monkey chased Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Lewis saw Hazel.

Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n3. **Lewis saw a monkey.**\n   - Since Lewis sees Hazel and Hazel is a monkey, Lewis saw a monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Lewis saw every monkey.**\n   - We only know that Lewis sees Hazel, who is a monkey. We have no information about whether Lewis sees other monkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true.\n\n5. **Every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - We only know that Hazel, a monkey, saw Lewis. We have no information about other monkeys seeing Lewis. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true.\n\n6. **No monkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - Since Hazel, a monkey, saw Lewis, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n2.

If every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if every human saw Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **Every donkey is happy.**\n   - If every donkey is happy, then every monkey will run (from statement 4).\n   - However, statement 2 says not all monkeys will run, so not every donkey can be happy.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - This is a contradiction. It cannot be true that not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run simultaneously.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys are happy.**\n   - From statement 1, we concluded that not every donkey can be happy because it would contradict the fact that not all monkeys will run. Therefore, not all donkeys are happy must be true.\n\n4. **No donkeys are happy.**\n   - If no donkeys are happy, then Alfred isn't a human (from statement 5). This is possible, but not necessarily true, as some donkeys could be happy.\n\n5. **Only donkeys are happy.**\n   - This would imply no humans or monkeys are happy, which is not supported by any given information. It is not a necessary conclusion.\n\n6. **Alfred will run.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Alfred will run. Alfred's running is not directly addressed by the given conditions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n3. Not all donkeys are happy.",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there's at least one of each.\n2. A human chased every donkey that chased it.\n3. No monkeys chased a human that chased it.\n4. Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n5. It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey, which means Lewis is a donkey.\n6. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Lewis is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n7. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n8. Alfred isn't hungry.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Lewis is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel. However, this doesn't directly relate to Hazel chasing Alfred. We can't definitively conclude this option must be true.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Alfred didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - The statement \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred\" is trivially true because an individual cannot chase themselves. However, the first part \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is not necessarily true based on the given information. This option doesn't have to be true.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - This implies that Hazel might have chased Alfred. However, we don't have enough information to conclude that Hazel chased Alfred. This option doesn't have to be true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - We know from the problem statement that \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true. Also, \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" is given, which means \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" is true. Therefore, this option must be true.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.**\n   - The statement \"it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred\" implies Alfred chased Alfred, which is not possible. This option cannot be true.\n\n6. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - We don't have enough information to conclude that no donkeys saw Hazel. This option doesn't have to be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**",

Therefore, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Lewis only if not all donkeys are hungry.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. If not all donkeys are hungry, then not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n5. **If every monkey chased Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.**\n   - This is another conditional statement. If every monkey chased Hazel, then for a human to have chased Hazel, Lewis must be hungry.\n\n6. **Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Lewis drank.**\n   - Alfred is not hungry, and Lewis did not drink.

We need more information to determine this conclusively.\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n   - Hazel cannot drink because Hazel doesn't see Hazel, and only humans drank. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - Since only humans drank and we don't have enough information to confirm Alfred is a human, this statement could be true if Alfred is not a human.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - Lewis did not drink, as stated. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nGiven the information, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**5.

If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis did not chase himself.\n\n5. **A human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel.**  \n   This means a human saw Hazel if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.

If Lewis is a donkey, then the condition of every monkey seeing Hazel is dependent on every human seeing Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Not all monkeys chased Hazel.**  \n   This must be true because we know from statement 2 that no monkeys chased Hazel. Therefore, it is impossible for all monkeys to have chased Hazel.\n\n2. **Hazel chased every monkey.**  \n   There is no information given that supports Hazel chasing any monkey, let alone every monkey. This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n3. **Hazel chased a monkey.**  \n   Similar to statement 2, there is no information to support that Hazel chased any monkey. This statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n4. **Every monkey chased Hazel.**  \n   This is false because we know from statement 2 that no monkeys chased Hazel.\n\n5. **A monkey chased Hazel.**  \n   This is false because we know from statement 2 that no monkeys chased Hazel.\n\n6. **Alfred is a donkey.**  \n   There is no information provided that directly supports or contradicts Alfred being a donkey.

Hazel didn't chase Hazel, and every donkey will run.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - We know from the problem that \"it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey,\" so this part is true.\n   - However, we need to determine if \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true. Since every donkey will run, it is possible that all donkeys chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred\" is true as given.\n   - \"It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey\" implies Lewis is a donkey, which contradicts the given information that Lewis is not a donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred and Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - As discussed, \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is not necessarily true.\n   - \"Lewis is a donkey\" contradicts the given information. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred\" is true.\n   - \"Lewis isn't a donkey\" is consistent with the given information. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.**\n   - We know every donkey will run, so it is unlikely that no donkeys chased Alfred. However, this is a conditional statement.\n   - The antecedent \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is false, which makes the entire conditional statement true regardless of the truth value of the consequent. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement. For it to be true, both parts must have the same truth value.\n   - As before, \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is false, and we don't have information about whether \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is true or false. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the truth of this statement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Statement 4: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- Statement 5: If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n\nFinal answer: Statements 4 and 5 must be true.",

The statement \"Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human\" is only true if Hazel is indeed a human, because if Hazel were not a human, the condition would be false.\n\n5. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n   - \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if.\" Therefore, Alfred doesn't see Hazel if and only if a human saw Hazel. Since Hazel is a human (from point 4), Hazel saw herself, satisfying the condition that a human saw Hazel. Thus, Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n\n6. **A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - \"It is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" means Hazel did chase Hazel. Since Hazel is a human, this doesn't directly affect the monkey's actions or observations.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Every monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - We know a monkey saw every human, and Hazel is a human. Therefore, at least one monkey saw Hazel. However, this doesn't imply every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n2. **Hazel saw every monkey.**\n   - There is no information given that Hazel saw any monkeys, only that Hazel chased every donkey.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - We know at least one monkey saw Hazel, but we don't have information about all monkeys. This statement could be true, but it doesn't necessarily have to be true based on the given information.\n\n4. **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This is false because we know at least one monkey saw every human, including Hazel.\n\n5. **Hazel saw a monkey.**\n   - There is no information given that Hazel saw any monkeys.\n\n6. **A monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - This must be true because a monkey saw every human, and Hazel is a human.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n6. **A monkey saw Hazel.**",

If a human kicked a donkey, that donkey must have kicked the human first.\n\n3. **A human is happy and Lewis didn't kick Alfred.**\n   - This tells us that there is at least one happy human, and Lewis (a human) did not kick Alfred (who could be a donkey, human, or monkey).\n\n4. **If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement.

The problem doesn't provide information about whether donkeys can or cannot see Lewis. Also, Lewis could be a human or a monkey.\n\n2. **Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given information that \"Lewis saw every donkey.\" The statement about Lewis seeing every donkey does not imply that every donkey saw Lewis.\n\n3. **Lewis saw a donkey.**\n   - This must be true because Lewis saw every donkey, as stated in the problem. Therefore, Lewis must have seen at least one donkey.\n\n4. **A donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The problem states that Lewis saw every donkey, but it does not imply that any donkey saw Lewis.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the information given. The problem does not specify whether any or all donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n6. **No donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The problem does not provide information about whether donkeys can or cannot see Lewis.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true given the information is:\n\n**3.

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **A human is happy but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - A human is happy (since every human is happy), but \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is true, making this statement false.\n\n5. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This is a contradiction. If every human is asleep, then it cannot be the case that not all humans are asleep. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - This is also a contradiction. If every donkey will run, then it cannot be the case that not all donkeys will run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3.

Therefore, the statement \"Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" is false because the first part is false.\n\n4. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a monkey ate.**\n   - We know every monkey ate, so \"a monkey ate\" is true.

Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of this statement based on the given information.\n\n5. **Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - The situation explicitly states that every monkey ate and that Hazel saw Alfred.
