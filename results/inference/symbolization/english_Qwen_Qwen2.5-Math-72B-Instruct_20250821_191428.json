This is not possible, so the correct interpretation should be that the sentence is always true if the condition is false, which means the sentence is a tautology.\n\nThe correct formalization should

\u00ac(\u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx))).\n\nBut the original sentence is actually a tautology in a different form: \"If not all donkeys will attack, then every donkey will attack\" is a tautology because it is always true if the condition is false.\n\nSo the correct formalization is: \"If not all donkeys will attack, then every donkey will attack\" is a tautology and can be written as:

Simplify the expression \"\u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Px c)\" using the equivalence between the negation of a universal quantifier and an existential quantifier:\n   - \"\u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Px c)\" is equivalent to \"\u2203x \u00ac(Ox \u2192 Px c)\".\n   - Using the equivalence between \"\u00ac(Ox \u2192 Px c)\" and \"Ox \u2227 \u00acPx c\", we get \"\u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acPx c)\".\n\n4. Substitute this back into the original expression:\n   - \"\u00acNc \u2228 \u00ac\u2200x(Ox \u2192 Px c)\" becomes \"\u00acNc \u2228 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acPx c)\".\n\nTherefore, the formalization of the sentence \"Hazel isn't a human or not all monkeys saw Hazel\" in predicate logic is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\u00acNc \u2228 \u2203x(Ox \u2227 \u00acPx c)}\n\\]",

Identify the variables and their domains:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be a variable representing a monkey.\n   - Let \\( y \\) be a variable representing a human.\n\n2. Use the given abbreviations:\n   - \\( O(x) \\): \\( x \\) is a monkey.\n   - \\( N(y) \\): \\( y \\) is a human.\n   - \\( Q(x, y) \\): \\( x \\) kicked \\( y \\).\n\n3. Express the sentence in English in a form that can be easily translated to predicate logic:\n   - \"There does not exist any monkey \\( x \\) such that there exists any human \\( y \\) that \\( x \\) kicked \\( y \\).\"\n\n4. Translate this into predicate logic:\n   - The existential quantifier \"there exists\" is represented by \\( \\exists \\).\n   - The universal quantifier \"for all\" is represented by \\( \\forall \\).\n   - The negation \"not\" is represented by \\( \\neg \\).\n\n   Therefore, the sentence \"No monkeys kicked a human\" can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\neg \\exists x (O(x) \\land \\exists y (N(y) \\land Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify the expression using the properties of quantifiers and connectives:\n   - The negation of an existential quantifier is a universal quantifier, and vice versa.\n   - The negation of a conjunction is a disjunction of the negations.\n\n   Applying these rules, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\forall x \\neg (O(x) \\land \\exists y (N(y) \\land Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\forall x (\\neg O(x) \\lor \\neg \\exists y (N(y) \\land Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\forall x (\\neg O(x) \\lor \\forall y \\neg (N(y) \\land Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\forall x (\\neg O(x) \\lor \\forall y (\\neg N(y) \\lor \\neg Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n\nHowever, the most straightforward and common way to express this sentence in predicate logic is:\n\\[\n\\neg \\exists x \\exists y (O(x) \\land N(y) \\land Q(x, y))\n\\]\n\nThus, the final formalization of the sentence \"No monkeys kicked a human\" is:\n\\boxed{\\neg \\exists x \\exists y (O(x) \\land N(y) \\land Q(x, y))}",

Identify the components of the sentence:\n   - Alfred is a specific individual, represented by the constant \\(a\\).\n   - \"Every monkey\" is a universal quantifier over the set of monkeys.\n   - \"saw\" is a binary relation between two individuals.\n\n2. Use the given abbreviations:\n   - \\(O(x)\\): \\(x\\) is a monkey.\n   - \\(P(x, y)\\): \\(x\\) saw \\(y\\).\n   - \\(a\\): Alfred.\n\n3. Express the sentence in logical terms:\n   - The sentence \"Alfred saw every monkey\" can be interpreted as \"For every \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is a monkey, then Alfred saw \\(x\\).\"\n\n4. Write the formalization using logical symbols:\n   - The universal quantifier \"for every\" is represented by \\(\\forall\\).\n   - The conditional statement \"if \\(x\\) is a monkey, then Alfred saw \\(x\\)\" is represented by \\(O(x) \\rightarrow P(a, x)\\).\n\nPutting it all together, the formalization of the sentence \"Alfred saw every monkey\" is:\n\\[\n\\forall x(O(x) \\rightarrow P(a, x))\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\forall x(Ox \\rightarrow Pax)}\n\\]",

Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Identify the predicate and the subject:\n   - The subject is \"donkeys.\"\n   - The predicate is \"ate.\"\n\n2. Use the given abbreviations:\n   - \\( M \\): [1] is a donkey\n   - \\( I \\): [1] ate\n\n3. Express the sentence in English in a form that can be easily translated to predicate logic:\n   - \"No donkeys ate\" can be rephrased as \"There does not exist a donkey that ate.\"\n\n4. Translate this into predicate logic:\n   - The existential quantifier \\( \\exists \\) is used to express \"there exists.\"\n   - The negation symbol \\( \\neg \\) is used to express \"not.\"\n\n   Therefore, \"There does not exist a donkey that ate\" can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\neg \\exists x (Mx \\land Ix)\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify the expression using the equivalence between \\( \\neg \\exists x P(x) \\) and \\( \\forall x \\neg P(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\neg \\exists x (Mx \\land Ix) \\equiv \\forall x \\neg (Mx \\land Ix)\n   \\]\n\n6. Apply De Morgan's law to simplify further:\n   \\[\n   \\forall x \\neg (Mx \\land Ix) \\equiv \\forall x (\\neg Mx \\lor \\neg Ix)\n   \\]\n\nThus, the formalization of the sentence \"No donkeys ate\" in predicate logic is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\forall x (\\neg Mx \\lor \\neg Ix)}\n\\]",

Identify the logical components:\n   - \"A monkey is hungry\" can be written as \\( Lx \\) where \\( x \\) is a monkey.\n   - \"Every donkey will attack\" can be written as \\( \\forall y (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\).\n\n2. Translate the sentence into logical form:\n   - The sentence \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey will attack\" becomes \"If it is not the case that every donkey will attack, then a monkey is hungry.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is \\( \\neg \\forall y (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\rightarrow Lx \\).\n\n3. Simplify the negation of the universal quantifier:\n   - The negation of \\( \\forall y (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\) is \\( \\exists y \\neg (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\).\n   - Using the equivalence \\( \\neg (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\equiv My \\land \\neg Gy \\), we get \\( \\exists y (My \\land \\neg Gy) \\).\n\n4. Substitute back into the logical form:\n   - The sentence now becomes \\( \\exists y (My \\land \\neg Gy) \\rightarrow Lx \\).\n\n5. Since the sentence is about a monkey in general, we can use a variable \\( x \\) and a quantifier to indicate that there exists a monkey that is hungry if there exists a donkey that will not attack:\n   - The final formalization is \\( \\exists y (My \\land \\neg Gy) \\rightarrow \\exists x (Ox \\land Lx) \\).\n\nTherefore, the formalization of the sentence \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey will attack\" is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\exists y (My \\land \\neg Gy) \\rightarrow \\exists x (Ox \\land Lx)}\n\\]",
