So Zindle is either a tove or a borogove.\n\nLet's determine what Zindle is:\n- If Zindle were a rath, it couldn't be galumphed over by a rath (as established)\n- If Zindle were a tove, it wouldn't whiffle (since only borogoves whiffle)\n- If Zindle were a borogove, it could whiffle (since only borogoves whiffle)\n\nNow, let's check each statement:\n\n1. \"Zindle and Bungo will whiffle\" - This would require both to be borogoves. We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n\n2. \"Zindle won't whiffle\" - This would be true if Zindle is a tove or a rath, but we haven't confirmed Zindle's type yet.\n\n3. \"Zindle gyred and only borogoves will whiffle\" - We know Zindle gyred and we know only borogoves will whiffle. This statement is true.\n\n4. \"Zindle gyred and not all borogoves will whiffle\" - We know Zindle gyred, but we don't know if all borogoves will whiffle.\n\n5. \"Zindle gyred and no borogoves will whiffle\" - This contradicts \"only borogoves will whiffle\" which implies at least some borogoves will whiffle.\n\n6. \"Zindle will whiffle\" - This would be true only if Zindle is a borogove, which we haven't confirmed.\n\nThe final answer is: Statement 3 must be true - \"Zindle gyred and only borogoves will whiffle.\"",

The first implies some toves chortled at Bungo, while the second states no toves did. I'll assume this is a typo and the intended statement is \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo and SOME toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. \"Every tove chortled at a rath\" - Nothing in the premises directly addresses this.\n\n2. \"A tove chortled at every rath\" - Nothing in the premises directly addresses this.\n\n3. \"No raths chortled at every tove\" - We know no raths chortled at ANY tove, so it's impossible for a rath to chortle at EVERY tove. This must be true.\n\n4. \"No toves chortled at every rath\" - Nothing in the premises directly addresses this.\n\n5. \"Every tove chortled at every rath\" - Nothing in the premises directly addresses this.\n\n6. \"A tove chortled at a rath\" - Nothing in the premises directly addresses this.\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is statement 3: \"No raths chortled at every tove.\"\n\nFinal answer: Statement 3 must be true.",

We only know that raths don't galumph over borogoves. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. \"Every borogove galumphed over every rath.\"\n   This is a stronger claim than #1, and we have no information requiring all borogoves to galumph over all raths. Not necessarily true.\n\n3. \"A borogove galumphed over a rath.\"\n   We know there's at least one borogove and at least one rath, but nothing requires any borogove to galumph over any rath. Not necessarily true.\n\n4. \"No borogoves galumphed over every rath.\"\n   This statement claims no borogove galumphed over all raths. We don't have information to determine this. Not necessarily true.\n\n5. \"There is not a borogove that every rath galumphed over.\"\n   This is equivalent to \"No borogove was galumphed over by every rath.\" Since we know \"No raths galumphed over a borogove,\" it means no rath galumphed over any borogove. Therefore, it's impossible for every rath to galumph over a borogove. This statement must be true.\n\n6. \"A borogove galumphed over every rath.\"\n   Nothing requires any borogove to galumph over all raths. Not necessarily true.\n\nMy final answer: Statement 5 is the only statement that must be true in this situation.",

So it's false that \"not all\" did this; actually none did.\n\n2. \"A tove galumphed over Bungo.\"\n   This contradicts \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\n3. \"Zindle is uffish.\"\n   First, we need to determine what Zindle is. Since everything is either a tove, borogove, or rath, Zindle must be one of these.\n   \n   A borogove is uffish if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   We don't have direct information about whether toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   \n   However, we know that \"Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This means Zindle cannot be a borogove (as nothing can snicker-snack itself based on the context).\n   \n   So Zindle is either a tove or a rath, but we don't have enough information to determine if Zindle is uffish.\n\n4. \"Every tove galumphed over Bungo.\"\n   This contradicts \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\n5. \"Bungo galumphed over a tove.\"\n   We don't have information about whether Bungo galumphed over anything.\n\n6. \"Bungo galumphed over every tove.\"\n   Again, we don't have information about whether Bungo galumphed over anything.\n\nLooking at statement 1 more carefully: \"Not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" would be true if some toves did and some didn't.

The correct statement would be \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\nFinal answer: Statement 1 \"Not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" must be true, as it's the logical equivalent of saying \"It is not the case that all toves galumphed over Bungo,\" which is true when no toves galumphed over Bungo.",

We know no toves chortled at Bungo, but they might have chortled at other borogoves.\n\n5. \"No toves chortled at every borogove\" - This is true.

If Zindle were a tove, then Zindle would have galumphed over Rafin, contradicting the statement that no toves galumphed over Rafin.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. \"Zindle and Bungo are uffish\" - We only know that at least one of them is uffish, not necessarily both. This might be false.\n\n2. \"Zindle isn't uffish\" - We don't know whether Zindle is uffish or not. This might be false.\n\n3. \"Zindle is a tove\" - We deduced that Zindle cannot be a tove.

This might be false.\n\nThe final answer is: Statement 4, \"Zindle isn't a tove,\" must be true.",
