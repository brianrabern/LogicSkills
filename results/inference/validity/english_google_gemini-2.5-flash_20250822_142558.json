            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Donkey-Monkey Sightings:** Every donkey saw a monkey. (For every d in D, there exists an m in M such that d saw m).\n4.  **Human-Human-Donkey Sightings:** A human saw a human that saw a donkey. (There exists h1 in H, such that h1 saw h2 in H, and h2 saw d in D).\n5.  **Hazel's Identity:** Hazel is a human (from \"Hazel saw a human\").\n6.  **Hazel & Alfred:** Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n7.  **Lewis & Alfred:** It is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred. (Lewis did not see Alfred).\n8.  **Monkey-Human Chasing:** Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel. (This is a biconditional: (For every m in M, m chased Hazel) IFF (For every h in H, h chased Hazel)).\n\n**Analysis of the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 1: Every donkey saw every monkey.**\n*   This means: For every d in D, and for every m in M, d saw m.\n*   From point 3, we know \"Every donkey saw *a* monkey.\" This means for each donkey, there's *at least one* monkey it saw. It does *not* imply that it saw *all* monkeys.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: No donkeys saw a monkey.**\n*   This means: For every d in D, and for every m in M, d did not see m. Or, there is no donkey that saw any monkey.\n*   This directly contradicts point 3: \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 3: There is a donkey that every monkey saw.**\n*   This means: There exists a d in D, such that for every m in M, m saw d.\n*   The given information (point 3) is about donkeys seeing monkeys, not monkeys seeing donkeys. It also doesn't specify *which* monkey was seen by *which* donkey, or if a single donkey was seen by all monkeys.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: A donkey saw a monkey.**\n*   This means: There exists a d in D, and there exists an m in M, such that d saw m.\n*   From point 3, \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\" Since there is at least one donkey (point 2), it follows that *at least one* donkey saw *at least one* monkey.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey saw every monkey.**\n*   This means: There exists a d in D, such that for every m in M, d saw m.\n*   From point 3, \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\" This means each donkey saw *some* monkey, but not necessarily *all* monkeys. It's possible that Donkey A saw Monkey 1, and Donkey B saw Monkey 2, and no single donkey saw both.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: No donkeys saw every monkey.**\n*   This means: For every d in D, it is not the case that d saw every monkey. (i.e., for every d in D, there exists an m in M such that d did not see m).\n*   This is the negation of Statement 5. Since Statement 5 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this. It's possible that one donkey *did* see every monkey, or it's possible that no donkey did.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

Lewis is a donkey.**\n    *   We have no information about Lewis's species. Lewis could be a donkey, human, or monkey. This statement *might* be true, but it doesn't *have* to be true.\n\n*   **2. Lewis chased every donkey.**\n    *   We know \"No donkeys chased Lewis.\" This is about donkeys chasing Lewis, not Lewis chasing donkeys. We have no information about Lewis's actions towards donkeys. This statement doesn't *have* to be true.\n\n*   **3. Lewis chased a donkey.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about Lewis's actions towards donkeys. This statement doesn't *have* to be true.\n\n*   **4. Not all donkeys chased Lewis.**\n    *   From statement 3 (\"No donkeys chased Lewis\"), we know that *zero* donkeys chased Lewis. If zero donkeys chased Lewis, then it is certainly true that \"not all donkeys chased Lewis\" (because if all donkeys chased Lewis, then at least one donkey would have chased Lewis, which contradicts the given information).\n    *   This statement *must* be true.\n\n*   **5. Every donkey chased Lewis.**\n    *   This directly contradicts statement 3 (\"No donkeys chased Lewis\"). If no donkeys chased Lewis, then it's impossible for every donkey to have chased Lewis. This statement *must* be false.\n\n*   **6. A donkey chased Lewis.**\n    *   This also directly contradicts statement 3 (\"No donkeys chased Lewis\"). If no donkeys chased Lewis, then it's impossible for *a* donkey (meaning at least one donkey) to have chased Lewis. This statement *must* be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information \"No donkeys chased Lewis,\" only statement 4 is necessarily true.\n\nThe information about Hazel, monkeys kicking themselves, and humans chasing donkeys is extra information that doesn't directly impact the truth value of the statements related to donkeys chasing Lewis.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There is at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Donkey Kicked by Humans:** There is a donkey (let's call it Donkey X) that every human kicked.\n4.  **Lewis's Actions (Conditional):** If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then (not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel).\n5.  **Lewis Sighted:** A human saw Lewis.\n6.  **Sleeping:** Only donkeys are asleep.\n\n**Analysis of Key Elements:**\n\n*   **Lewis:** From \"A human saw Lewis,\" Lewis must be something that can be seen. Since everything is D, H, or M, Lewis is one of these.\n    *   If Lewis is a human, then a human saw a human.\n    *   If Lewis is a donkey, then a human saw a donkey.\n    *   If Lewis is a monkey, then a human saw a monkey.\n*   **Lewis didn't chase Lewis:** This is a self-referential statement. It's highly unlikely for Lewis to chase himself in a literal sense, especially if Lewis is an animal. If Lewis is a human, it's still an odd phrasing. Let's assume \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is a true premise for the conditional statement to be evaluated. If Lewis *did* chase Lewis, then the entire conditional statement (point 4) becomes vacuously true, and we learn nothing from it. So, for point 4 to be informative, we assume \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, we must evaluate: (not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel).\n    *   This is equivalent to: (not all donkeys kicked Hazel) $\\implies$ (no monkeys kicked Hazel).\n    *   Or, contrapositively: (no monkeys kicked Hazel) $\\implies$ (not all donkeys kicked Hazel).\n    *   Or, even more simply, using the definition of \"A only if B\" as \"If A then B\":\n        *   Let P = \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\"\n        *   Let Q = \"no monkeys kicked Hazel\"\n        *   The statement is P only if Q, which means P $\\implies$ Q.\n        *   So, (not all donkeys kicked Hazel) $\\implies$ (no monkeys kicked Hazel).\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's go through each numbered statement and determine if it *must* be true.\n\n**1. A human kicked a donkey.**\n    *   From point 3: \"There is a donkey that every human kicked.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one human (point 2), and every human kicked this specific donkey (Donkey X), it means that *a* human (any human) kicked *a* donkey (Donkey X).\n    *   **This statement must be true.**\n\n**2. A donkey kicked a human.**\n    *   We know there are donkeys and humans.\n    *   We know a human kicked a donkey.\n    *   However, there is no information given that implies a donkey *must* have kicked a human. The information is about humans kicking donkeys, not the other way around.\n    *   **This statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**3. Every donkey kicked every human.**\n    *   We know \"There is a donkey that every human kicked.\" This means one specific donkey (Donkey X) was kicked by all humans. It does *not* mean that every donkey kicked every human.\n    *   For example, if there are Donkey A, Donkey B, Human 1, Human 2.\n        *   \"Every human kicked Donkey A\" means Human 1 kicked Donkey A, and Human 2 kicked Donkey A.\n        *   This doesn't tell us anything about Donkey B kicking Human 1 or Human 2, or Donkey A kicking Human 1 or Human 2.\n    *   **This statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**4. Every donkey kicked a human.**\n    *   This means for every donkey, there exists at least one human that it kicked.\n    *   Again, the given information only states that *a specific donkey* was kicked by *all humans*. It provides no information about donkeys kicking humans in general, or every donkey kicking *any* human.\n    *   **This statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**5. A donkey kicked every human.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one donkey that kicked every human.\n    *   Similar to statement 2, the information is about humans kicking donkeys, not donkeys kicking humans. There's no premise that forces a donkey to kick all humans.\n    *   **This statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**6. No donkeys kicked every human.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 5. If statement 5 does not necessarily have to be true, then its negation doesn't necessarily have to be true either.\n    *   We cannot conclude this from the given information. It's possible that no donkeys kicked every human, but it's also possible that one specific donkey *did* kick every human (we just aren't told).\n    *   **This statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**Revisiting the Lewis Conditional (Point 4):**\n\nLet's ensure we haven't missed anything from the Lewis conditional: \"If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nAs established, for this to be informative, we assume \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is true.\nThis means: (not all donkeys kicked Hazel) $\\implies$ (no monkeys kicked Hazel).\n\nThis statement tells us something about the relationship between donkeys, monkeys, and Hazel. However, none of the statements 1-6 involve Hazel or the specific conditions of kicking Hazel. Therefore, this conditional statement, while true, does not help us determine the truth of statements 1-6.\n\n**Revisiting \"A human saw Lewis\" and \"Only donkeys are asleep\":**\n\n*   \"A human saw Lewis\" tells us Lewis exists and can be seen. It doesn't tell us Lewis's species, nor does it impact the kicking relationships between humans and donkeys.\n*   \"Only donkeys are asleep\" tells us about the state of being asleep. It doesn't relate to kicking actions or the relationships in statements 1-6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on a careful analysis of each piece of information, only statement 1 is directly supported and necessitated by the given premises.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

Let D_happy be \"Every donkey is happy\" and M_saw_H be \"All monkeys saw Hazel\". The statement is: D_happy OR (NOT M_saw_H) is false.

The statement is: (NOT H_is_human) => H_is_human.\nIf NOT H_is_human is true, then H_is_human must be true, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the premise (NOT H_is_human) must be false.\nThis means H_is_human must be true.\n**Deduction 1: Hazel is a human.**\n\n**5. \"If Lewis doesn't see Lewis, then Hazel didn't chase Lewis.\"**\nLet L_sees_L be \"Lewis sees Lewis\" and H_chased_L be \"Hazel chased Lewis\".

We know there's at least one human. We don't have information that guarantees any human saw Hazel. For example, if there's only one human (Hazel), and Hazel didn't see herself, then no human saw Hazel.\n\n2.  **Every human saw Hazel.**\n    This is not necessarily true.

If she didn't see herself, she cannot have seen *every* human.\n    **This statement must be false.**\n\n4.  **No humans saw Hazel.**\n    We know Hazel is a human. We also know Hazel did not see Hazel. So, at least one human (Hazel) did not see Hazel. This statement claims *no* human saw Hazel. This is possible, but not necessarily true. There could be another human who saw Hazel.\n\n5.  **Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n    We know Hazel is a human. We also know \"Hazel did not see Hazel\" (Deduction 2).\n    If Hazel is a human and Hazel did not see Hazel, then it is true that not all humans saw Hazel (because Hazel herself, being a human, did not see Hazel).\n    **This statement must be true.**\n\n6.  **Hazel saw a human.**\n    Since Hazel is a human, this means \"Hazel saw herself or another human\". But we know \"Hazel did not see Hazel\" (Deduction 2). So, for this statement to be true, Hazel must have seen *another* human.

If \"Every monkey kicked Hazel\" is true, then \"Not all monkeys kicked Hazel\" is false. If \"Every monkey kicked Hazel\" is false, then \"Not all monkeys kicked Hazel\" is true. Since we don't know if *every* monkey kicked Hazel, we cannot definitively say this is true. For example, if there's only one monkey, and it kicked Hazel, then \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" is true, \"Every monkey kicked Hazel\" is true, and \"Not all monkeys kicked Hazel\" is false.

(This implies that for every human, there exists at least one donkey that chased them. It *doesn't* mean one specific donkey chased all humans, but rather that for any human you pick, some donkey chased them.)\n4.  **Donkey Happiness/Alfred:** (Every donkey is happy) OR (Every donkey chased Alfred). Let's denote \"Every donkey is happy\" as P and \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" as Q. So, P OR Q.\n5.  **Donkey Happiness/Alfred (Negation):** (No donkeys are happy) OR (Every donkey chased Alfred). Let's denote \"No donkeys are happy\" as R. So, R OR Q.\n\n**Analyzing Statements 4 and 5:**\n\n*   **Statement 4: Alfred chased a donkey.** We have no information about Alfred chasing anything. We only know about donkeys chasing humans. So, we cannot conclude this.\n*   **Statement 5: Alfred is happy.** We have no information about Alfred's emotional state. So, we cannot conclude this.\n*   **Statement 6: Alfred chased every donkey.** Similar to statement 4, we have no information about Alfred chasing anything. So, we cannot conclude this.\n\n**Focusing on Statements 1, 2, and 3 using P, Q, R:**\n\nWe have two crucial logical statements:\n(1) P OR Q\n(2) R OR Q\n\nWhere:\n*   P = \"Every donkey is happy\"\n*   Q = \"Every donkey chased Alfred\"\n*   R = \"No donkeys are happy\"\n\nNotice that R is the negation of P. If P is true, then R is false. If P is false, then R is true. So, R is equivalent to NOT P.\n\nLet's substitute NOT P for R in the second statement:\n(1) P OR Q\n(2) (NOT P) OR Q\n\nNow, let's analyze these two statements together.\n\n*   **Case 1: Q is true.** If \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" (Q) is true, then both (P OR Q) and ((NOT P) OR Q) are true, regardless of whether P is true or false.\n*   **Case 2: Q is false.** If \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" (Q) is false, then for (P OR Q) to be true, P must be true. And for ((NOT P) OR Q) to be true, (NOT P) must be true.\n    *   So, if Q is false, then P must be true AND (NOT P) must be true. This is a contradiction (P and NOT P cannot both be true simultaneously).\n\nSince Case 2 leads to a contradiction, it must be that Case 1 is the only possibility. Therefore, Q must be true.\n\n**Conclusion:** \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" (Q) must be true.\n\n**Evaluating the options based on Q being true:**\n\n*   **1. Every donkey chased Alfred.** This is exactly Q, which we determined must be true.\n*   **2. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.** This is the negation of Q. Since Q must be true, its negation must be false. So, this statement must be false.\n*   **3. No donkeys chased Alfred.** This implies that for every donkey, it did *not* chase Alfred. This is a stronger statement than \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" but also contradicts \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\" So, this statement must be false.\n\nTherefore, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

A donkey doesn't necessarily chase itself.\n        *   If Alfred is a Donkey, then \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" (Statement 4) is consistent (e.g., Alfred didn't chase himself, or other donkeys didn't chase him).\n        *   So, Alfred being a Donkey and asleep is *possible*.\n\n        *   Assume Alfred is NOT asleep.\n        *   If Alfred is not asleep, he could be a Donkey or a Monkey (since only donkeys *can* be asleep).\n        *   If Alfred is a Donkey and not asleep, this is consistent.\n        *   If Alfred is a Monkey and not asleep, this is consistent.\n\n    *   We need something that *forces* Alfred to be asleep or not asleep.\n    *   The only statement linking sleep to anything else is (5) \"Only donkeys are asleep.\" and (3) \"No humans are asleep only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\"\n\n    *   Let's re-examine the options based on what we've definitively proven:\n        *   **Alfred isn't a human.** (Proven true)\n\nLet's check the other options to see if they *must* be true.\n\n*   **1. Alfred isn't a human.**\n    *   As shown above: If Alfred were a human, then by \"Every donkey chased every human,\" all donkeys would have chased Alfred. This contradicts \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\" Therefore, Alfred cannot be a human. **This must be true.**\n\n*   **2. Alfred is asleep.**\n    *   We know Alfred isn't a human. So Alfred is either a Donkey or a Monkey.\n    *   If Alfred is a Monkey, then by \"Only donkeys are asleep,\" Alfred cannot be asleep.\n    *   We don't have any information that forces Alfred to be a Donkey, nor do we have information that forces him to be asleep if he is a Donkey.\n    *   Therefore, Alfred being asleep is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **3. Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n    *   We know Lewis is a Donkey. Lewis *could* be asleep, but we don't know for sure.\n    *   We don't know if Alfred is asleep.\n    *   Therefore, this is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **4. Alfred is a human.**\n    *   This is the opposite of what we proved. **This must be false.**\n\n*   **5. Lewis is asleep.**\n    *   We know Lewis is a Donkey. Donkeys *can* be asleep (\"Only donkeys are asleep\").\n    *   However, the statement \"Only donkeys are asleep\" does not mean *all* donkeys are asleep, or that *any specific* donkey (like Lewis) is asleep. It just means non-donkeys aren't.\n    *   We have no information that forces Lewis to be asleep.\n    *   Therefore, Lewis being asleep is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **6. Alfred isn't asleep.**\n    *   We know Alfred isn't a human. So Alfred is either a Donkey or a Monkey.\n    *   If Alfred is a Monkey, then he isn't asleep.\n    *   If Alfred is a Donkey, he *could* be asleep or not asleep.\n    *   Since we don't know if Alfred is a Monkey or a Donkey, we cannot definitively say he isn't asleep.\n    *   Therefore, Alfred isn't asleep is not necessarily true.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information is that Alfred isn't a human.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

So, this is **false**.\n\n2.  **Only humans will run and not all humans will run.**\n    *   \"Only humans will run\" means: If something runs, it's a human. (\u2200x R(x) \u2192 H(x))\n    *   \"not all humans will run\" means: \u2203h \u00acR(h).\n    *   From \u00ac\u2203h R(h), we know that no human will run. This means \u2203h \u00acR(h) is true (since there's at least one human, and that human won't run).\n    *   However, if no human will run, then it's impossible for *only* humans to run, because nothing will run at all. If nothing runs, then the premise \"If something runs...\" is false, making the implication \"Only humans will run\" vacuously true.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate \"Only humans will run\". If \u00ac\u2203h R(h), then no human runs. If no human runs, then no one runs. If no one runs, then it's vacuously true that \"If something runs, it's a human\" because nothing runs.\n    *   So, \"Only humans will run\" is true if no one runs.\n    *   \"not all humans will run\" is true because no human will run.\n    *   Therefore, \"Only humans will run AND not all humans will run\" is **true**.\n\n3.  **Only humans will run.**\n    *   As discussed above, if no one runs (which is implied by \"no humans will run\" and the fact that only humans, donkeys, and monkeys exist, and the problem doesn't state donkeys or monkeys *will* run), then \"Only humans will run\" is vacuously true.\n    *   Let's be precise: \"Only humans will run\" means: $\\forall x (R(x) \\rightarrow H(x))$.\n    *   We know $\\neg \\exists h R(h)$, which means $\\forall h \\neg R(h)$.\n    *   If no human runs, does anything else run? The problem doesn't say. However, if *nothing* runs, then $\\forall x \\neg R(x)$, which implies $\\forall x (R(x) \\rightarrow H(x))$ is vacuously true.\n    *   If something *else* runs (e.g., a donkey runs), then \"Only humans will run\" would be false.\n    *   The statement \"no humans will run\" (\u00ac\u2203h R) does *not* imply that nothing else runs. It only implies that no human runs.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot definitively say \"Only humans will run\" is true. For example, a donkey *could* run, in which case \"Only humans will run\" would be false.\n    *   So, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n4.  **Only humans will run and no humans will run.**\n    *   \"no humans will run\" is given as true.\n    *   \"Only humans will run\" is vacuously true if nothing runs. If something *else* runs (e.g., a donkey), then \"Only humans will run\" is false.\n    *   Since we don't know if anything else runs, we cannot definitively say \"Only humans will run\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n5.  **Not all humans will run.** (\u2203h \u00acR(h))\n    *   We are given \"no humans will run\" (\u00ac\u2203h R(h)).\n    *   This means that for every human, that human will not run.\n    *   Since there is at least one human (given in point 2), and that human will not run, it is true that \"not all humans will run.\"\n    *   So, this statement is **true**.\n\n6.  **A human will run.** (\u2203h R(h))\n    *   This directly contradicts \"no humans will run\" (\u00ac\u2203h R(h)). So, this is **false**.\n\n**Revisiting Option 2 vs. Option 5:**\n\n*   Option 5: \"Not all humans will run.\" This is directly implied by \"no humans will run\" and the existence of at least one human. This *must* be true.\n\n*   Option 2: \"Only humans will run and not all humans will run.\"\n    *   \"not all humans will run\" is true (as established for Option 5).\n    *   \"Only humans will run\" means $\\forall x (R(x) \\rightarrow H(x))$.\n    *   If no human runs ($\\forall h \\neg R(h)$), then for this statement to be true, it must also be the case that no donkey runs ($\\forall d \\neg R(d)$) and no monkey runs ($\\forall m \\neg R(m)$).\n    *   The problem states \"no humans will run\". It does *not* state that no donkeys or no monkeys will run.\n    *   Therefore, \"Only humans will run\" is *not necessarily true*. If a donkey runs, then \"Only humans will run\" is false.\n    *   Since one part of the conjunction is not necessarily true, the entire conjunction (Option 2) is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information, specifically \"no humans will run\" and the existence of at least one human, is \"Not all humans will run.\"\n\nThe other parts of the problem (chasing, Hazel, Lewis, Alfred) are distractors for this specific question about running.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

P6 has a similar structure, but it involves \"seeing Lewis\" and \"donkeys kicking Hazel,\" not \"chasing Lewis.\"\n\n**Statement 2: Hazel didn't chase Alfred and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.**\nThis is: (\u00ac(Hazel chases Alfred)) \u2227 (\u00ac(\u2200m \u2208 M, m kicks Lewis))\n*   From P1: Hazel didn't chase Alfred. (True)\n*   From P3: Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.

We don't have enough information to directly prove or disprove this.\n\n**Statement 5: If every monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.**\nThis is: (\u2200m \u2208 M, m chases Hazel) \u2192 (\u00ac(Alfred kicks Hazel) \u2192 (\u2200m \u2208 M, m kicks Lewis))\nWe know from P3 that (\u2200m \u2208 M, m kicks Lewis) is false.\nSo, the consequent of the inner implication (\u00ac(Alfred kicks Hazel) \u2192 (\u2200m \u2208 M, m kicks Lewis)) is (\u00ac(Alfred kicks Hazel) \u2192 False).\nFor this inner implication to be true, (\u00ac(Alfred kicks Hazel)) must be false, meaning (Alfred kicks Hazel) must be true.\nSo, the statement simplifies to: (\u2200m \u2208 M, m chases Hazel) \u2192 (Alfred kicks Hazel).\nWe don't have enough information to determine if this must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Lewis didn't chase Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\nThis is: (\u00ac(Lewis chases Hazel)) \u2227 (\u2203m \u2208 M, m kicks Alfred)\n*   From P4: Lewis didn't chase Hazel. (True)\n*   We need to determine if (\u2203m \u2208 M, m kicks Alfred) must be true.\n    Let's look at P5: (\u2203h \u2208 H, \u00ac(h kicks Alfred)) \u2194 (\u2200m \u2208 M, \u00ac(m sees Alfred)).\n    This tells us about humans kicking Alfred and monkeys seeing Alfred, not monkeys kicking Alfred.\n    We cannot deduce from the given premises whether \"a monkey kicked Alfred\" is true or false.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze each statement.\n\n**Definitions and Given Information:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a Donkey (D), Human (H), or Monkey (M).\n*   **Existence:** There is at least one of each (D, H, M).\n*   **Human-Human Sight:** Every human saw every human. (This is a crucial one!)\n*   **Monkey-Donkey Sight:** Every monkey saw every donkey that saw it.\n*   **Human-Monkey Kick (Specific):** A human (let's call him H1) kicked a monkey (M1) that kicked H1. (M1 kicked H1)\n*   **Monkey-Human Kick (General):** A monkey (M2) kicked every human that kicked M2.\n*   **Alfred/Lewis/Hazel Sight:** A human saw Alfred if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's denote the set of humans as $H$, the set of monkeys as $M$, and the set of donkeys as $D$.\n\n**Key Deduction from \"Every human saw every human\":**\n\nThis statement implies that for any two humans $h_1, h_2 \\in H$ (possibly $h_1 = h_2$), $h_1$ saw $h_2$.\n\n*   If there is only one human, say $h_1$, then $h_1$ saw $h_1$.\n*   If there are multiple humans, say $h_1, h_2, h_3$, then $h_1$ saw $h_1, h_2, h_3$; $h_2$ saw $h_1, h_2, h_3$; and $h_3$ saw $h_1, h_2, h_3$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. No humans saw a human that saw it.**\n*   This means: For any human $h_1$, if $h_2$ is a human that $h_1$ saw, then $h_2$ did not see $h_1$.\n*   However, we know \"Every human saw every human.\"\n    *   Let $h_1$ be any human. $h_1$ saw $h_1$. So, $h_1$ saw a human ($h_1$) that saw $h_1$.\n    *   If there are at least two humans, say $h_1$ and $h_2$. $h_1$ saw $h_2$, and $h_2$ saw $h_1$. So $h_1$ saw a human ($h_2$) that saw $h_1$.\n*   Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n**2. No humans saw every human.**\n*   This means: For every human $h$, there is at least one human that $h$ did not see.\n*   However, we know \"Every human saw every human.\" This directly contradicts the statement. Every human *did* see every human.\n*   Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n**3. Alfred is a donkey.**\n*   We are given: \"A human saw Alfred if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\"\n*   This statement tells us about a conditional relationship between two seeing events. It does not provide any information about Alfred's species. Alfred could be a human, a monkey, or a donkey. We have no information to determine Alfred's species.\n*   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**4. There is not a human that every human saw.**\n*   This means: For every human $h_x$, there is at least one human $h_y$ who did not see $h_x$.\n*   However, we know \"Every human saw every human.\" This means that for any human $h_x$, *every* human $h_y$ saw $h_x$.\n*   This statement directly contradicts the given information.\n*   Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n**5. A human saw every human.**\n*   This means: There exists at least one human, say $h_x$, such that $h_x$ saw every human.\n*   We are given \"Every human saw every human.\" This means that *all* humans saw every human. If all humans saw every human, then it must be true that *at least one* human saw every human.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**6. No humans saw a human.**\n*   This means: For every human $h_1$, there is no human $h_2$ such that $h_1$ saw $h_2$.\n*   However, we know \"Every human saw every human.\" This means that every human saw themselves (if there's only one human) or saw other humans (if there are multiple).\n*   This statement directly contradicts the given information.\n*   Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\n*   Statement 1: False\n*   Statement 2: False\n*   Statement 3: Not necessarily true\n*   Statement 4: False\n*   Statement 5: True\n*   Statement 6: False\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 5. The information about kicking and Alfred/Lewis/Hazel is extraneous for evaluating these specific statements, which primarily hinge on the \"Every human saw every human\" rule.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

If Q is true (Alfred doesn't see Lewis), then (Q => R) would be (True => False), which is False.\n*   So, if \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is True, then the entire consequent (Q => R) is False.\n*   If the consequent (Q => R) is False, then for the entire implication (P => (Q => R)) to be true, P must be False.\n*   However, we don't have enough information to determine if \"not all humans are asleep\" (P) is true or false, or if \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" (Q) is true or false.\n*   Let's consider the case where \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is True. Then (Q => R) is (True => False), which is False. In this scenario, for the whole statement to be true, \"not all humans are asleep\" must be False (meaning all humans are asleep).\n*   Let's consider the case where \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" is False (i.e., Alfred sees Lewis). Then (Q => R) is (False => False), which is True. In this scenario, the whole statement (P => True) is True regardless of P.\n*   Since we cannot definitively determine the truth value of \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" or \"not all humans are asleep\", we cannot definitively say this statement must be true. It *could* be true, but it doesn't *have* to be.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep.**\n*   This statement is of the form P OR Q.\n*   P: \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\"\n*   Q: \"a human is asleep\"\n*   We know \"a human saw Lewis\" is true. This means there is at least one human.\n*   We don't know if Alfred sees Lewis or not.\n*   We don't know if any human is asleep or not.\n*   For example, if Alfred sees Lewis (P is False) and no human is asleep (Q is False), then the statement is False. This is a possible scenario.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 5: A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n*   \"A human saw Lewis\" is **True** (given).\n*   \"Alfred isn't asleep\" is **True** (given).\n*   The statement is \"True AND True\", which is **True**.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless a human is asleep.**\n*   \"P unless Q\" is equivalent to \"If not Q, then P\" or \"P or Q\".\n*   So, this statement is equivalent to \"If a human is not asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" or \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep\".\n*   This is the same as Statement 4.\n*   As established for Statement 4, this does not *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Eating:** Only donkeys ate. (This means if something ate, it's a donkey. Conversely, if something is not a donkey, it didn't eat).\n4.  **Human Sight:** A human saw a human that saw a human. (This implies there are at least 3 humans, or at least one human who saw themselves and another human, or a chain of humans seeing each other. The key is that humans can see other humans).\n5.  **Hazel's Sight:** Hazel saw Hazel. (This means Hazel saw herself).\n6.  **Donkey Running:** Not all donkeys will run. (This means there is at least one donkey that will not run).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\n**Statement 1: Hazel didn't eat.**\n\n*   From point 3, \"Only donkeys ate.\"\n*   If Hazel is not a donkey, then Hazel didn't eat.\n*   If Hazel is a donkey, then Hazel ate.\n*   We don't know if Hazel is a donkey yet. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: Hazel won't run.**\n\n*   We know \"Not all donkeys will run\" (point 6). This means there's at least one donkey that won't run.\n*   We don't know if Hazel is a donkey, or if she's the specific donkey that won't run, or if she's a human/monkey.\n*   So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: Hazel ate.**\n\n*   From point 3, \"Only donkeys ate.\"\n*   If Hazel ate, then Hazel must be a donkey.\n*   We don't know if Hazel is a donkey. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Hazel is a donkey.**\n\n*   Consider point 5: \"Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n*   Consider point 4: \"A human saw a human that saw a human.\" This tells us that humans *can* see other humans, and specifically, they can see themselves (as implied by the chain, or directly if one human saw themselves).\n*   Could Hazel be a human? Yes, a human can see themselves.\n*   Could Hazel be a monkey? The problem doesn't state that monkeys can or cannot see themselves. However, the problem *does* state that \"A human saw a human that saw a human.\" This establishes a precedent for self-sight within the human category. If Hazel is a human, then \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is consistent with the properties of humans.\n*   The problem *doesn't* give any information about donkeys or monkeys seeing themselves.\n*   However, the crucial piece of information is \"Only donkeys ate.\" We need to determine Hazel's category.\n*   Let's re-evaluate the implications of \"Hazel saw Hazel.\" This is a statement about self-perception. The only category for which self-perception is explicitly mentioned or implied as possible is \"human\" (\"A human saw a human that saw a human\"). While it doesn't *exclude* donkeys or monkeys from seeing themselves, it doesn't *confirm* it either.\n*   Let's look for a direct link. Is there anything that forces Hazel to be a donkey?\n*   No, there isn't. Hazel could be a human who saw herself.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: Hazel will run.**\n\n*   We know \"Not all donkeys will run\" (point 6).\n*   We don't know if Hazel is a donkey, or if she's one of the donkeys that *will* run, or if she's a human/monkey.\n*   So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: Hazel saw Hazel and only donkeys ate.**\n\n*   This statement is a conjunction of two facts given in the problem description.\n*   Fact 1: \"Hazel saw Hazel\" (given directly in point 5).\n*   Fact 2: \"Only donkeys ate\" (given directly in point 3).\n*   Since both parts of the conjunction are explicitly stated as true in the problem description, the combined statement must also be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 6 is necessarily true because it is a direct restatement of two facts provided in the problem description.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

Let's denote \"saw\" as 'S'. If M1 and M2 are monkeys, then M1 S M2 and M2 S M1. This also implies self-seeing: M1 S M1.\n*   **Monkey Running:** \"Not all monkeys will run.\" This means there is at least one monkey that will not run.\n*   **Hazel:** \"Hazel saw Hazel.\" Hazel could be a donkey, human, or monkey.\n*   **Alfred's Eating Condition:** \"If Alfred ate, then every monkey chased Hazel only if no donkeys ate.\"\n    *   Let A_ate be \"Alfred ate\".\n    *   Let M_chase_H be \"Every monkey chased Hazel\".\n    *   Let D_not_ate be \"No donkeys ate\".\n    *   The condition is: A_ate $\\implies$ (M_chase_H $\\iff$ D_not_ate).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given facts.\n\n**1. No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.**\n*   From \"Every monkey saw every monkey,\" if M1 and M2 are monkeys, then M1 saw M2 and M2 saw M1.\n*   So, M1 saw M2, and M2 saw M1 (meaning M2 is a monkey that saw M1). This directly contradicts the statement \"No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 1 is **False**.\n\n**2. There is not a monkey that every monkey saw.**\n*   From \"Every monkey saw every monkey,\" it means for any monkey M_x, M_x saw every other monkey, and every other monkey saw M_x.\n*   This implies that *every* monkey is a monkey that every monkey saw. For example, pick any monkey M_k. Did every monkey see M_k? Yes, because \"every monkey saw every monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, the statement \"There is not a monkey that every monkey saw\" is **False**. (In fact, *every* monkey is a monkey that every monkey saw).\n\n**3. No monkeys saw every monkey.**\n*   From \"Every monkey saw every monkey,\" it means that for any monkey M_x, M_x saw every other monkey (including itself).\n*   This directly contradicts the statement \"No monkeys saw every monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 3 is **False**.\n\n**4. No monkeys saw a monkey.**\n*   From \"Every monkey saw every monkey,\" it means that if there's at least one monkey (which there is), then that monkey saw another monkey (or itself if it's the only one, but the phrasing implies interaction). If there are multiple monkeys, M1 saw M2.\n*   This directly contradicts the statement \"No monkeys saw a monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 4 is **False**.\n\n**5. Alfred will run.**\n*   The only information we have about running is \"Not all monkeys will run.\" This tells us nothing about Alfred specifically, nor does it tell us if Alfred is even a monkey.\n*   We cannot deduce whether Alfred will run or not.\n*   Therefore, statement 5 is **Cannot be determined / Not necessarily true**.\n\n**6. A monkey saw every monkey.**\n*   The given fact is \"Every monkey saw every monkey.\"\n*   This directly implies that if you pick any monkey (and we know there's at least one), that monkey saw every other monkey (and itself).\n*   Therefore, statement 6 is **True**.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\n*   Statement 1: False\n*   Statement 2: False\n*   Statement 3: False\n*   Statement 4: False\n*   Statement 5: Cannot be determined\n*   Statement 6: True\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is statement 6.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.**\n\n*   This translates to: (No humans are hungry) -> [(Alfred saw Alfred) -> (Every human saw Hazel)].\n*   Let's break it down:\n    *   **Antecedent of the main conditional:** \"No humans are hungry\" - This is given as true.\n    *   **Consequent of the main conditional:** [(Alfred saw Alfred) -> (Every human saw Hazel)]\n        *   **Antecedent of the inner conditional:** \"Alfred saw Alfred\" - This is a tautology (something always true). Everyone sees themselves.\n        *   **Consequent of the inner conditional:** \"Every human saw Hazel\" - We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n*   Since the antecedent of the main conditional (\"No humans are hungry\") is true, the truth of the entire statement depends on the truth of its consequent: [(Alfred saw Alfred) -> (Every human saw Hazel)].\n*   Since \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is true, the truth of the inner conditional depends entirely on \"Every human saw Hazel.\" We don't know if \"Every human saw Hazel\" is true.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement must be true. This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**6. Alfred and Hazel are hungry.**\n\n*   Similar to statement 1, we don't know their species or the hunger status of non-humans.\n*   If either Alfred or Hazel were human, they would not be hungry.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred and Hazel are hungry. This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

It directly tells us that for any individual X, if X is a human, then X saw Alfred.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n*   **1. Alfred saw every human.**\n    *   We know every human saw Alfred. This does not imply the reverse. Alfred could be a rock for all we know from this statement. We have no information about what Alfred saw. So, this is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **2. Alfred saw a human.**\n    *   Similar to statement 1, we have no information about what Alfred saw. So, this is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **3. No humans saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts statement 2 (\"every human saw Alfred\"). So, this is **false**.\n\n*   **4. Alfred is a donkey.**\n    *   We know every human saw Alfred. This doesn't tell us anything about what Alfred is. Alfred could be a human, a monkey, a donkey, or something else entirely (though the problem states everything is one of the three categories). We don't have enough information to determine Alfred's type. So, this is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **5. A human saw Alfred.**\n    *   From statement 2, we know \"every human saw Alfred.\" If there is at least one human (which is guaranteed by the problem statement \"there's at least one of each\"), then it logically follows that *a* human saw Alfred. This statement is a direct consequence of \"every human saw Alfred\" and the existence of humans. So, this is **true**.\n\n*   **6. Not all humans saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts statement 2 (\"every human saw Alfred\"). So, this is **false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information provided, specifically \"every human saw Alfred,\" and the premise that there is at least one human, the only statement that must be true is \"A human saw Alfred.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(This defines the categories of beings).\n*   **Premise 2:** Alfred isn't hungry. (Let's denote this as `~H(Alfred)`).\n*   **Premise 3:** If Alfred will run, then every monkey is hungry only if every human saw Hazel.\n    *   Let `R(Alfred)` be \"Alfred will run.\"\n    *   Let `H(Monkey)` be \"Every monkey is hungry.\"\n    *   Let `S(Human, Hazel)` be \"Every human saw Hazel.\"\n    *   This premise can be written as: `R(Alfred) -> (H(Monkey) -> S(Human, Hazel))`\n*   **Premise 4:** Hazel saw Alfred. (Let's denote this as `S(Hazel, Alfred)`).\n*   **Premise 5:** No humans will run. (This information seems extraneous to the core logical deduction, as it doesn't directly connect to the other premises in a way that forces a conclusion about Alfred or Hazel's running/hunger/seeing status).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nWe need to determine which of the given statements *must* be true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the premises:\n\n*   `~H(Alfred)` (Alfred isn't hungry) - This is a direct fact.\n*   `S(Hazel, Alfred)` (Hazel saw Alfred) - This is a direct fact.\n\nNow let's look at the complex conditional: `R(Alfred) -> (H(Monkey) -> S(Human, Hazel))`\n\nWe know `S(Hazel, Alfred)` is true. This doesn't directly tell us anything about `S(Human, Hazel)`.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for `R(Alfred)`:\n\n**Case 1: Assume Alfred will run (`R(Alfred)` is true).**\nIf `R(Alfred)` is true, then the consequent `(H(Monkey) -> S(Human, Hazel))` must also be true.\nSo, if Alfred runs, then (every monkey is hungry only if every human saw Hazel).\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine if `H(Monkey)` is true or if `S(Human, Hazel)` is true. Therefore, we cannot definitively say if `R(Alfred)` is true or false based on the given information.\n\n**Case 2: Assume Alfred won't run (`~R(Alfred)` is true).**\nIf `~R(Alfred)` is true, then the entire conditional `R(Alfred) -> (H(Monkey) -> S(Human, Hazel))` is true regardless of the truth value of `(H(Monkey) -> S(Human, Hazel))`. This means `~R(Alfred)` is consistent with the premises.\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n1.  **Alfred won't run.** (`~R(Alfred)`)\n    We cannot definitively conclude this. If Alfred *does* run, the premises are still consistent (we just get the implication `H(Monkey) -> S(Human, Hazel)`). We don't have information to force `~R(Alfred)`.\n\n2.  **Alfred and Hazel will run.** (`R(Alfred) AND R(Hazel)`)\n    We cannot conclude `R(Alfred)`, and we have no information about `R(Hazel)`. So, this is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Alfred isn't hungry and Hazel saw Alfred.** (`~H(Alfred) AND S(Hazel, Alfred)`)\n    *   `~H(Alfred)` is directly stated as Premise 2.\n    *   `S(Hazel, Alfred)` is directly stated as Premise 4.\n    *   Since both components are directly stated as true premises, their conjunction must also be true.\n\n4.  **Hazel will run.** (`R(Hazel)`)\n    We have no information about Hazel running. So, this is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **Alfred will run.** (`R(Alfred)`)\n    We cannot definitively conclude this. As discussed in Case 2, Alfred not running is consistent with the premises.\n\n6.  **Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred.** (`~H(Alfred) AND ~S(Hazel, Alfred)`)\n    *   `~H(Alfred)` is true.\n    *   `~S(Hazel, Alfred)` is the negation of Premise 4 (`S(Hazel, Alfred)`), which is true. Therefore, `~S(Hazel, Alfred)` is false.\n    *   Since one part of the conjunction is false, the entire statement is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 3 is directly and necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a donkey (D), or a human (H), or a monkey (M) exclusively.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Rule 1 (Donkeys & Lewis):** No donkeys saw Lewis. (This is a direct and strong statement).\n4.  **Rule 2 (Monkey):** A monkey is happy. (This seems like a distractor for the Lewis-related logic).\n5.  **Rule 3 (Donkeys & Hazel & Lewis):** Every donkey saw Hazel ONLY IF a donkey saw Lewis.\n    *   This can be rephrased as: If every donkey saw Hazel, then a donkey saw Lewis.\n    *   Or, using contrapositive: If no donkey saw Lewis, then not every donkey saw Hazel.\n6.  **Rule 4 (Humans & Donkeys & Lewis):** If not all humans chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n**Analysis based on Rule 1:**\n\nRule 1 states: \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" This is a definitive statement.\n\nLet's see how this impacts other rules and the proposed statements.\n\n*   **From Rule 1:** \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" directly implies that \"a donkey saw Lewis\" is false.\n*   **From Rule 1 and Rule 3 (contrapositive):** Since \"no donkey saw Lewis\" is true, it must be that \"not every donkey saw Hazel\" is true. (This is an interesting deduction but not directly related to the proposed statements about Lewis and donkeys).\n*   **From Rule 1 and Rule 4:**\n    *   Rule 4: If (not all humans chased Lewis), then (not all donkeys saw Lewis).\n    *   We know from Rule 1 that \"not all donkeys saw Lewis\" is true (because *no* donkeys saw Lewis, which is a stronger condition than *not all*).\n    *   This means the consequent of Rule 4 is true. However, this doesn't tell us anything about the antecedent (\"not all humans chased Lewis\"). It could be true or false.\n\n**Evaluating the Proposed Statements:**\n\nLet's use the fact that \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true.\n\n1.  **Lewis saw a donkey.**\n    *   If Lewis saw a donkey, then a donkey saw Lewis.\n    *   But we know \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n2.  **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true.\n    *   If *no* donkeys saw Lewis, then it is certainly true that *not all* donkeys saw Lewis (in fact, zero donkeys saw Lewis).\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **true**.\n\n3.  **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true.\n    *   The second part, \"Lewis isn't a donkey,\" is not directly stated or derivable from the given rules. Lewis could be a human, a monkey, or even a donkey (though if Lewis were a donkey, then \"no donkeys saw Lewis\" would mean Lewis didn't see himself, which is possible, but the statement \"Lewis isn't a donkey\" is not necessarily true).\n    *   Since we cannot confirm \"Lewis isn't a donkey,\" we cannot confirm the entire conjunction.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n4.  **Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n    *   This is the direct opposite of \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"\n    *   Since \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true, \"Every donkey saw Lewis\" must be **false**.\n\n5.  **Lewis saw every donkey.**\n    *   If Lewis saw every donkey, then every donkey was seen by Lewis. This implies that a donkey saw Lewis.\n    *   But we know \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n6.  **A donkey saw Lewis.**\n    *   This is the direct opposite of \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"\n    *   Since \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true, \"A donkey saw Lewis\" must be **false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct statement \"No donkeys saw Lewis,\" only statement 2 is necessarily true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

This is not necessarily true.\n*   \"Only humans will run\" means: $\\forall x, R(x) \\implies x \\in H$.\n*   Since we know $\\forall h \\in H, \\neg R(h)$, this means that if anyone runs, they cannot be human.\n*   So, if \"only humans will run\" were true, and \"no humans will run\" is true, then it implies that no one runs at all. We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 4: A human will attack and no humans will attack.**\n*   This statement is a contradiction: (P $\\land \\neg$ P).\n*   A statement that is a contradiction cannot be true.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Option 5: Lewis ate and no humans will run.**\n*   We deduced \"Lewis ate\" directly from statement 3. (A(Lewis) is true).\n*   We deduced \"no humans will run\" directly from statement 4. ($\\forall h \\in H, \\neg R(h)$ is true).\n*   Since both conjuncts are true, their conjunction must be true.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Option 6: Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n*   We know \"No humans will run.\" If Alfred or Hazel is a human, then this part is false.\n*   We don't know Alfred's species.\n*   We don't know Hazel's species, but if Hazel is a human, she won't run.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(This means for every donkey 'd', there exists at least one donkey 'd'' such that 'd' kicked 'd'').\n4.  **Conditional Rule:** If every monkey is asleep (A_M), then (Hazel kicked Alfred (H_kA) only if no monkeys kicked Hazel (M_kH)).\n5.  **Donkey Running Rule:** Not all donkeys will run. (This means there is at least one donkey that will not run).\n6.  **Monkey Kicking Rule:** A monkey kicked Alfred. (This means there exists at least one monkey 'm' such that 'm' kicked Alfred).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements based on \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\"**\n\nThe crucial piece of information for these statements is: \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\"\n\nLet's represent the set of donkeys as D.\nThe statement means: For every $d \\in D$, there exists some $d' \\in D$ such that $d$ kicked $d'$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **1. No donkeys kicked a donkey.**\n    This directly contradicts the given information \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\" If every donkey kicked a donkey, then it's impossible that *no* donkeys kicked a donkey.\n    *   **False.**\n\n*   **2. A donkey kicked every donkey.**\n    This means there exists at least one donkey $d_0$ such that for every donkey $d'$, $d_0$ kicked $d'$.\n    The given information \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" only states that *each* donkey kicked *at least one* donkey. It doesn't say that *one specific* donkey kicked *all* donkeys.\n    *   **Not necessarily true.** (Consider a scenario with two donkeys, D1 and D2. D1 kicked D1. D2 kicked D2. This satisfies \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\", but no single donkey kicked *every* donkey.)\n\n*   **3. A donkey kicked a donkey.**\n    If \"Every donkey kicked a donkey,\" and we know there's at least one donkey (from \"at least one of each\"), then it logically follows that *some* donkey kicked *some* donkey. If there's at least one donkey, say D1, then D1 kicked *a* donkey. Therefore, \"A donkey kicked a donkey\" must be true.\n    *   **True.**\n\n*   **4. There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.**\n    This means there exists at least one donkey $d_0$ such that for every donkey $d'$, $d'$ kicked $d_0$.\n    Again, the given information \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" only states that *each* donkey kicked *at least one* donkey. It doesn't specify *who* was kicked. It's possible that D1 kicked D1, and D2 kicked D2, and no single donkey was kicked by *every* other donkey.\n    *   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **5. Every donkey kicked every donkey.**\n    This means for every donkey $d_1$ and every donkey $d_2$, $d_1$ kicked $d_2$.\n    The given information \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" only states that for every donkey $d_1$, there exists *at least one* donkey $d_2$ that $d_1$ kicked. It doesn't say $d_1$ kicked *all* donkeys.\n    *   **Not necessarily true.** (Using the D1 kicked D1, D2 kicked D2 example, this statement would be false.)\n\n*   **6. No donkeys kicked every donkey.**\n    This means for every donkey $d_1$, it is *not* the case that $d_1$ kicked every donkey. In other words, for every donkey $d_1$, there exists at least one donkey $d_2$ that $d_1$ did *not* kick.\n    The given information \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" only guarantees that each donkey kicked *at least one* donkey. It doesn't preclude the possibility that one donkey kicked *all* donkeys. If there's only one donkey, D1, then D1 kicked D1. In this case, D1 *did* kick every donkey (because D1 is the only donkey). So, \"No donkeys kicked every donkey\" would be false in that scenario. Since the problem states \"at least one of each\", there could be just one donkey.\n    *   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" and \"there's at least one of each\" (which implies there's at least one donkey) is \"A donkey kicked a donkey.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

A donkey saw a human.**\nThis statement claims that there exists at least one donkey and at least one human such that the donkey saw that human.\nFrom (5), we know \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" Hazel is a human. This means for the specific human Hazel, no donkey saw her.\nHowever, this statement doesn't preclude a donkey from seeing *other* humans (if there are any other humans).\nWe know there's at least one human (Hazel).\nIf Hazel is the *only* human, then \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" directly implies \"No donkeys saw a human.\" In this case, statement 1 would be false.\nIf there are other humans besides Hazel, then it's possible a donkey saw one of them.\nThe problem states \"there's at least one of each\" (D, H, M). It doesn't say there's *only one* of each.\nWe cannot definitively say this is true or false based on the given information.\n\n**2. No donkeys saw a human.**\nThis statement claims that for every donkey and every human, the donkey did not see that human.\nFrom (5), we know \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" Since Hazel is a human, this is consistent with \"No donkeys saw a human.\"\nIf this statement were true, it would mean that no donkey saw *any* human, including Hazel.\nIs it *necessarily* true?\nWe know \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" This is a specific instance.\nTo prove \"No donkeys saw a human\" (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, d did not see h), we need to know that no donkey saw *any* human.\nThe information \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" only tells us about Hazel. It doesn't tell us about other potential humans.\nHowever, let's re-read the problem carefully. The problem asks which statement *must* be true.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that statement 2 is false. If statement 2 is false, then \"A donkey saw a human\" (statement 1) would be true.\nIf statement 2 is false, it means there exists at least one donkey (d) and at least one human (h') such that d saw h'.\nBut we are given \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" This means d cannot be Hazel. So h' must be a human *other than* Hazel.\nThe problem does not state that Hazel is the *only* human. So, it's possible there are other humans.\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"No donkeys saw a human\" must be true.\n\nLet's re-examine the implications of \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\nThis means: $\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ did not see } Hz$.\nThis is a direct and absolute statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the options again in light of this.\n\n*   **1. A donkey saw a human.**\n    This means $\\exists d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H \\text{ such that } d \\text{ saw } h$.\n    We know $d \\text{ did not see } Hz$. So if this statement is true, then $h \\neq Hz$.\n    Is it *necessary* that there exists a human $h \\neq Hz$? Not necessarily. Hazel could be the only human.\n    So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **2. No donkeys saw a human.**\n    This means $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ did not see } h$.\n    We are given $\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ did not see } Hz$. This is a part of statement 2.\n    If statement 2 is true, then it implies \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    Does \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" imply \"No donkeys saw a human\"?\n    No. If there are other humans besides Hazel, a donkey *could* have seen one of them, and statement 2 would be false, while \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" would still be true.\n    So, statement 2 is not necessarily true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options very carefully. The key is \"must be true.\"\n\nConsider the given fact: **\"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"**\nLet's represent this formally: $\\forall d \\in D, \\neg (d \\text{ saw } Hz)$.\nSince Hazel is a human ($Hz \\in H$), this means that for the specific human Hazel, no donkey saw her.\n\nNow let's look at the options again:\n\n1.  **A donkey saw a human.** ($\\exists d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H, d \\text{ saw } h$)\n    This statement could be true or false. If Hazel is the only human, then this statement is false because no donkey saw Hazel. If there are other humans, a donkey might have seen one of them. We don't know. So, it doesn't *must* be true.\n\n2.  **No donkeys saw a human.** ($\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, \\neg (d \\text{ saw } h)$)\n    This statement implies \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" However, \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" does not imply this statement. As discussed, if there are other humans, a donkey could have seen them, making this statement false. So, it doesn't *must* be true.\n\n3.  **A donkey saw every human.** ($\\exists d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ saw } h$)\n    If this were true, then there would be a donkey that saw Hazel. But we are given \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    Therefore, this statement **must be false**. So it cannot be true.\n\n4.  **Every donkey saw a human.** ($\\forall d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H, d \\text{ saw } h$)\n    If this were true, then for every donkey, that donkey saw *some* human.\n    This would mean that for every donkey, it saw a human.\n    However, we know \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    If this statement were true, then for every donkey, it must have seen a human *other than* Hazel.\n    Is this necessarily true? No. A donkey might not have seen any human at all. We don't know. So, it doesn't *must* be true.\n\n5.  **Every donkey saw every human.** ($\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ saw } h$)\n    If this were true, then every donkey saw Hazel. But we are given \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    Therefore, this statement **must be false**. So it cannot be true.\n\n6.  **No donkeys saw every human.** ($\\forall d \\in D, \\neg (\\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ saw } h)$)\n    This statement means: For every donkey, it is NOT the case that this donkey saw every human.\n    Let's rephrase: For every donkey, there is at least one human that the donkey did not see.\n    We are given: \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    This means: For every donkey $d$, $d$ did not see Hazel.\n    Since Hazel is a human ($Hz \\in H$), this directly implies that for every donkey $d$, there exists a human (namely, Hazel) that $d$ did not see.\n    This is exactly what statement 6 says: \"For every donkey ($d$), it is not true that ($d$ saw every human).\"\n    This is equivalent to: \"For every donkey ($d$), there exists at least one human ($h$) such that ($d$ did not see $h$).\"\n    And we know that for every donkey $d$, $d$ did not see Hazel. Since Hazel is a human, this condition is met.\n\nTherefore, statement 6 **must be true**.\n\nLet's double check the reasoning for statement 6.\nStatement 6: \"No donkeys saw every human.\"\nThis can be written as: $\\forall d \\in D, \\neg (\\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ saw } h)$.\nUsing quantifier negation, this is equivalent to: $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H, \\neg (d \\text{ saw } h)$.\nIn words: \"For every donkey, there exists at least one human that the donkey did not see.\"\n\nWe are given: \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\nThis means: $\\forall d \\in D, \\neg (d \\text{ saw } Hz)$.\nSince Hazel is a human ($Hz \\in H$), this means that for every donkey $d$, there exists a human (specifically, Hazel) that $d$ did not see.\nThis perfectly matches the logical form of statement 6.\n\nTherefore, statement 6 must be true.\n\nLet's quickly re-verify the others to ensure no misinterpretation.\n\n*   ",

In this case, no donkey chased any monkey, let alone every monkey.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 2: A donkey chased a monkey.**\n\n*   This means: There exists at least one donkey (d) and at least one monkey (m) such that d chased m.\n*   Again, we only know \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\" This doesn't imply the reverse.\n*   It's possible that no donkey ever chased a monkey.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n\n*   This means: For every donkey (d) and every monkey (m), d chased m.\n*   This is a very strong statement and is the reverse of what we know.\n*   We have no information to support this.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 4: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n\n*   This means: There exists at least one donkey (let's call it d1) such that for every monkey (m), m chased d1.\n*   Let's re-read \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\"\n*   This statement says: For every monkey $m_i$ and every donkey $d_j$, $m_i$ chased $d_j$.\n*   This implies that if you pick *any* donkey, *every* monkey chased that donkey.\n*   Let's pick an arbitrary donkey, say Donkey X.\n*   According to \"Every monkey chased every donkey,\" it must be true that every monkey chased Donkey X.\n*   Since there is at least one donkey, let's call it D1.\n*   By the rule \"Every monkey chased every donkey\", it means that for every monkey M, M chased D1.\n*   This perfectly matches the statement \"There is a donkey that every monkey chased\" (namely, D1, or any other donkey for that matter).\n*   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 5: No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n\n*   This means: For every donkey (d), it is NOT the case that d chased every monkey. (i.e., for every donkey d, there exists at least one monkey m that d did not chase).\n*   This is the negation of Statement 1.\n*   Since Statement 1 does not *must* be true, its negation does not *must* be true either. It's possible that some donkey *did* chase every monkey, or that no donkey chased any monkey.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n\n*   This means: For every donkey (d), there exists at least one monkey (m) such that d chased m.\n*   Similar to Statement 2, we have no information about donkeys chasing monkeys.\n*   It's possible that no donkey ever chased a monkey.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(MR $\\lor$ HS)\n4.  **Alfred's State:** Alfred isn't asleep (not AS).\n5.  **Human Running:** No humans will run (not HR).\n6.  **Hazel's Identity:** Hazel is a monkey (HM).\n7.  **Donkey Running:** Every donkey will run (DR).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom (4) Alfred isn't asleep (not AS).\nFrom (5) No humans will run (not HR).\nFrom (6) Hazel is a monkey (HM).\n\nNow let's use these to deduce more.\n\nConsider the \"Monkey/Human Condition\" (MR $\\lor$ HS).\nWe know from (4) that Alfred isn't asleep. If Alfred is a human, then \"a human is asleep\" (HS) might be false.\nWe know from (6) that Hazel is a monkey.\n\nLet's consider the implications of \"No humans will run\" (not HR).\nIf Alfred is a human, then Alfred won't run.\n\nLet's consider the implications of \"Every donkey will run\" (DR).\nIf Alfred is a donkey, then Alfred will run.\n\nLet's consider the implications of \"Hazel is a monkey\" (HM).\nSince Hazel is a monkey, the condition \"Every monkey will run or a human is asleep\" applies.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"Monkey/Human Condition\": Every monkey will run (MR) OR a human is asleep (HS).\n\nWe know Alfred isn't asleep (not AS). This means that if Alfred is a human, then \"a human is asleep\" (HS) is not necessarily true (it depends on other humans). However, if Alfred is the *only* human, then HS would be false. We don't know if Alfred is the only human.\n\nLet's focus on the implications of Hazel being a monkey.\nSince Hazel is a monkey (HM), the condition (MR $\\lor$ HS) must hold true.\n\nNow, let's consider the \"human is asleep\" part (HS).\nWe know Alfred isn't asleep (not AS).\nIf there is *any* human who is asleep, then HS is true.\nIf *no* human is asleep, then HS is false.\n\nLet's assume HS is false (i.e., no human is asleep).\nIf HS is false, then for (MR $\\lor$ HS) to be true, MR (Every monkey will run) must be true.\nIf MR is true, then since Hazel is a monkey, Hazel will run.\n\nWhat if HS is true (i.e., at least one human is asleep)?\nThen (MR $\\lor$ HS) is true regardless of MR. So, we can't definitively say if every monkey will run.\n\nHowever, we have a crucial piece of information: \"Alfred isn't asleep\" (not AS).\nThis means that Alfred is *not* one of the humans (if any) who are asleep.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for Alfred:\n\n**Case 1: Alfred is a Human (H)**\n*   Alfred isn't asleep (given).\n*   No humans will run (given). Therefore, Alfred won't run.\n*   Since Alfred is a human, and Alfred isn't asleep, this doesn't directly tell us if \"a human is asleep\" (HS) is true or false. There could be other humans who are asleep.\n\n**Case 2: Alfred is a Donkey (D)**\n*   Every donkey will run (given). Therefore, Alfred will run.\n*   Alfred isn't asleep (given). This is consistent.\n\n**Case 3: Alfred is a Monkey (M)**\n*   Alfred isn't asleep (given).\n*   The condition (MR $\\lor$ HS) applies.\n    *   If MR is true, then Alfred will run.\n    *   If HS is true, then MR could be false, meaning Alfred might not run.\n\nLet's re-examine the \"Monkey/Human Condition\": Every monkey will run (MR) OR a human is asleep (HS).\n\nWe know Alfred isn't asleep.\nWe know Hazel is a monkey.\n\nConsider the statement \"a human is asleep\" (HS).\nIf HS is true, then (MR $\\lor$ HS) is true. We don't know if monkeys run.\nIf HS is false (meaning *no* human is asleep), then for (MR $\\lor$ HS) to be true, \"Every monkey will run\" (MR) must be true.\n\nLet's try to prove or disprove \"Hazel will run\".\nHazel is a monkey.\nIf \"Every monkey will run\" (MR) is true, then Hazel will run.\nWhen is MR true? MR is true if \"a human is asleep\" (HS) is false.\n\nCan we determine if \"a human is asleep\" (HS) is true or false?\nWe know Alfred isn't asleep. This means Alfred is not a sleeping human.\nHowever, there could be other humans who are asleep.\n\nLet's look at the options.\n\n**Statement 6: Hazel will run.**\n\nLet's assume Hazel will *not* run.\nIf Hazel will not run, then it must be the case that \"Every monkey will run\" (MR) is false.\nIf MR is false, then for (MR $\\lor$ HS) to be true, \"a human is asleep\" (HS) must be true.\nSo, if Hazel won't run, then at least one human is asleep.\n\nCan we definitively say that \"a human is asleep\" (HS) is false? No.\nCan we definitively say that \"a human is asleep\" (HS) is true? No.\n\nThis path seems inconclusive for \"Hazel will run\".\n\nLet's reconsider the initial conditions and deductions.\n\n1.  Alfred isn't asleep.\n2.  No humans will run.\n3.  Hazel is a monkey.\n4.  Every donkey will run.\n5.  Every monkey will run OR a human is asleep.\n\nLet's focus on the \"Every monkey will run OR a human is asleep\" (MR $\\lor$ HS).\n\nWhat if \"a human is asleep\" (HS) is true?\nThen (MR $\\lor$ HS) is true. We don't know if monkeys run.\n\nWhat if \"a human is asleep\" (HS) is false?\nThis means *no* human is asleep.\nIf no human is asleep, then for (MR $\\lor$ HS) to be true, \"Every monkey will run\" (MR) must be true.\nIf MR is true, then since Hazel is a monkey, Hazel will run.\n\nSo, if no human is asleep, Hazel will run.\n\nCan we determine if \"no human is asleep\"?\nWe know Alfred isn't asleep. This doesn't mean no human is asleep.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Alfred is a human.\nIf Alfred is a human, then Alfred isn't asleep.\nAlso, if Alfred is a human, then Alfred won't run (because \"no humans will run\").\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Alfred is a donkey.\nIf Alfred is a donkey, then Alfred will run (because \"every donkey will run\").\nAlfred isn't asleep (given). This is consistent.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Alfred is a monkey.\nIf Alfred is a monkey, then Alfred isn't asleep.\nIf Alfred is a monkey, then (MR $\\lor$ HS) applies.\nIf MR is true, Alfred will run.\nIf HS is true, Alfred might not run.\n\nThis problem seems to hinge on whether \"a human is asleep\" (HS) can be definitively determined.\n\nLet's try to find a contradiction if one of the options is false.\n\n**Consider Statement 6: Hazel will run.**\nAssume Hazel will *not* run.\nIf Hazel will not run, then \"Every monkey will run\" (MR) must be false (since Hazel is a monkey).\nIf MR is false, then for (MR $\\lor$ HS) to be true, \"a human is asleep\" (HS) must be true.\nSo, if Hazel won't run, then at least one human is asleep.\n\nIs it possible for at least one human to be asleep? Yes.\nWe know Alfred isn't asleep, but there could be other humans.\nSo, assuming Hazel won't run doesn't lead to an immediate contradiction with the given information.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"Every monkey will run or a human is asleep.\" This is a disjunction.\n\nLet's consider the implications of \"Alfred isn't asleep\" and \"No humans will run\".\n\nIf Alfred is a human:\n*   Alfred isn't asleep.\n*   Alfred won't run.\n\nIf Alfred is a donkey:\n*   Alfred will run.\n*   Alfred isn't asleep.\n\nIf Alfred is a monkey:\n*   Alfred isn't asleep.\n*   If \"Every monkey will run\" is true, then Alfred will run.\n*   If \"a human is asleep\" is true (and \"Every monkey will run\" is false), then Alfred won't run.\n\nLet's look at the options again.\n\n1.  Alfred isn't asleep but it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey.\n    *   \"Alfred isn't asleep\" is given.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey\" contradicts \"Hazel is a monkey\" which is given. So, this statement is false.\n\n2.  Alfred and Hazel will run.\n    *   We don't know if Alfred will run. (Depends on if Alfred is a donkey/monkey/human).\n    *   We don't know if Hazel will run. (Depends on MR or HS).\n    *   This is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  Alfred won't run.\n    *   If Alfred is a donkey, Alfred will run. So, this is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  Alfred isn't asleep and Hazel is a monkey.\n    *   \"Alfred isn't asleep\" is given.\n    *   \"Hazel is a monkey\" is given.\n    *   Both parts are true. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n5.  Alfred will run.\n    *   If Alfred is a human, Alfred won't run. So, this is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  Hazel will run.\n    *   As discussed, if \"a human is asleep\" (HS) is true, then \"Every monkey will run\" (MR) is not necessarily true, and thus Hazel might not run. We cannot definitively say HS is false.\n    *   Example: Suppose there's a human, Bob, who is asleep. Then HS is true. This means (MR $\\lor$ HS) is true regardless of MR. So, MR could be false, meaning not every monkey runs, and thus Hazel might not run. This scenario is consistent with all given information: Alfred isn't asleep, no",

No.**\n\n**3. There is not a human that every donkey saw.**\n    * This statement can be rephrased as: \"It is not the case that there exists a human 'h' such that every donkey saw 'h'.\"\n    * Or, equivalently: \"For every human 'h', there is at least one donkey 'd' that did not see 'h'.\"\n    * We know \"No donkeys saw a human.\" This means *every* donkey 'd' did not see *every* human 'h'.\n    * If no donkey saw *any* human, then it's certainly true that for any given human, not every donkey saw that human (in fact, no donkey saw that human).\n    * Let's assume, for contradiction, that this statement is *false*. If it's false, then \"There *is* a human that every donkey saw.\" This means there exists a human 'h*' such that for every donkey 'd', 'd saw h*'. But this directly contradicts our given \"No donkeys saw a human.\"\n    * Therefore, \"There is not a human that every donkey saw\" must be true.\n    * **Must be true? Yes.**\n\n**4. A donkey saw a human.**\n    * This means there exists at least one donkey 'd' and at least one human 'h' such that 'd saw h'.\n    * This directly contradicts the given information: \"No donkeys saw a human.\"\n    * **Must be true?

(If d saw h, then h saw d).\n5.  **Hazel's Chase Condition:** If (not all donkeys saw Hazel), then (Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every human saw Hazel).\n    *   Let P = \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\"\n    *   Let Q = \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\"\n    *   Let R = \"Every human saw Hazel\"\n    *   The condition is: P => (Q only if R) which means P => (R => Q).\n    *   So, If (not all donkeys saw Hazel), then (If every human saw Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel).\n\n**Analysis of the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 1: No humans are asleep.**\n\n*   From given information #3: \"Every human is asleep.\"\n*   This directly contradicts statement 1.\n*   Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.\n\n**Statement 2: Hazel is asleep.**\n\n*   We don't know what Hazel is (human, donkey, or monkey).\n*   If Hazel is a human, then Hazel is asleep (from #3).\n*   If Hazel is a donkey or a monkey, we have no information about their sleep status.\n*   Since Hazel *could* be a donkey or a monkey, and we don't know if donkeys or monkeys are asleep, we cannot definitively say Hazel is asleep.\n*   Therefore, Statement 2 is **Not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 3: Not all humans are asleep if and only if a human is asleep.**\n\n*   Let's analyze the two parts of the \"if and only if\" (biconditional):\n    *   **Part A: (Not all humans are asleep) => (a human is asleep)**\n        *   If it's true that \"not all humans are asleep,\" it implies there's at least one human who is not asleep. But it also implies there are humans, and if there are humans, then \"a human is asleep\" must be true (from #3, \"Every human is asleep\").\n        *   However, we know from #3 that \"Every human is asleep.\" This means \"Not all humans are asleep\" is **False**.\n        *   If the antecedent (Not all humans are asleep) is false, then the implication (False => X) is always true, regardless of X. So, (Not all humans are asleep) => (a human is asleep) is true.\n    *   **Part B: (a human is asleep) => (Not all humans are asleep)**\n        *   We know \"a human is asleep\" is **True** (from #3 and #2, \"at least one of each\").\n        *   We know \"Not all humans are asleep\" is **False** (from #3).\n        *   So, this part becomes (True => False), which is **False**.\n*   Since Part B is false, the entire biconditional \"Not all humans are asleep if and only if a human is asleep\" is **False**.\n\n**Statement 4: Only humans are asleep.**\n\n*   We know \"Every human is asleep\" (from #3). This means humans *are* asleep.\n*   However, the statement \"Only humans are asleep\" implies that no donkeys are asleep and no monkeys are asleep.\n*   We have no information about the sleep status of donkeys or monkeys. They *could* be asleep.\n*   Therefore, Statement 4 is **Not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 5: A human is asleep.**\n\n*   From given information #2: \"there's at least one of each\" (including humans).\n*   From given information #3: \"Every human is asleep.\"\n*   Since there is at least one human, and every human is asleep, it logically follows that \"A human is asleep.\"\n*   Therefore, Statement 5 is **True**.\n\n**Statement 6: Not all humans are asleep.**\n\n*   From given information #3: \"Every human is asleep.\"\n*   If every human is asleep, then it is **False** that \"not all humans are asleep.\"\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 is **False**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

It only guarantees a specific human for each donkey.\n*   **Example:** Donkey1 chased HumanA. Donkey2 chased HumanB.

For example, if there's only one human, then every donkey would chase that human. Or, if there are multiple humans, it's still possible for one donkey to have chased all of them. Rule 1 only guarantees *at least one* human for each donkey.\n*   **Example:** If there's only one human (HumanA), then every donkey chased HumanA.

This means for every m1, there exists an m2 such that m1 chased m2 AND m2 chased m1. This implies a symmetric chasing relationship among monkeys.\n*   **Monkey Chasing Rule 2:** A monkey chased Alfred.\n*   **Human Chasing Rule:** Every human chased Alfred.\n*   **Happiness/Lewis/Hazel:** A monkey is happy, but it is not the case that Lewis didn't chase Hazel. This means Lewis *did* chase Hazel. (This information seems largely irrelevant to the monkey chasing dynamics, but good to note).\n*   **Donkey/Hunger Rule:** Every donkey saw Hazel ONLY IF not all donkeys are hungry. (Also seems irrelevant to monkey chasing).\n\n**Analyzing the Monkey Chasing Rules:**\n\nThe crucial rule for the statements is: \"Every monkey (m1) chased a monkey (m2) that chased it (m1).\"\n\nLet's represent the set of monkeys as $M = \\{m_1, m_2, ..., m_k\\}$ where $k \\ge 1$ (since there's at least one monkey).\nLet $C(x, y)$ mean \"x chased y\".\n\nThe rule states: $\\forall m_i \\in M, \\exists m_j \\in M \\text{ such that } C(m_i, m_j) \\land C(m_j, m_i)$.\n\nThis means that for every monkey, there's at least one other monkey (or itself) with whom it has a mutual chasing relationship. This implies that the chasing graph among monkeys consists of only cycles of length 2 (pairs chasing each other) or self-loops (a monkey chasing itself).\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n1.  **There is a monkey that every monkey chased.**\n    *   This means $\\exists m_x \\in M \\text{ such that } \\forall m_i \\in M, C(m_i, m_x)$.\n    *   Consider a scenario with two monkeys, $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n        *   From the rule: $m_1$ chased $m_2$ and $m_2$ chased $m_1$.\n        *   If $m_1$ is the monkey that every monkey chased, then $C(m_1, m_1)$ and $C(m_2, m_1)$. We know $C(m_2, m_1)$ is true. But $C(m_1, m_1)$ is not necessarily true; $m_1$ could have only chased $m_2$.\n        *   If $m_2$ is the monkey that every monkey chased, then $C(m_1, m_2)$ and $C(m_2, m_2)$. We know $C(m_1, m_2)$ is true. But $C(m_2, m_2)$ is not necessarily true; $m_2$ could have only chased $m_1$.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **A monkey chased a monkey.**\n    *   This means $\\exists m_i \\in M, \\exists m_j \\in M \\text{ such that } C(m_i, m_j)$.\n    *   We know there is at least one monkey. Let's call it $m_1$.\n    *   From the rule, $m_1$ chased a monkey ($m_2$) that chased $m_1$. So, $C(m_1, m_2)$ is true.\n    *   Therefore, \"A monkey chased a monkey\" is true.\n\n3.  **A monkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means $\\exists m_x \\in M \\text{ such that } \\forall m_i \\in M, C(m_x, m_i)$.\n    *   Consider the two-monkey scenario again: $m_1$ and $m_2$, where $C(m_1, m_2)$ and $C(m_2, m_1)$.\n    *   If $m_1$ chased every monkey, then $C(m_1, m_1)$ and $C(m_1, m_2)$. $C(m_1, m_2)$ is true. But $C(m_1, m_1)$ is not necessarily true.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **No monkeys chased a monkey.**\n    *   This means $\\neg (\\exists m_i \\in M, \\exists m_j \\in M \\text{ such that } C(m_i, m_j))$.\n    *   This is the direct opposite of statement 2. Since statement 2 is true, this statement must be false.\n\n5.  **Every monkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means $\\forall m_i \\in M, \\forall m_j \\in M, C(m_i, m_j)$.\n    *   Consider the two-monkey scenario: $m_1$ and $m_2$, where $C(m_1, m_2)$ and $C(m_2, m_1)$.\n    *   For this statement to be true, we would need $C(m_1, m_1)$ and $C(m_2, m_2)$ in addition to the given $C(m_1, m_2)$ and $C(m_2, m_1)$.\n    *   The rule \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it\" does not require self-chasing. For example, $m_1$ could chase $m_2$ and $m_2$ chase $m_1$, satisfying the rule for both, without $m_1$ chasing $m_1$ or $m_2$ chasing $m_2$.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means $\\neg (\\exists m_x \\in M \\text{ such that } \\forall m_i \\in M, C(m_x, m_i))$.\n    *   This is the direct opposite of statement 3. Since statement 3 is not necessarily true, this statement is not necessarily true either. It could be true or false depending on the specific configuration of monkeys. For example, if there's only one monkey, $m_1$, then $m_1$ must chase $m_1$ (to satisfy the rule \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it\"). In this case, $m_1$ chased every monkey (itself), so statement 3 would be true, and statement 6 would be false. If there are two monkeys $m_1, m_2$ and $C(m_1, m_2)$ and $C(m_2, m_1)$ are the only chases, then statement 3 is false, and statement 6 is true. So, it's not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 2 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Alfred kicked every donkey.**\n    *   P1 is about donkeys kicking Alfred, not Alfred kicking donkeys. This statement is not necessarily true.\n*   **2. Every donkey kicked Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts P1 (\"No donkeys kicked Alfred\"). Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n*   **3.

Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.**\n    *   P1 states \"No donkeys kicked Alfred.\" This means *zero* donkeys kicked Alfred. If zero donkeys kicked Alfred, then it is certainly true that \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" (because if even one donkey kicked Alfred, then \"not all\" would still be true, but \"no\" is a stronger condition that implies \"not all\").\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **true**.\n*   **5.

The truth of \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" is directly derived from P1, regardless of P5.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must be true* based on the given information, specifically \"No donkeys kicked Alfred,\" is \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

This means that $\\forall x (D(x) \\implies K(x, \\text{Hazel}))$ is false because Lewis is a donkey and Lewis didn't kick Hazel.\nSo, $\\neg (\\forall x (D(x) \\implies K(x, \\text{Hazel})))$ is true.\nTherefore, the consequent of (8), $(\\neg R(\\text{Lewis}) \\implies \\neg (\\forall x (D(x) \\implies K(x, \\text{Hazel}))))$ is true, regardless of $\\neg R(\\text{Lewis})$.\nThis means that statement (8) is always true, regardless of the truth value of $\\neg (\\forall x (D(x) \\implies R(x)))$. It doesn't help us deduce anything new about running.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on what we've definitively established:\n\n*   **Option 5: Lewis didn't kick Hazel.** This is definitively true based on (2) and (5).\n\nLet's check if any other options must be true.\n\n*   **Option 1: Alfred and Lewis will run.** We don't have enough information to determine if Alfred will run or if Lewis will run.\n    *   From (6): $R(\\text{Lewis}) \\lor (\\forall x (D(x) \\implies K(x, \\text{Lewis})))$. Lewis might run, or all donkeys might have kicked Lewis. We don't know which.\n*   **Option 2: Alfred will run.** We have no information about Alfred running.\n*   **Option 3: Hazel kicked Lewis.** We have no information about Hazel kicking Lewis.\n*   **Option 6: Hazel didn't kick Lewis.** We have no information about Hazel kicking Lewis, so we cannot confirm this.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is that Lewis didn't kick Hazel.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Lewis is a donkey (from 5).\n2.  No donkeys kicked Hazel (from 2).\n3.  Since Lewis is a donkey, it follows from (2) that Lewis didn't kick Hazel.\n\nTherefore, statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

It says nothing about donkeys chasing monkeys.\n    *   It's possible that some donkeys were never chased by a monkey, or that some donkeys chased no monkeys.

It introduces specific individuals (Hazel, Lewis) and a complex logical structure that doesn't alter the fundamental implication of \"Every monkey chased a donkey.\"\n\nThe most direct and undeniable consequence of \"Every monkey chased a donkey\" combined with \"there's at least one monkey\" is that \"A monkey chased a donkey.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Yes. For example, if there are three humans (Hazel, Lewis, Bob), and Hazel and Lewis are hungry, but Bob is not.

The condition \"A human is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred\" applies to *humans*, not necessarily to Hazel (who could be a donkey or a monkey, or a human, but we don't know). Even if Hazel were a human, we don't know if \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true. Therefore, we cannot determine if this is true or false.\n\n4.  **Alfred is happy.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about Alfred's happiness.

(This means for every monkey 'm', there exists a human 'h' such that 'm saw h' AND 'h saw m').\n4.  **Alfred's Drinking:** Alfred drank (A_drank) unless every human saw Hazel (H_saw_Hazel). This means: IF NOT (H_saw_Hazel) THEN A_drank. Equivalently: IF A_drank THEN NOT (H_saw_Hazel) OR (H_saw_Hazel). Or, (H_saw_Hazel) OR (A_drank).\n5.  **Monkey's Hunger & Lewis's Happiness:** A monkey is hungry (M_hungry) AND Lewis isn't happy (Lewis_not_happy).\n\n**Analyzing the Monkey-Human Interaction (Crucial Part):**\n\n\"Every monkey saw a human that saw it.\"\n\nLet M be the set of monkeys and H be the set of humans.\nLet 's' denote the \"saw\" relationship.\n\nFor every m $\\in$ M, there exists an h $\\in$ H such that (m s h) AND (h s m).\n\nThis implies a reciprocal seeing relationship.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's consider the implications of \"Every monkey saw a human that saw it.\"\n\n*   Let $m_1$ be a monkey. There exists $h_1$ such that $m_1$ saw $h_1$ and $h_1$ saw $m_1$.\n*   Let $m_2$ be another monkey. There exists $h_2$ such that $m_2$ saw $h_2$ and $h_2$ saw $m_2$.\n    (Note: $h_1$ could be the same as $h_2$, or different).\n\n**Statement 1: A human saw every monkey.**\nThis means there exists *one specific human* ($h_x$) such that for every monkey ($m$), $h_x$ saw $m$.\nDoes the given information guarantee this? No.\nExample: Monkey $m_1$ saw human $h_A$ (who saw $m_1$). Monkey $m_2$ saw human $h_B$ (who saw $m_2$). It's possible $h_A$ did not see $m_2$, and $h_B$ did not see $m_1$. So, no single human necessarily saw *every* monkey.\n\n**Statement 2: Every human saw a monkey.**\nThis means for every human ($h$), there exists *at least one monkey* ($m$) such that $h$ saw $m$.\nDoes the given information guarantee this? No.\nThe condition states that *every monkey* saw a human that saw it. It doesn't say that *every human* was seen by a monkey they saw.\nConsider a human $h_X$ who was not involved in any of these reciprocal seeing relationships. The condition \"Every monkey saw a human that saw it\" would still hold true if $h_X$ simply didn't see any monkeys, and no monkeys saw $h_X$. Since there's at least one human, and at least one monkey, it's possible there's a human who didn't see any monkeys.\n\n**Statement 3: Every human saw every monkey.**\nThis means for every human ($h$) and every monkey ($m$), $h$ saw $m$.\nThis is a very strong statement. The given information only guarantees a *reciprocal pair* for each monkey. It does not imply that all humans saw all monkeys. This is clearly not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: No humans saw a monkey.**\nThis means for every human ($h$) and every monkey ($m$), $h$ did *not* see $m$.\nThis directly contradicts the given information: \"Every monkey saw a human that saw it.\" If a monkey $m$ saw a human $h$ and $h$ saw $m$, then $h$ *did* see a monkey (namely $m$). Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 5: A human saw a monkey.**\nThis means there exists *at least one human* ($h$) and *at least one monkey* ($m$) such that $h$ saw $m$.\nFrom the condition \"Every monkey saw a human that saw it\":\nLet $m_1$ be an arbitrary monkey (we know there's at least one monkey).\nAccording to the condition, there exists a human $h_1$ such that $m_1$ saw $h_1$ AND $h_1$ saw $m_1$.\nSince $h_1$ saw $m_1$, it means that *a human* ($h_1$) *saw a monkey* ($m_1$).\nTherefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: No humans saw every monkey.**\nThis means for every human ($h$), there exists *at least one monkey* ($m$) that $h$ did *not* see.\nThis is the negation of Statement 1. Since Statement 1 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either. It's possible that there *is* a human who saw every monkey (e.g., if there's only one monkey, and a human saw that monkey). Or it's possible that no human saw every monkey. We cannot determine this from the given information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 5 is necessarily true based on the provided information. The other pieces of information (Alfred, Hazel, Lewis, hunger) are distractors for this specific question about human-monkey interactions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This means:\n    *   If X is hungry, then X is a human.\n    *   If X is a human, X *might* be hungry (we don't know if *all* humans are hungry, just that *only* humans can be).\n    *   Donkeys and Monkeys are *never* hungry.\n*   **Monkeys and Lewis:** Not all monkeys kicked Lewis. (This statement seems to be a distractor, as it doesn't directly relate to the categories or hunger of Lewis or Alfred).\n*   **Hazel's Sight:** Hazel doesn't see Hazel. (This is a self-referential statement that doesn't provide direct information about Hazel's category or hunger).\n*   **Lewis's Category:** It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.

We don't know.\n        *   **Case B: No humans *are* hungry.**\n            *   If no humans are hungry, then the condition \"no humans are hungry\" is true.\n            *   This implies that Alfred **isn't a human**.\n            *   If Alfred isn't a human, Alfred must be either a donkey or a monkey.\n            *   If Alfred is a donkey or a monkey, Alfred **cannot be hungry** (because only humans are hungry).\n\n    *   Now, let's consider the overall context: \"There's at least one of each [donkey, human, monkey].\"\n        *   This means there *must* be at least one human.\n        *   If there is at least one human, can \"no humans are hungry\" be true?\n            *   If \"no humans are hungry\" were true, then all existing humans would not be hungry.

This is consistent.\n        *   So, Alfred *could* be hungry (and thus a human).\n\n    *   What if Alfred is *not* a human? Then Alfred is a donkey or a monkey, and therefore not hungry. This is also consistent.\n\n    *   The crucial part is \"Alfred isn't a human unless no humans are hungry.\"\n        *   This means: If there *are* hungry humans, then Alfred *could* be a human.\n        *   If there are *no* hungry humans, then Alfred *cannot* be a human.\n\n    *   We know there's at least one human. We don't know if any of them are hungry.\n\n    *   Let's assume Alfred *is* hungry.\n        *   If Alfred is hungry, then Alfred is a human (by \"only humans are hungry\").\n        *   If Alfred is a human, then by \"Alfred isn't a human unless no humans are hungry\", it must be true that \"some humans are hungry\".\n        *   This is consistent: If Alfred is hungry, then Alfred is a human, and Alfred himself is a hungry human, so \"some humans are hungry\" is true.\n        *   So, Alfred *can* be hungry.\n\n    *   Let's assume Alfred *is not* hungry.\n        *   If Alfred is not hungry, Alfred could be a human (who isn't hungry), a donkey, or a monkey.\n        *   If Alfred is a human (and not hungry), then the condition \"Alfred isn't a human unless no humans are hungry\" means that \"some humans are hungry\" must be true. But Alfred isn't hungry, so some *other* human must be hungry. This is possible.\n        *   If Alfred is a donkey or a monkey, then Alfred isn't hungry. This is also possible.\n\n    *   Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Alfred is hungry or not.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n1.  **Lewis is hungry.**\n    *   Lewis is a donkey. Only humans are hungry. Therefore, Lewis is **not** hungry.\n    *   This statement is **false**.\n\n2.  **Alfred is hungry.**\n    *   As analyzed above, Alfred *could* be hungry (if Alfred is a human and is hungry).\n    *   Alfred *could also not* be hungry (if Alfred is a human but not hungry, or a donkey, or a monkey).\n    *   We cannot definitively conclude that Alfred *must* be hungry.\n    *   This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n3.  **Alfred isn't hungry.**\n    *   As analyzed above, Alfred *could* be hungry.\n    *   We cannot definitively conclude that Alfred *must not* be hungry.\n    *   This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n4.  **Alfred and Hazel are hungry.**\n    *   We don't know if Alfred is hungry.\n    *   We have no information about Hazel's category or hunger status, other than \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" which is irrelevant to her type or hunger.\n    *   This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n5.  **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n    *   We already established that Lewis is **not** hungry.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNone of the provided statements must be true. Let's double-check the reasoning for Alfred.\n\nThe statement \"Alfred isn't a human unless no humans are hungry\" means:\n(Alfred is not a human) OR (no humans are hungry).\n\nWe know:\n*   Only humans are hungry.\n*   There is at least one human.\n\nConsider two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: There is at least one hungry human.**\n    *   In this case, \"no humans are hungry\" is false.\n    *   Therefore, (Alfred is not a human) must be false, which means Alfred *is* a human.\n    *   If Alfred is a human, Alfred *could* be hungry or *not* hungry. We don't know.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: No humans are hungry.**\n    *   In this case, \"no humans are hungry\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, (Alfred is not a human) is true. Alfred is either a donkey or a monkey.\n    *   If Alfred is a donkey or a monkey, Alfred is *not* hungry (because only humans are hungry).\n\nSo, if there's at least one hungry human, Alfred is a human and could be hungry or not.\nIf there are no hungry humans, Alfred is not a human and is not hungry.\n\nSince we don't know if there are any hungry humans, we cannot definitively determine Alfred's hunger status.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{None}$",

But Rule 1 explicitly states that no human chased every monkey. Therefore, Lewis cannot be a human.\n\n* **Conclusion 1: Lewis isn't a human.**\n\n**Analyzing Hazel's Nature and Actions:**\n\nRule 3 states: \"Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel ate.\" This is a conditional statement: $\\neg H(Hazel) \\implies Ate(Hazel)$.\n\nThis statement means:\n* If Hazel is not a human, then Hazel ate.\n* If Hazel is a human, we don't know if she ate or not from this rule alone.\n\nWe don't have enough information to definitively say whether Hazel is a human or not, or whether she ate or not.\n\n**Evaluating the Given Statements:**\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the provided statements based on our deductions:\n\n1.  **Lewis is a human.**\n    *   **False.** We concluded that Lewis isn't a human.\n\n2.  **Lewis didn't eat.**\n    *   **Cannot be determined.** We know Lewis isn't a human, but we have no information about Lewis's eating habits.

This statement says the opposite: no human saw Lewis.\n*   The problem doesn't give us any information about who humans saw, only who Lewis saw.\n*   It's possible that a human saw Lewis, or no human saw Lewis. We cannot determine this from the given information.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Statement 2: Lewis saw a human.**\n*   From point 2, there's at least one human.\n*   From point 4, Lewis saw *every* human.\n*   Since there's at least one human, Lewis must have seen that human (and all others).\n*   **Must be true.**\n\n**Statement 3: A human saw Lewis.**\n*   Similar to Statement 1, we only know Lewis saw humans, not vice-versa.\n*   It's possible a human saw Lewis, or no human saw Lewis.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Statement 4: Not all humans saw Lewis.**\n*   This is the negation of \"Every human saw Lewis\".\n*   From point 4, we are explicitly told \"Lewis saw every human\". This implies \"Every human was seen by Lewis\".\n*   This statement is about humans *seeing* Lewis, not Lewis *seeing* humans.\n*   However, if \"Every human saw Lewis\" were true, then this statement would be false.\n*   We don't know if \"Every human saw Lewis\" is true. We only know \"Lewis saw every human\".\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred is a donkey.**\n*   Alfred is mentioned in several conditional statements (5, 6, 7).\n*   However, we are never told what kind of creature Alfred is. He could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n*   The conditions relate to actions involving Alfred, but not his identity.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Statement 6: Every human saw Lewis.**\n*   This statement is about humans *seeing* Lewis.\n*   The given information (point 4) is \"Lewis saw every human\". This means for any human 'x', Lewis saw 'x'.\n*   This does *not* mean that for any human 'x', 'x' saw Lewis.

It means for any donkey 'x', 'x kicked Hazel' is false.\n5.  **Lewis isn't a donkey.** Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n6.  **A monkey kicked Hazel unless not all donkeys will run.** This is a conditional statement.

She could have, or she could not have.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Statement 2: Lewis will run.**\n*   We know Lewis isn't a donkey (so Lewis is a human or a monkey).\n*   The last rule states \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless not all donkeys will run.\" This links monkey actions and donkey running, but it doesn't directly tell us about Lewis's running.\n*   We don't know if Lewis is a monkey or a human. Even if Lewis is a monkey, we don't know if *that specific monkey* will run.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Statement 3: A donkey kicked Hazel.**\n*   The given information explicitly states: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n*   This statement directly contradicts the given information.\n*   **Must be true? No.** (In fact, it must be false).\n\n**Statement 4: Every donkey kicked Hazel.**\n*   The given information explicitly states: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n*   If \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true, then it's impossible for \"Every donkey kicked Hazel\" to be true.\n*   **Must be true? No.** (In fact, it must be false).\n\n**Statement 5: Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n*   The given information explicitly states: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n*   If \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true, it means that for *every* donkey, it is false that they kicked Hazel.\n*   If no donkeys kicked Hazel, then it is certainly true that \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" (because zero donkeys kicked Hazel, which is less than \"all donkeys\").\n*   This statement is a logical consequence of \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n*   **Must be true? Yes.**\n\n**Statement 6: Hazel kicked every donkey.**\n*   Similar to Statement 1, we have no information about Hazel's actions towards donkeys, let alone *every* donkey.\n*   **Must be true?

A donkey chased every monkey.**\nThis means there exists a donkey $d_0$ such that for all monkeys $m \\in M$, $d_0$ chased $m$.\nDoes our rule \"Every donkey chased a monkey that chased it\" guarantee this? No.\nConsider: Donkey A chased Monkey X (and X chased A). Donkey B chased Monkey Y (and Y chased B).\nIt's possible A did not chase Y, and B did not chase X. So, no single donkey necessarily chased *every* monkey.\n*This statement is not necessarily true.*\n\n**2. A donkey chased a monkey.**\nFrom rule 4, \"Every donkey chased a monkey that chased it.\" Since there is at least one donkey (given in point 2), let's call it Donkey A. Donkey A must have chased *a* monkey (let's call it Monkey X). So, yes, a donkey chased a monkey.\n*This statement must be true.*\n\n**3. No donkeys chased a monkey.**\nThis is the direct opposite of statement 2. Since statement 2 must be true, this statement must be false.\n*This statement is not necessarily true (in fact, it's necessarily false).*\n\n**4. Every donkey chased every monkey.**\nThis means for every donkey $d \\in D$ and every monkey $m \\in M$, $d$ chased $m$.\nDoes our rule \"Every donkey chased a monkey that chased it\" guarantee this? No.\nAgain, Donkey A chased Monkey X (and X chased A). Donkey B chased Monkey Y (and Y chased B).\nIt's possible A did not chase Y, and B did not chase X. The rule only guarantees that *each* donkey chased *at least one specific* monkey (that chased it back), not *all* monkeys.\n*This statement is not necessarily true.*\n\n**5. There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\nThis means there exists a donkey $d_0$ such that for all monkeys $m \\in M$, $m$ chased $d_0$.\nDoes our rule \"Every donkey chased a monkey that chased it\" guarantee this? No.\nThe rule states that for every donkey $d$, there's *some* monkey $m$ that chased $d$. It doesn't say there's one specific donkey that *all* monkeys chased.\nConsider: Monkey X chased Donkey A. Monkey Y chased Donkey B. It's possible X did not chase B, and Y did not chase A.\n*This statement is not necessarily true.*\n\n**6. No donkeys chased every monkey.**\nThis means it is *not* the case that \"a donkey chased every monkey\" (which is statement 1).\nIf statement 1 is \"A donkey chased every monkey\", then statement 6 is its negation.\nWe determined that statement 1 is \"not necessarily true\". This means it *could* be true in some scenarios (e.g., if there's only one monkey, or if one donkey happens to chase all monkeys), but it's not *guaranteed* by the rules.\nIf statement 1 is not necessarily true, then its negation (statement 6) is also not necessarily true.\nFor example, if there's only one monkey, then \"A donkey chased every monkey\" (statement 1) would be true if any donkey chased that one monkey (which is guaranteed by rule 4). In this case, statement 6 would be false.\nIf there are multiple monkeys and no single donkey chased all of them, then statement 1 is false, and statement 6 is true.\nSince it can be true or false depending on the specific configuration of donkeys and monkeys, it's not *necessarily* true.\n*This statement is not necessarily true.*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 2 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Hazel (Z) is asleep (Asleep(Z)).\n*   **Observation Chain:** A human (H1) saw a monkey (M1) that saw a donkey (D1). This implies H1 exists, M1 exists, D1 exists, and H1 is a human, M1 is a monkey, D1 is a donkey.\n*   **Donkey Running:** Not all donkeys will run (\u00ac\u2200x (IsDonkey(x) \u2192 WillRun(x))). This means there is at least one donkey that will not run (\u2203x (IsDonkey(x) \u2227 \u00acWillRun(x))).\n*   **Lewis's Species:** It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey (\u00acIsDonkey(Lewis)).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nWe need to determine which statement *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 1: Not all donkeys will run but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.**\n\n*   \"Not all donkeys will run\": This is directly stated in the given information. (True)\n*   \"it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep\": This is equivalent to \"Alfred is asleep.\" We are given that Alfred is asleep. (True)\n*   Since both parts are true, the conjunction is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n\n*   We know Alfred is asleep and Hazel is asleep. We have no information whatsoever about whether Alfred or Hazel will run. Their sleep status doesn't imply anything about their running status.\n*   This statement *might* be true, but it doesn't *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Alfred will run.**\n\n*   Similar to Statement 2, we have no information about Alfred's running status.\n*   This statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n\n*   We have no information about Alfred's running status.\n*   We have no information about Lewis's running status. We only know Lewis is not a donkey. Lewis could be a human or a monkey, and we still don't know if they will run.\n*   This statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred won't run.**\n\n*   We have no information about Alfred's running status. He could run, or he could not run.\n*   This statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Not all donkeys will run and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n\n*   \"Not all donkeys will run\": This is directly stated in the given information. (True)\n*   \"Alfred isn't asleep\": This contradicts the given information that Alfred is asleep. (False)\n*   Since one part of the conjunction is false, the entire statement is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

(This information seems irrelevant to the \"seeing\" and \"chasing\" relationships, but we note it.)\n*   **No Monkeys Saw a Monkey:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means for any monkey $m_1$ and any monkey $m_2$, $m_1$ did not see $m_2$. In other words, the set of (monkey, monkey) pairs where the first saw the second is empty.\n*   **Every Human Chased Every Human That Chased It:** If human $h_1$ chased human $h_2$, then $h_2$ chased $h_1$. This describes a symmetric \"chased\" relationship within humans. (Irrelevant to the \"seeing\" statements about monkeys).\n*   **Every Human Saw Every Monkey That Saw Every Donkey:** If $m$ is a monkey and $d$ is a donkey, and $m$ saw $d$, then every human $h$ saw $m$. (Irrelevant to the \"seeing\" statements about monkeys).\n*   **No Donkeys Chased Alfred IFF a Human Saw Hazel:** This is a biconditional statement about chasing and seeing, involving donkeys, humans, Alfred, and Hazel. (Irrelevant to the \"seeing\" statements about monkeys).\n\n**Focusing on the \"No Monkeys Saw a Monkey\" rule:**\n\nThis rule directly addresses the relationships between monkeys seeing other monkeys. It states:\nFor any monkey $X$ and any monkey $Y$, $X$ did not see $Y$.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on this rule:\n\n**1. There is a monkey that every monkey saw.**\nThis statement claims there exists a monkey $M_0$ such that for every monkey $M_i$, $M_i$ saw $M_0$.\nHowever, the rule \"No Monkeys Saw a Monkey\" directly contradicts this. If $M_i$ saw $M_0$, then a monkey saw a monkey, which is forbidden.\nTherefore, statement 1 must be **false**.\n\n**2. A monkey saw every monkey.**\nThis statement claims there exists a monkey $M_0$ such that for every monkey $M_i$, $M_0$ saw $M_i$.\nAgain, if $M_0$ saw $M_i$, then a monkey saw a monkey, which is forbidden by the rule \"No Monkeys Saw a Monkey\".\nTherefore, statement 2 must be **false**.\n\n**3. A monkey saw a monkey.**\nThis statement claims there exists at least one monkey $M_1$ and at least one monkey $M_2$ such that $M_1$ saw $M_2$.\nThis is the direct negation of the rule \"No Monkeys Saw a Monkey\".\nTherefore, statement 3 must be **false**.\n\n**4. Every monkey saw every monkey.**\nThis statement claims that for every monkey $M_1$ and every monkey $M_2$, $M_1$ saw $M_2$.\nThis implies that if there are any monkeys, then at least one monkey saw another monkey (or itself, if we consider self-seeing). This directly contradicts the rule \"No Monkeys Saw a Monkey\".\nTherefore, statement 4 must be **false**.\n\n**5. A monkey saw every monkey that saw it.**\nLet's analyze this carefully. This statement claims:\nThere exists a monkey $M_0$ such that for every monkey $M_i$, if $M_i$ saw $M_0$, then $M_0$ saw $M_i$.\n\nConsider the premise \"if $M_i$ saw $M_0$\". According to the rule \"No Monkeys Saw a Monkey\", it is *never* true that $M_i$ saw $M_0$.\nTherefore, the premise \"if $M_i$ saw $M_0$\" is always false.\nIn logic, an implication \"If P then Q\" is true whenever P is false, regardless of Q's truth value. This is known as vacuous truth.\nSince the premise ($M_i$ saw $M_0$) is always false for any monkeys $M_i, M_0$, the implication \"if $M_i$ saw $M_0$, then $M_0$ saw $M_i$\" is always true for any choice of $M_0$ and $M_i$.\nSince this implication is always true for any $M_0$ and any $M_i$, it is certainly true that there exists *a* monkey ($M_0$) for which this holds for *every* monkey ($M_i$). In fact, it holds for *every* monkey $M_0$.\n\nTherefore, statement 5 must be **true**.\n\n**6. Every monkey saw a monkey.**\nThis statement claims that for every monkey $M_1$, there exists a monkey $M_2$ such that $M_1$ saw $M_2$.\nThis directly implies that at least one monkey saw a monkey, which contradicts the rule \"No Monkeys Saw a Monkey\".\nTherefore, statement 6 must be **false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the crucial rule \"No Monkeys Saw a Monkey\", only statement 5 can be true due to vacuous truth.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

We only know that *if* Alfred ate, then Alfred *must* be a donkey. We don't have information that forces Alfred to be a donkey or to eat.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. A human is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n*   \"A human is happy\" is given as true (H -> Happy).\n*   \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is also given as true.\n*   \"A just in case B\" means (A if and only if B), or (A <-> B).\n*   So, this statement is asking if (True <-> True).\n*   Since both parts are true based on the given information, the biconditional (True <-> True) is true.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**3. Alfred didn't eat.**\n*   Similar to statement 1, we don't know Alfred's category.\n*   If Alfred is a human or a monkey, then Alfred didn't eat (because only donkeys ate).\n*   But if Alfred is a donkey, Alfred *could* have eaten. We don't have information to definitively say Alfred didn't eat.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. Alfred and Hazel ate.**\n*   From \"ONLY donkeys ate,\" if Alfred ate, Alfred is a donkey. If Hazel ate, Hazel is a donkey.\n*   We don't know if Alfred or Hazel are donkeys, or if they ate.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. Alfred and Lewis ate.**\n*   Similar to statement 4. We don't know if Alfred or Lewis are donkeys, or if they ate.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n*   \"A human is happy\" is true.\n*   \"No donkeys chased Alfred\" is *not* the same as \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n    *   \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" means there's at least one donkey that *didn't* chase Alfred, or that the set of donkeys that chased Alfred is not the entire set of donkeys.

(This is a conditional statement, but its antecedent \"every human is asleep\" is not necessarily true, so we can't directly infer anything about Alfred running or monkeys seeing Hazel from this alone).\n\n**Analyzing the Crucial Statement:** \"A human saw every monkey.\"\n\nLet's denote the set of humans as H_set and the set of monkeys as M_set.\nThe statement means: $\\exists h \\in H_{set}$ such that $\\forall m \\in M_{set}$, h saw m.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n**1. A human saw a monkey.**\n*   From \"A human saw every monkey,\" we know there exists at least one human (let's call them H1) who saw *all* monkeys. Since there's at least one monkey, H1 must have seen at least one monkey.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**2.

But we don't know if any monkey saw H1, or if all monkeys saw the *same* human.\n*   Consider a scenario: Human H1 saw Monkey M1 and Monkey M2. M1 saw H1. M2 saw H2 (a different human). In this case, there isn't a single human that *every* monkey saw.\n*   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**3.

(Exists H such that H will A)\n6.  **Sleep & Donkeys:** Only donkeys are asleep. (S -> D)\n    *   This means if something is asleep, it must be a donkey.\n    *   It also implies: If something is not a donkey, it is not asleep.

A donkey kicked a human.**\n\n*   From Rule 1: Every human kicked every donkey.\n*   This means for any human 'h' and any donkey 'd', 'h kicked d' is true.\n*   However, this rule does *not* imply anything about donkeys kicking humans. The action is unidirectional from human to donkey.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that a donkey kicked a human.\n\n**2. No donkeys kicked every human.**\n\n*   Again, Rule 1 states humans kicked donkeys. It says nothing about donkeys kicking humans.\n*   We have no information to confirm or deny that any donkey kicked *every* human, or even *any* human.\n*   This statement cannot be definitively proven true or false.\n\n**3. Every donkey kicked every human.**\n\n*   Similar to the above, this is the inverse of Rule 1. Rule 1 is \"Every human kicked every donkey.\"\n*   We have no information to support donkeys kicking humans, let alone *every* donkey kicking *every* human.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. A donkey kicked every human.**\n\n*   This is a weaker version of statement 3. It claims there exists at least one donkey that kicked every human.\n*   Still, we have no information about donkeys kicking humans.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. Every donkey kicked a human.**\n\n*   This means for every donkey 'd', there exists at least one human 'h' such that 'd kicked h'.\n*   Again, the given rules only describe humans kicking donkeys, not the other way around.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. There is a donkey that every human kicked.**\n\n*   Let's rephrase this: \"There exists a donkey 'd' such that for every human 'h', 'h kicked d'.\"\n*   Look at Rule 1: \"Every human kicked every donkey.\"\n*   This rule states: For every human 'h' AND for every donkey 'd', 'h kicked d' is true.\n*   Since there is at least one donkey (given), let's call it 'd1'.\n*   According to Rule 1, every human kicked 'd1'.\n*   Since there is at least one donkey, this statement must be true. We can pick *any* donkey, and every human must have kicked it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 6 can be logically deduced from the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

It only guarantees that at least one human *didn't* kick Hazel. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n4.  **Hazel kicked a human.** This statement is about Hazel's action, not humans' actions towards Hazel.

This statement introduces new conditions (Alfred seeing Lewis, monkeys seeing Hazel) that are not directly derivable as true or false from the given information. We cannot definitively say this must be true.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.**\n*   \"A just in case B\" means \"A if and only if B\".\n*   So, \"(Alfred doesn't see Hazel) IFF (no monkeys saw Lewis)\".\n*   We know \"No monkeys saw Alfred\" is true. This statement introduces new conditions (Alfred seeing Hazel, monkeys seeing Lewis) that are not directly derivable as true or false from the given information. We cannot definitively say this must be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Every monkey saw Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n*   Let's break this down:\n    *   \"Every monkey saw Alfred\": This contradicts the given information \"No monkeys saw Alfred\". So, this part is **False**.\n    *   \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\": This contradicts the given information \"Lewis sees Hazel\". So, this part is **False**.\n*   Since both parts of the \"and\" statement are false, the entire statement is **False**. Therefore, it cannot be true.\n\n**Statement 4: Every monkey saw Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n*   Let's break this down:\n    *   \"Every monkey saw Alfred\": This contradicts the given information \"No monkeys saw Alfred\". So, this part is **False**.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel\": This means \"Lewis sees Hazel\". This is consistent with the given information \"Lewis sees Hazel\". So, this part is **True**.\n*   Since the first part of the \"but\" (which acts as an \"and\") statement is false, the entire statement is **False**. Therefore, it cannot be true.\n\n**Statement 5: No monkeys saw Alfred just in case Lewis saw Hazel.**\n*   Let's break this down:\n    *   \"No monkeys saw Alfred\": This is directly stated as true in the given information. So, this part is **True**.\n    *   \"Lewis saw Hazel\": This is directly stated as true (from \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel\") in the given information.

We don't have enough information to determine the truth value of either of these disjuncts. For example, if Alfred sees Lewis and all monkeys saw Hazel, then the statement would be false.

So, we cannot deduce anything about **~HCH** from this statement alone.\n\n*   Consider statement 6: \"~AA -> (~DHK -> MLK)\".\n    We know **~MLK** is true.\n    Let's analyze the inner implication: (~DHK -> MLK).\n    Since MLK is false, for (~DHK -> MLK) to be true, ~DHK must be false.\n    Therefore, DHK must be true. (If ~DHK were true, then (True -> False) would be False, making the whole inner implication false).\n    So, from (~DHK -> MLK) being true and MLK being false, we deduce **DHK** (All donkeys kicked Hazel).\n\n    Now, let's look at the outer implication: \"~AA -> (True)\".\n    Since the consequent (~DHK -> MLK) is true (as we just deduced), the entire implication \"~AA -> (~DHK -> MLK)\" is true regardless of the truth value of ~AA.\n    Therefore, we cannot deduce anything about **AA** or **~AA** from this statement alone.\n\n*   We have **~MLK** and **~LH**.\n\n**Evaluate the Options:**\n\n1.  **\"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and a monkey is happy.\"**\n    *   \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is **~MLK**, which we know is true.\n    *   \"a monkey is happy\" - We have no information about whether any monkey is happy. We only know Lewis isn't happy. This statement *might* be true, but it's not *necessarily* true.\n\n2.  **\"Every monkey kicked Lewis and a monkey is happy.\"**\n    *   \"Every monkey kicked Lewis\" is **MLK**, which we know is false (~MLK is true).\n    *   Since the first part is false, the entire conjunction is false. This statement must be false.\n\n3.  **\"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis is happy.\"**\n    *   \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is **~MLK**, which we know is true.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Lewis is happy\" is **~LH**, which we know is true.\n    *   Since both parts are true, the entire conjunction is true. This statement **must be true**.\n\n4.  **\"Alfred will attack.\"**\n    *   This is **AA**. We could not deduce the truth value of AA from the given information. It might be true or false.\n\n5.  **\"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis is happy.\"**\n    *   \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is **~MLK**, which we know is true.\n    *   \"Lewis is happy\" is **LH**, which we know is false (~LH is true).\n    *   Since the second part is false, the entire conjunction is false. This statement must be false.\n\n6.  **\"Alfred and Lewis will attack.\"**\n    *   We don't know if Alfred will attack (AA).\n    *   We don't know if Lewis will attack (no information given).\n    *   This statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the deductions, only statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This immediately eliminates options 1 and 2, as they state \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" or don't include \"Hazel sees Hazel\".\n\nNow let's look at the \"running\" part of the statements.\n\nWe are given:\n*   \"Not all humans will run\" ($\\neg (\\forall h \\in H, R(h))$)\n*   \"Every donkey will run\" ($\\forall d \\in D, R(d)$)\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options based on these facts:\n\n*   **Option 3: Hazel saw Hazel and a human will run.**\n    *   We know \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is true.\n    *   \"a human will run\" means $\\exists h \\in H, R(h)$.\n    *   Is it possible that \"Not all humans will run\" is true, but \"a human will run\" is false?\n        *   If \"a human will run\" is false, then no human will run, i.e., $\\forall h \\in H, \\neg R(h)$.\n        *   If $\\forall h \\in H, \\neg R(h)$ is true, then it is also true that \"Not all humans will run\" (because no humans run, so it's certainly not the case that *all* humans run).\n        *   Therefore, \"a human will run\" ($\\exists h \\in H, R(h)$) is *not* necessarily true. The statement \"Not all humans will run\" only tells us that there's at least one human who *won't* run. It doesn't guarantee that *any* human *will* run. For example, if no humans run, then \"not all humans run\" is true.\n    *   So, \"a human will run\" is not necessarily true. Thus, option 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **Option 4: Hazel saw Hazel and no humans will run.**\n    *   We know \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is true.\n    *   \"no humans will run\" means $\\forall h \\in H, \\neg R(h)$.\n    *   Is this consistent with \"Not all humans will run\"? Yes, if no humans run, then it's certainly true that not all humans run.\n    *   Is this *necessarily* true? No. \"Not all humans will run\" means there's at least one human who won't run. It doesn't mean *no* humans will run. Some humans could run, as long as at least one doesn't.\n    *   So, \"no humans will run\" is not necessarily true. Thus, option 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **Option 5: Hazel saw Hazel and only humans will run.**\n    *   We know \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is true.\n    *   \"only humans will run\" means:\n        *   If X runs, then X is a human.\n        *   This implies that no donkeys will run and no monkeys will run.\n    *   However, we are given \"every donkey will run\". This directly contradicts \"no donkeys will run\".\n    *   Therefore, \"only humans will run\" is false. Thus, option 5 is false.\n\n*   **Option 6: Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run.**\n    *   We know \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is true (from Conclusion 1).\n    *   We are directly given \"Not all humans will run\".\n    *   Both conjuncts are true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet's re-verify everything.\n\n1.  **Hazel sees Hazel:** This is derived directly from \"it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\" This is a definite truth.\n2.  **Not all humans will run:** This is given directly in the problem statement. This is a definite truth.\n\nTherefore, the conjunction \"Hazel saw Hazel and not all humans will run\" must be true.\n\nThe other conditions (about donkeys kicking Hazel, Hazel kicking Hazel, and monkeys seeing/kicking Hazel) are not needed to determine the truth of statement 6. They are consistent with it, but not required for its derivation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There is at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Donkeys & Alfred (Initial):** Every donkey saw Alfred. (This is a crucial starting point).\n4.  **Lewis & Donkeys (Happiness):** Lewis will run (LR) OR no donkeys are happy (NDH). (LR V NDH)\n5.  **Donkeys & Running (Initial):** Not all donkeys will run (\u00ac\u2200DR).\n6.  **Hazel:** It is not the case that Hazel is a monkey (\u00ac(Hazel is M)).\n7.  **Donkeys & Kicking Alfred:** Not all donkeys kicked Alfred (\u00ac\u2200DKA).\n8.  **Lewis & Hazel (Seeing):** It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel (\u00ac(\u00acLSH)) which simplifies to Lewis sees Hazel (LSH).\n\n**Analysis of the Initial Information:**\n\n*   **From (3): \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\"** This means for any donkey 'x', 'x saw Alfred' is true.\n\n*   **From (5): \"Not all donkeys will run.\"** This means there is at least one donkey that will not run.\n\n*   **From (7): \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"** This means there is at least one donkey that did not kick Alfred.\n\n*   **From (6) and (1):** Hazel is not a monkey. Since everything is exclusively a donkey, human, or monkey, Hazel must be either a donkey or a human.\n\n**Revisiting the Statements and Checking for Truth:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the initial premise (3) in light of the later premises. This is a common trick in logical reasoning problems where later information might contradict or modify earlier information.\n\nThe problem states:\n\"Every donkey saw Alfred.\" (Premise A)\nAND\n\"Not all donkeys saw Alfred.\" (Statement 5)\n\nThese two statements are direct contradictions. If \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" is true, then \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" must be false. If \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" is true, then \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" must be false.\n\nThis implies that the initial premise \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" (from the problem description) cannot be taken as an absolute truth if it leads to a contradiction with other *given* information. However, the problem asks what *must be true in this situation*. This means we need to find a consistent interpretation.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully:\n\"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each. Every donkey saw Alfred. Lewis will run or no donkeys are happy. Not all donkeys will run but it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n\nThe phrase \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" is presented as a *given fact* of the situation.\nThen, \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" is presented as one of the *options* to choose from, but it's also implicitly part of the \"Not all donkeys will run but it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" structure.\n\nThis is a poorly phrased problem if \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" is a premise and \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" is also a premise. If both are premises, the situation is contradictory, and nothing *must* be true because the premises themselves are inconsistent.\n\nHowever, let's assume the problem intends for the initial statement \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" to be a *premise* that defines the situation, and the options (1-6) are what we need to evaluate *based on all premises*.\n\nLet's list the premises explicitly:\nP1: Everything is D, H, or M (exclusive).\nP2: At least one of each (D, H, M).\nP3: Every donkey saw Alfred. (\u2200x (Dx \u2192 xSA))\nP4: Lewis will run (LR) V No donkeys are happy (NDH).\nP5: Not all donkeys will run (\u00ac\u2200x (Dx \u2192 xWR)).\nP6: Hazel is not a monkey (\u00acHM).\nP7: Not all donkeys kicked Alfred (\u00ac\u2200x (Dx \u2192 xKA)).\nP8: Lewis sees Hazel (LSH).\n\nNow, let's look at P3 and P5.\nP3: Every donkey saw Alfred.\nP5: Not all donkeys will run. (This is a premise, not an option to choose from).\n\nWait, I misread the problem. \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" is *not* a premise. It is *option 5* in the list of statements to evaluate.\n\nLet's re-list the premises correctly:\n\n**Premises (Given Facts of the Situation):**\n\n1.  Everything is a donkey (D), or a human (H), or a monkey (M) (exclusively).\n2.  There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Every donkey saw Alfred.** (\u2200x (Dx \u2192 x saw Alfred))\n4.  Lewis will run (LR) OR no donkeys are happy (NDH). (LR V NDH)\n5.  **Not all donkeys will run.** (\u00ac\u2200x (Dx \u2192 x will run))\n6.  It is not the case that Hazel is a monkey. (\u00ac(Hazel is M))\n7.  **Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.** (\u00ac\u2200x (Dx \u2192 x kicked Alfred))\n8.  It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel. (Lewis sees Hazel)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on these premises:\n\n**1. Alfred saw a donkey.**\n*   From Premise 3: \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\"\n*   This means for any donkey 'd', 'd saw Alfred' is true.\n*   If 'd saw Alfred', then Alfred must have seen 'd'.\n*   Since there is at least one donkey (Premise 2), let's call it Donkey1. Donkey1 saw Alfred. Therefore, Alfred saw Donkey1.\n*   Thus, Alfred saw a donkey.\n*   **This statement must be true.**\n\n**2. Alfred saw every donkey.**\n*   From Premise 3: \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\"\n*   This means for any donkey 'd', 'd saw Alfred' is true.\n*   If 'd saw Alfred', then Alfred must have seen 'd'.\n*   Since this applies to *every* donkey, it follows that Alfred saw every donkey.\n*   **This statement must be true.**\n\n**3. A donkey saw Alfred.**\n*   From Premise 3: \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\"\n*   Since there is at least one donkey (Premise 2), let's call it Donkey1.\n*   According to Premise 3, Donkey1 saw Alfred.\n*   Thus, a donkey saw Alfred.\n*   **This statement must be true.**\n\n**4. Alfred will run.**\n*   We have information about donkeys running (Premise 5: \"Not all donkeys will run\").\n*   We have information about Lewis running (Premise 4: \"Lewis will run or no donkeys are happy\").\n*   We have no information linking Alfred to running. Alfred could be a human, a donkey, or a monkey. Even if Alfred were a donkey, Premise 5 only says *not all* donkeys will run, not that *no* donkeys will run.\n*   There is no premise that forces Alfred to run.\n*   **This statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**5. Not all donkeys saw Alfred.**\n*   From Premise 3: \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\"\n*   This statement (\"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\") is the direct negation of Premise 3.\n*   If Premise 3 is true, then this statement must be false.\n*   **This statement must be false.**\n\n**6. No donkeys saw Alfred.**\n*   From Premise 3: \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\"\n*   This statement (\"No donkeys saw Alfred\") is the direct negation of \"A donkey saw Alfred\", which we established as true (and is a direct consequence of Premise 3 and Premise 2).\n*   If \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" is true, then \"No donkeys saw Alfred\" must be false.\n*   **This statement must be false.**\n\n**Summary of Must-Be-True Statements:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1. Alfred saw a donkey. (TRUE)\n2. Alfred saw every donkey. (TRUE)\n3. A donkey saw Alfred. (TRUE)\n\nThe other premises (4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are consistent with these conclusions but do not add or subtract from the truth value of statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, which are directly related to \"donkeys seeing Alfred.\"\n\nThe crucial part is that \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" is a *given premise*.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Alfred saw a donkey.\n2. Alfred saw every donkey.\n3. A donkey saw Alfred.",

(\u2200h \u2208 H, \u2200d \u2208 D, h saw d)\n*   **Rule 2:** A human chased Hazel only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis. (This rule seems to be a distractor for the \"seeing\" relationships between species. It involves specific individuals and actions not directly related to the general \"seeing\" rules.)\n*   **Rule 3:** A human will attack and Hazel didn't chase Hazel. (Another distractor, similar to Rule 2.)\n\nThe core of the problem revolves around the \"seeing\" relationship between humans and donkeys, specifically Rule 1: \"Every human saw every donkey.\"\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n**1. A donkey saw a human.**\n*   From Rule 1, we know that every human saw every donkey.\n*   Since there is at least one human (H) and at least one donkey (D), let's pick any human `h1` and any donkey `d1`.\n*   According to Rule 1, `h1` saw `d1`.\n*   However, the statement asks if a donkey saw a human. Rule 1 only tells us about humans seeing donkeys, not the other way around.\n*   It is possible that donkeys are blind, or simply didn't see any humans.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**2. Every donkey saw every human.**\n*   This is the inverse of Rule 1. Rule 1 states \"Every human saw every donkey.\"\n*   Rule 1 does *not* imply that every donkey saw every human.\n*   For example, if I say \"Every student read every book,\" it doesn't mean \"Every book was read by every student\" (some books might not have been read by all students, or some students might not have read all books).\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**3. Every donkey saw a human.**\n*   This statement says that for every donkey, there exists at least one human that it saw.\n*   Again, Rule 1 only tells us about humans seeing donkeys. It provides no information about donkeys seeing humans.\n*   It's possible that donkeys are blind, or simply didn't see any humans.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**4. A donkey saw every human.**\n*   This statement says there exists at least one donkey that saw every human.\n*   Similar to the previous points, Rule 1 gives no information about donkeys seeing humans.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**5. No donkeys saw every human.**\n*   This statement is the negation of statement 4.\n*   Since we have no information about donkeys seeing humans, we cannot conclude that *no* donkeys saw every human. It's possible that one did, or none did. We simply don't know.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**6. A human saw every donkey.**\n*   Let's re-examine Rule 1: \"Every human saw every donkey.\"\n*   This means: For *any* human you pick, that human saw *every single* donkey.\n*   Since there is at least one human (let's call them `h_x`), and Rule 1 applies to `h_x`, it means `h_x` saw every donkey.\n*   Therefore, there exists at least one human (namely, any human) who saw every donkey.\n*   This statement *must* be true.\n\nThe information about Lewis, Hazel, chasing, and attacking is irrelevant to the \"seeing\" relationships between the species.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

If Alfred were a donkey or a monkey, his happiness wouldn't be directly tied to the \"every human is happy\" rule in a way that helps us categorize him. The most direct and logical inference is that Alfred is a human.\n    *   *Assumption:* Alfred is a human.\n\n2.  **Hazel's Category:**\n    *   Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n    *   This is a self-referential statement. It's a bit of a trick. If Hazel *could* see herself, then the statement \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" would be false. If Hazel *cannot* see herself (e.g., she's blind, or she's a concept, or she's a donkey that doesn't \"see\" in the human sense), then the statement \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" would be true.\n    *   However, the problem states \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey.\" This implies physical beings that can \"see.\"\n    *   The most common interpretation of \"X doesn't see X\" in these types of logic puzzles is that X is not a human or a monkey (who typically \"see\" things, including potentially themselves in a mirror or reflection). Donkeys, while they have eyes, are often used in puzzles to represent entities that don't have the same self-awareness or visual interaction as humans or monkeys.\n    *   Let's consider the implications:\n        *   If Hazel is a human, she *could* see herself (e.g., in a mirror). So \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" would imply she's blind or in a dark room, which isn't given.\n        *   If Hazel is a monkey, similar logic applies.\n        *   If Hazel is a donkey, it's plausible that a donkey \"doesn't see itself\" in the same self-aware way a human or monkey might, or it's simply a characteristic attributed to donkeys in this specific world.\n    *   Given the other rules, especially \"No donkeys saw Lewis,\" it's common for donkeys to have specific, often negative, attributes.\n    *   *Assumption:* Hazel is a donkey. This makes \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" a true statement without needing further conditions (like blindness).\n\n3.  **Lewis's Category:**\n    *   \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"\n    *   We've assumed Hazel is a donkey. So, Hazel didn't see Lewis. This is consistent.\n    *   This statement tells us something about Lewis's interaction with donkeys, but not directly about Lewis's category. Lewis could be a human, a monkey, or even a donkey (though a donkey not seeing itself is less relevant here).\n\n4.  **Drinking and Chasing Logic:**\n    *   \"Every human drank (H_drank) IFF every monkey chased Hazel (M_chased_Hazel).\"\n    *   We know Alfred is a human.\n    *   Since Alfred is a human, if \"Every human drank\" is true, then Alfred drank.\n    *   If \"Every human drank\" is false, then Alfred might or might not have drunk (if he's the *only* human who didn't drink, for example). However, the statement is about *every* human.\n\n**Re-evaluating Alfred's Happiness and Category:**\n\n*   Alfred is happy.\n*   Every human is happy.\n*   This means Alfred *could* be a human.\n*   Could Alfred be a donkey? If so, his happiness is an individual trait, not tied to the \"every human is happy\" rule.\n*   Could Alfred be a monkey? If so, his happiness is an individual trait.\n*   The most direct and strong inference from \"Alfred is happy\" and \"Every human is happy\" is that Alfred *is* a human. If he were not, his happiness would be an irrelevant piece of information in relation to the human rule. This is a common pattern in these types of puzzles: if a specific individual possesses a characteristic that is also a universal characteristic of a group, the individual is usually a member of that group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Alfred is a human.\n\n**Re-evaluating Hazel's \"Seeing\" and Category:**\n\n*   Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n*   If Hazel is a human or a monkey, it's generally assumed they *can* see themselves (e.g., in a reflection). For \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" to be true, it would imply a special condition (blindness, no mirrors, etc.) which isn't given.\n*   If Hazel is a donkey, it's plausible that a donkey doesn't \"see itself\" in the self-aware way implied for humans/monkeys, or it's simply a characteristic of donkeys in this world. This makes the statement true without extra conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Hazel is a donkey.\n\n**Applying the Conclusions:**\n\n*   **Alfred is a human.**\n*   **Hazel is a donkey.**\n\nNow let's use the conditional statement:\n\"Every human drank (H_drank) IFF every monkey chased Hazel (M_chased_Hazel).\"\n\nSince Alfred is a human, if \"Every human drank\" is true, then Alfred drank.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\n1.  **Alfred didn't drink.**\n    *   If Alfred is a human, and \"Every human drank\" is true, then Alfred drank.\n    *   If \"Every human drank\" is false, then it's possible Alfred didn't drink.\n    *   We don't have enough information to definitively say \"Alfred didn't drink.\"\n\n2.  **Alfred is happy and no donkeys saw Lewis.**\n    *   \"Alfred is happy\" is given. So this part is true.\n    *   \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is given. So this part is true.\n    *   Therefore, this entire statement is true.\n\n3.  **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n    *   We know Alfred is a human. If \"Every human drank\" is true, then Alfred drank.\n    *   We don't know Lewis's category or if Lewis drank.\n    *   We cannot confirm this.\n\n4.  **Alfred drank.**\n    *   This depends on whether \"Every human drank\" is true.\n    *   \"Every human drank\" is true IFF \"Every monkey chased Hazel\" is true.\n    *   We don't know if \"Every monkey chased Hazel\" is true or false.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot definitively say \"Alfred drank.\"\n\n5.  **Lewis drank.**\n    *   We don't know Lewis's category or if Lewis drank.\n    *   We cannot confirm this.\n\n6.  **Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n    *   We know Alfred is a human. If \"Every human drank\" is true, then Alfred drank.\n    *   We know Hazel is a donkey. We have no information about donkeys drinking.\n    *   We cannot confirm this.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe only statement that is directly and entirely supported by the given information and the logical deductions is statement 2.\n\n*   \"Alfred is happy\" is explicitly stated.\n*   \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is explicitly stated.\n\nTherefore, the conjunction of these two given facts must be true.\n\nThe other statements require additional information (like whether \"every monkey chased Hazel\" is true, or Lewis's drinking status) that is not provided.\n\nThe crucial deductions are:\n*   Alfred is a human (because he's happy and all humans are happy).\n*   Hazel is a donkey (because she doesn't see herself, which is a common way to distinguish non-self-aware animals in these puzzles).\n\nHowever, these deductions are not strictly necessary to confirm statement 2, as statement 2 is a direct restatement of two given facts. The problem asks what *must* be true.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"Which, if any, of the following statements must be true in this situation?\"\n\nThe situation *includes* all the given facts.\n*   Fact 1: Alfred is happy.\n*   Fact 2: Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n*   Fact 3: No donkeys saw Lewis.\n*   Fact 4: Every human is happy.\n*   Fact 5: Every human drank just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nStatement 2 is \"Alfred is happy and no donkeys saw Lewis.\"\nThis is a conjunction of Fact 1 and Fact 3. Since Fact 1 is true and Fact 3 is true, their conjunction must also be true.\n\nNo other statement can be definitively proven true. For example, we don't know if \"every monkey chased Hazel\" is true or false, so we can't determine if \"every human drank\" is true or false, and thus can't determine if Alfred drank.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

None of the other facts provide information about donkeys chasing monkeys.\n\nLet's consider the relationship between the given statements and Fact 1.\n\n*   Statement 4: **\"A monkey chased every donkey.\"**\n    This is exactly what Fact 1 states: $\\exists m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, \\text{Chased}(m, d)$.\n    No, Fact 1 states *every* monkey chased *every* donkey. This is a stronger statement.\n    Fact 1: $\\forall m \\in M, (\\forall d \\in D, \\text{Chased}(m, d))$.\n    Statement 4: $\\exists m \\in M, (\\forall d \\in D, \\text{Chased}(m, d))$.\n\n    If *every* monkey chased *every* donkey, then it must be true that *at least one* monkey chased *every* donkey (since there's at least one monkey).\n    So, Fact 1 implies Statement 4.\n\nLet's verify this implication:\nIf $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, \\text{Chased}(m, d)$ is true, and we know $M$ is not empty (there's at least one monkey), let $m_0$ be any monkey in $M$.\nThen, for this $m_0$, it is true that $\\forall d \\in D, \\text{Chased}(m_0, d)$.\nThis means there exists a monkey ($m_0$) that chased every donkey.\nTherefore, Statement 4 **must be true**.\n\nNow let's consider the other statements. The problem asks which statements *must* be true.\n\nStatements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are about donkeys chasing monkeys. The only information we have about chasing is \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\" This does not imply anything about donkeys chasing monkeys. We are not given that chasing is a symmetric relationship.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario:\nDonkeys = {D1}\nMonkeys = {M1}\nHumans = {H1}\n\nFact 1: M1 chased D1. (This is true)\n\nNow let's check the statements about donkeys chasing monkeys:\n1.  A donkey chased a monkey. (Is D1 chased M1? We don't know.)\n2.  A donkey chased every monkey. (Is D1 chased M1? We don't know.)\n3.  Every donkey chased a monkey. (Is D1 chased M1? We don't know.)\n5.  Every donkey chased every monkey. (Is D1 chased M1? We don't know.)\n6.  No donkeys chased every monkey. (This would be true if D1 did not chase M1. But it could also be false if D1 did chase M1.)\n\nSince we have no information about donkeys chasing monkeys, we cannot conclude that any of statements 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6 must be true. We can construct counter-examples where these statements are false while all the given facts hold.\n\nFor instance, let's assume:\n*   Donkeys = {d1}\n*   Monkeys = {m1}\n*   Humans = {Lewis, Alfred, Hazel}\n*   Chasing: Only m1 chased d1. (No donkey chased any monkey).\n*   Seeing: m1 saw Lewis. Lewis saw m1. (This satisfies \"A monkey saw a human that saw a monkey.\")\n*   Kicking: No monkey kicked Lewis. All monkeys (m1) did not see Hazel. (This satisfies \"A monkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" because \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is true, so the \"unless\" clause is met, and the main statement is true regardless of kicking Lewis).\n*   Kicking: All humans kicked Alfred. No monkeys saw Lewis. (This satisfies \"Not all humans kicked Alfred just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.\" because \"Not all humans kicked Alfred\" is false, and \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" is false, so False iff False is True).\n\nIn this scenario:\n*   Fact 1 (\"Every monkey chased every donkey\") is true (m1 chased d1).\n*   Fact 2 (\"A monkey saw a human that saw a monkey\") is true (m1 saw Lewis, Lewis saw m1).\n*   Fact 3 (\"A monkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel\") is true (not all monkeys saw Hazel, so the condition is met).\n*   Fact 4 (\"Not all humans kicked Alfred just in case no monkeys saw Lewis\") is true (False iff False).\n\nNow let's check the statements:\n1.  A donkey chased a monkey. (False, d1 did not chase m1)\n2.  A donkey chased every monkey. (False, d1 did not chase m1)\n3.  Every donkey chased a monkey. (False, d1 did not chase m1)\n4.  A monkey chased every donkey. (True, m1 chased d1)\n5.  Every donkey chased every monkey. (False, d1 did not chase m1)\n6.  No donkeys chased every monkey. (True, because d1 did not chase m1)\n\nWait, if 1, 2, 3, 5 are false, then 6 could be true. My example makes 6 true.\nThe question is which *must* be true. If I can construct a scenario where 6 is true, it doesn't mean it *must* be true. I need to find a scenario where 6 is false, but all conditions hold, to show it's not necessarily true.\n\nLet's try to make 6 false. To make \"No donkeys chased every monkey\" false, we need \"A donkey chased every monkey\" to be true. This is statement 2.\nSo, if statement 2 is true, then statement 6 is false.\nCan we construct a scenario where statement 2 is true, and all given facts are true?\nAssume:\n*   Donkeys = {d1}\n*   Monkeys = {m1}\n*   Humans = {Lewis, Alfred, Hazel}\n*   Chasing: m1 chased d1 AND d1 chased m1. (This makes Fact 1 true, and Statement 2 true).\n*   Seeing: m1 saw Lewis. Lewis saw m1.\n*   Kicking: No monkey kicked Lewis. All monkeys (m1) did not see Hazel.\n*   Kicking: All humans kicked Alfred. No monkeys saw Lewis.\n\nIn this scenario:\n*   Fact 1 (\"Every monkey chased every donkey\") is true (m1 chased d1).\n*   Fact 2 (\"A monkey saw a human that saw a monkey\") is true (m1 saw Lewis, Lewis saw m1).\n*   Fact 3 (\"A monkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel\") is true (not all monkeys saw Hazel, so the condition is met).\n*   Fact 4 (\"Not all humans kicked Alfred just in case no monkeys saw Lewis\") is true (False iff False).\n\nAnd in this scenario:\n*   Statement 2 (\"A donkey chased every monkey\") is true (d1 chased m1).\n*   ",

Every monkey ate but it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred.**\n    *   \"Every monkey ate\" is true (from P4).\n    *   \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred\" means \"Hazel did not see Alfred\". This contradicts P6 (\"Hazel saw Alfred\").\n    *   Since one part is true and the other is false, the entire conjunction is **False**.\n\n**2. Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   \"Not all monkeys ate\" means \"It is not the case that every monkey ate\". This contradicts P4 (\"Every monkey ate\"). So, \"Not all monkeys ate\" is False.\n    *   \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" means \"Alfred did not see Hazel\". We know \"Hazel saw Alfred\" (P6), but this doesn't directly tell us if Alfred saw Hazel. However, in typical logical reasoning, \"A saw B\" doesn't necessarily imply \"B saw A\". Let's assume for a moment that \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" could be true or false independently of P6.\n    *   The statement is of the form \"A just in case B\" (A IFF B). This means (A AND B) OR (NOT A AND NOT B).\n    *   Since \"Not all monkeys ate\" is False, for the IFF statement to be true, \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" must also be False.\n    *   If \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" is False, then \"Alfred sees Hazel\" is True.\n    *   So, this statement implies (False IFF False) or (False IFF True).\n    *   If \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" is False, then the statement is (False IFF False), which is True.\n    *   If \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" is True, then the statement is (False IFF True), which is False.\n    *   Since we cannot definitively determine the truth value of \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" from the given information, we cannot definitively say this statement must be true.\n    *   *Self-correction:* The question asks what *must* be true. Since \"Not all monkeys ate\" is definitively false, for the \"just in case\" (biconditional) statement to be true, \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" *must also be false*. This means \"Alfred sees Hazel\" *must be true*. However, the given information only states \"Hazel saw Alfred\" (P6). It does *not* state that Alfred saw Hazel. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Alfred sees Hazel\" must be true, nor that \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" must be false. Thus, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**3. If a monkey saw Alfred, then Hazel ate.**\n    *   We have no information about whether a monkey saw Alfred.\n    *   We have no information about whether Hazel ate.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n**4. A monkey saw Alfred only if Hazel ate.**\n    *   This is equivalent to \"If a monkey saw Alfred, then Hazel ate.\" (P implies Q is equivalent to P only if Q).\n    *   As with statement 3, we have no information about whether a monkey saw Alfred or whether Hazel ate.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n**5. Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred.**\n    *   \"Every monkey ate\" is true (from P4).\n    *   \"Hazel saw Alfred\" is true (from P6).\n    *   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire conjunction is **True**.\n\n**6. Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a monkey ate.**\n    *   \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" - As discussed in statement 2, we don't know the truth value of this.\n    *   \"a monkey ate\" - This is true because P4 states \"Every monkey ate\", which implies \"at least one monkey ate\".\n    *   So the statement is (Unknown IFF True).\n    *   For this to be true, \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" must be true.\n    *   However, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" must be true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct application of the given premises:\n\n*   P4: Every monkey ate.\n*   P6: Hazel saw Alfred.\n\nStatement 5 directly combines these two established facts.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Donkey-Monkey Chase:** Every donkey (d) chased a monkey (m) that chased it (d). This implies a reciprocal chase relationship between donkeys and monkeys.\n4.  **Hazel's Sight:** Hazel (X) doesn't see Hazel (X). So, X does not see X.\n5.  **Lewis's Sight:** It is not the case that Lewis (L) doesn't see Hazel (X). This means Lewis sees Hazel (L sees X).\n6.  **Lewis's Observer:** A human (h) saw Lewis (L).\n7.  **Eating:** Only donkeys ate.\n\n**Analysis of Key Individuals:**\n\n*   **Hazel (X):**\n    *   From (4), Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n    *   From (5), Lewis sees Hazel.\n    *   Could Hazel be a human? If Hazel is a human, then \"A human saw Lewis\" (from 6) is a separate statement.\n    *   Could Hazel be a donkey? If Hazel is a donkey, then \"Every donkey chased a monkey that chased it\" applies to Hazel.\n    *   Could Hazel be a monkey? If Hazel is a monkey, then \"Every donkey chased a monkey that chased it\" applies to Hazel.\n\n*   **Lewis (L):**\n    *   From (5), Lewis sees Hazel.\n    *   From (6), a human saw Lewis. This means Lewis is *not* a human (because a human saw him, implying he's distinct from the human observer, and if he were a human, the statement would be \"a human saw a human\", which is possible, but the phrasing \"a human saw Lewis\" suggests Lewis is the object of observation). More importantly, if Lewis were a human, then \"a human saw Lewis\" would be true.\n    *   Let's consider Lewis's type:\n        *   If Lewis is a donkey: A human saw a donkey. Lewis sees Hazel.\n        *   If Lewis is a human: A human saw a human. Lewis sees Hazel.\n        *   If Lewis is a monkey: A human saw a monkey. Lewis sees Hazel.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate Hazel's type based on the information:**\n\n*   **Hazel doesn't see Hazel.** This is a self-referential statement about Hazel's perception.\n*   **Lewis sees Hazel.** This is a statement about Lewis's perception of Hazel.\n\n**Crucial Deduction from (4) and (5):**\n\n*   (4) Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n*   (5) Lewis sees Hazel.\n\nThese two statements are about who sees Hazel.\n\n**Let's analyze the options:**\n\n**1. A human saw Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   From (6), \"A human saw Lewis\" is true.\n    *   From (5), \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" is false (because Lewis *does* see Hazel).\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 is **false**.\n\n**2. A human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"A human saw Hazel\" (let's call this P)\n    *   \"Lewis saw Hazel\" (let's call this Q)\n    *   We know from (5) that Q (Lewis saw Hazel) is **true**.\n    *   So, the statement becomes \"P just in case True\", which simplifies to \"P\".\n    *   Therefore, this statement is equivalent to \"A human saw Hazel\".\n    *   Do we know if a human saw Hazel? Not necessarily. We know a human saw Lewis. We don't know if that human (or any human) saw Hazel.\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**3. Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"Lewis saw Lewis\" (let's call this P)\n    *   \"Not all humans saw Hazel\" (let's call this Q)\n    *   We need to determine if P is true and if Q is true.\n    *   **Lewis saw Lewis (P):** We don't have direct information about Lewis seeing himself.\n    *   **Not all humans saw Hazel (Q):** We don't know if *any* human saw Hazel, let alone *all* of them.\n    *   Therefore, statement 3 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**4. Lewis saw Lewis just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"Lewis saw Lewis\" (P)\n    *   \"A human saw Hazel\" (Q)\n    *   Similar to 3, we don't know P or Q.\n    *   Therefore, statement 4 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**5. A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"A human saw Lewis\" (P)\n    *   \"Hazel saw Hazel\" (Q)\n    *   From (6), P is **true**.\n    *   From (4), Q is **false** (Hazel doesn't see Hazel).\n    *   Therefore, \"True and False\" is **false**.\n    *   Statement 5 is **false**.\n\n**6. A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"A human saw Lewis\" (P)\n    *   \"It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" (Q)\n    *   From (6), P is **true**.\n    *   From (4), \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" is true. So, \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is false. Therefore, \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" is **true**.\n    *   Therefore, \"True but True\" (which means \"True and True\") is **true**.\n    *   Statement 6 is **true**.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully to ensure no misinterpretations.\n\n*   \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\" - Confirms the three categories and their existence.\n*   \"Every donkey chased a monkey that chased it.\" - Specific interaction rule.\n*   \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n    *   Hazel doesn't see Hazel (H_sees_H = False)\n    *   NOT (Lewis doesn't see Hazel) => Lewis sees Hazel (L_sees_H = True)\n*   \"A human saw Lewis and only donkeys ate.\"\n    *   (Exists h in Humans) (h saw Lewis)\n    *   (X ate) => (X is a Donkey)\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the options with these clear logical statements:\n\n1.  **A human saw Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   (A human saw Lewis) is True (given).\n    *   (Lewis doesn't see Hazel) is False (because Lewis *does* see Hazel, given).\n    *   True AND False = False.\n\n2.  **A human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel.**\n    *   (Lewis saw Hazel) is True (given).\n    *   So, the statement is equivalent to \"(A human saw Hazel) just in case True\", which simplifies to \"(A human saw Hazel)\".\n    *   We are given \"A human saw Lewis\". We are *not* given \"A human saw Hazel\". It's possible, but not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.**\n    *   We don't know if Lewis saw Lewis.\n    *   We don't know if all humans saw Hazel (or if any did).\n    *   Not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **Lewis saw Lewis just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n    *   We don't know if Lewis saw Lewis.\n    *   We don't know if a human saw Hazel.\n    *   Not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   (A human saw Lewis) is True (given).\n    *   (Hazel saw Hazel) is False (given: \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\").\n    *   True AND False = False.\n\n6.  **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"but\" implies \"and\".\n    *   (A human saw Lewis) is True (given).\n    *   (it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel) is True (because \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" is given, meaning \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is false, so its negation is true).\n    *   True AND True = True.\n\nThe reasoning holds.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

This means \"all humans saw Hazel\" must be true.\n    *   So, if Alfred is human, then all humans saw Hazel.\n\n6.  **Can Alfred be a monkey?**\n    *   If Alfred were a monkey, then \"every monkey saw Alfred\" would imply Alfred saw himself. This is not contradictory.\n    *   However, we have no information to confirm or deny Alfred being a monkey.\n\n7.  **Can Alfred be a donkey?**\n    *   We have no information to confirm or deny Alfred being a donkey.\n\n8.  **Let's re-evaluate the \"human asleep\" condition based on Alfred not being asleep.**\n    *   We know Alfred isn't asleep.\n    *   If Alfred is a human, then it's not true that \"every human is asleep.\"\n    *   From \"Every human is asleep if and only if not all humans saw Hazel,\" if \"every human is asleep\" is false, then \"not all humans saw Hazel\" must also be false.\n    *   If \"not all humans saw Hazel\" is false, then \"all humans saw Hazel\" must be true.\n    *   So, if Alfred is a human, then all humans saw Hazel.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n*   **1. Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   \"Alfred isn't asleep\" is directly given.\n    *   \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" is directly given.\n    *   Both parts are true. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n*   **2. Alfred is asleep.**\n    *   This contradicts the given information that \"Alfred isn't asleep.\" So, this is false.\n\n*   **3. Alfred isn't asleep but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   \"Alfred isn't asleep\" is true.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" means \"Lewis sees Hazel.\"\n    *   However, we are given that \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\" So, \"Lewis sees Hazel\" is false.\n    *   Since the second part is false, the entire \"but\" statement is false.\n\n*   **4. Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n    *   We know \"Alfred isn't asleep.\" So, this statement is false.\n\n*   **5. Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n    *   We know \"Alfred isn't asleep.\" So, this statement is false.\n\n*   **6. Lewis is asleep.**\n    *   We have no information about Lewis's sleep status. We only know Lewis doesn't see Hazel. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information provided, only statement 1 can be definitively concluded as true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

We don't know if the antecedent (\"not all donkeys saw Hazel\") is true, so we can't necessarily deduce anything from the consequent.

We have no information about the sleep status of any human other than Alfred.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **Every human is asleep if and only if a human is asleep.**\n    *   Let P be \"Every human is asleep.\"\n    *   Let Q be \"A human is asleep.\"\n    *   The statement is \"P if and only if Q\" (P <=> Q).\n    *   If P is true (Every human is asleep), then Q must be true (A human is asleep). This part (P => Q) is always logically true.\n    *   If Q is true (A human is asleep), does it mean P is true (Every human is asleep)? Not necessarily. If there are multiple humans and only one is asleep, Q is true but P is false.\n    *   Therefore, the \"if and only if\" part makes this statement not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **A human is asleep.**\n    *   We know Alfred is a human and Alfred is *not* asleep.\n    *   We have no information about any other human being asleep.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **Only humans are asleep.**\n    *   This statement implies two things:\n        *   If something is asleep, it must be a human.\n        *   There is at least one human asleep.\n    *   We don't know if anything is asleep at all. We only know Alfred and Hazel are not.\n    *   Even if something *were* asleep, we have no information to restrict it to *only* humans. A donkey or a monkey could be asleep.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **Not all humans are asleep.**\n    *   We are given that Alfred is a human.\n    *   We are given that Alfred isn't asleep.\n    *   If Alfred is a human and not asleep, then it is impossible for *all* humans to be asleep.\n    *   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\n6.  **Every human is asleep.**\n    *   We know Alfred is a human and Alfred isn't asleep.\n    *   This directly contradicts the statement \"Every human is asleep.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement is necessarily false.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

If Lewis were a donkey, then \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" would imply Lewis didn't see himself, which is possible but doesn't rule out Lewis being a donkey based *solely* on that. However, the problem states \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively)\". If Lewis is a donkey, then Lewis is a donkey. If \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true, and Lewis is a donkey, then Lewis didn't see himself. This is consistent.\n    *   Let's re-examine the implications. If Lewis *were* a donkey, then \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" would mean that no donkey (including Lewis himself, if he is a donkey) saw Lewis. This is logically consistent.\n    *   However, consider the structure: \"No donkeys saw Lewis *and* Lewis isn't a donkey.\"\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true.\n    *   Is \"Lewis isn't a donkey\" necessarily true?\n        *   Lewis is happy.

Lewis *could* be a donkey. The information \"Lewis is happy\" and \"A human is happy\" doesn't *force* Lewis to be a human; it just makes it a possibility.\n    *   Since the second part (\"Lewis isn't a donkey\") is not necessarily true, the entire conjunction is **not necessarily true**.\n\n3.  **Lewis saw a donkey.**\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" This tells us about donkeys seeing Lewis, not about Lewis seeing donkeys.\n    *   Lewis is an entity (human, donkey, or monkey).

(This means there's at least one human who is not hungry, or some humans are hungry and some are not, or no humans are hungry. It *doesn't* mean no humans are hungry.)\n4.  **Donkeys & Hazel:** No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n5.  **Hazel's Attack Condition:** Hazel will attack ONLY IF a donkey kicked Hazel. (This is a biconditional in disguise for the \"attack\" part. If Hazel attacks, then a donkey must have kicked her. If a donkey *didn't* kick her, then Hazel *won't* attack.)\n6.  **Hazel's Hunger & Donkeys/Monkeys:** If Hazel is hungry (HH), then (not all donkeys kicked Alfred (NDA) ONLY IF no monkeys kicked Hazel (NMH)). This can be written as: HH -> (NDA <-> NMH).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet's focus on Hazel's attack first, as it's directly related to a clear piece of information.\n\nFrom point 4: \"No donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\nFrom point 5: \"Hazel will attack ONLY IF a donkey kicked Hazel.\"\n\nLet P = \"A donkey kicked Hazel.\"\nLet Q = \"Hazel will attack.\"\n\nPoint 4 states: Not P (\u00acP).\nPoint 5 states: Q -> P. (If Hazel attacks, then a donkey kicked her).\n\nSince we know \u00acP (no donkeys kicked Hazel), and Q -> P, then it must be the case that \u00acQ (Hazel will not attack).\nIf Hazel were to attack (Q), then P would have to be true (a donkey kicked her). But we know P is false (no donkeys kicked her). Therefore, Hazel cannot attack.\n\n**Conclusion regarding Hazel's attack:** Hazel won't attack.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1.  **Alfred will attack.** We have no information about Alfred attacking or not attacking. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n2.  **Alfred won't attack.** Similar to statement 1, we have no information about Alfred. This statement cannot be determined as true.\n3.  **Hazel won't attack.** Based on our analysis above, this statement **must be true**.\n4.  **Alfred and Hazel will attack.** Since we've determined Hazel won't attack, this statement **must be false**.\n5.  **Hazel will attack.** Based on our analysis above, this statement **must be false**.\n\nThe information about \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each,\" \"Not all humans are hungry,\" and \"If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is not needed to determine Hazel's attack status. This extra information might be distractors or relevant if we needed to deduce something about Alfred or other conditions, but for Hazel's attack, it's not.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

So, \"If a monkey is not hungry, then Lewis is a donkey.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom statement (4), we know **Lewis is not a donkey**.\n\nNow let's look at statement (5): \"Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey is hungry.\"\nUsing the \"If not B, then A\" interpretation:\n\"If a monkey is not hungry, then Lewis is a donkey.\"\n\nWe know Lewis is *not* a donkey. For the conditional \"If P then Q\" to be true, if Q is false, then P must also be false.\nHere, Q is \"Lewis is a donkey\" (which is false).\nSo, P (\"a monkey is not hungry\") must be false.\nIf \"a monkey is not hungry\" is false, then \"a monkey is hungry\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce: **A monkey is hungry.**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the statements based on our deductions:\n\n*   **Lewis is not a donkey.** (From 4)\n*   **A human will run.** (From 4)\n*   **Every human drank.** (From 3)\n*   **A monkey is hungry.** (Deduced from 4 and 5)\n\nNow let's check each option:\n\n1.  **A human drank.**\n    From statement (3), \"Every human drank.\" If every human drank, then it necessarily follows that *a* human drank (since we know there's at least one human).\n    **This statement must be true.**\n\n2.  **No humans drank.**\n    This directly contradicts statement (3) \"Every human drank.\"\n    **This statement must be false.**\n\n3.  **Only humans drank.**\n    We know \"Every human drank.\" This statement implies that *no one else* drank. We have no information to confirm or deny this. For example, a donkey or a monkey might also have drunk. The problem only states what humans did.\n    **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n4.  **Lewis won't run.**\n    From statement (4), we know \"a human will run.\" This tells us *a human* will run, not necessarily Lewis.\n    We know Lewis is not a donkey. Since everything is a donkey, human, or monkey, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n    If Lewis is a human, then Lewis will run (because \"a human will run\" and Lewis is that human).\n    If Lewis is a monkey, we don't know if Lewis will run.\n    We also don't know if Lewis is a human or a monkey.\n    Therefore, we cannot definitively say Lewis won't run.\n    **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n5.  **Lewis will run.**\n    Similar to the above, we know \"a human will run.\" We don't know if Lewis is that human.

If B chases C, then C must chase B.\n\n**Evaluating Each Statement:**\n\nLet's consider the implications of the monkey chasing rule and the existence of at least one monkey.\n\n**Statement 1: A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.**\n*   This statement is a direct rephrasing of the given rule (Point 4).\n*   The rule states: \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\n*   If \"Every monkey\" did this, then \"A monkey\" (which is one of the \"Every monkeys\") must also have done this.\n*   **Must be true.**\n\n**Statement 2: A monkey chased a monkey.**\n*   We know there is at least one monkey (let's call it M_Hazel).\n*   The rule states: \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\n*   Does this rule *guarantee* that any monkey actually chased another monkey, or that any monkey was chased by another monkey?\n*   Consider a scenario with only one monkey (M_Hazel). Can M_Hazel chase M_Hazel? The rule doesn't explicitly forbid or require self-chasing.\n*   If there are two monkeys, M1 and M2. If M1 chased M2, then M2 must chase M1. If M2 chased M1, then M1 must chase M2. But the rule doesn't *force* any initial chase to occur.\n*   The rule is conditional: *IF* a monkey was chased, *THEN* it chased back. It doesn't say that any monkey *was* chased.\n*   Therefore, it's possible that no monkey chased any other monkey (or itself). The rule would still hold true vacuously if no monkey was ever chased by another monkey.\n*   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**Statement 3: Every monkey chased a monkey.**\n*   Similar to Statement 2, this implies that for every monkey, there exists at least one monkey (possibly itself) that it chased.\n*   Again, the rule is conditional. It doesn't mandate that any chasing *must* occur.\n*   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**Statement 4: No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n*   This is the negation of \"A monkey chased every monkey.\"\n*   If Statement 6 (\"A monkey chased every monkey\") is true, then this is false. If Statement 6 is false, then this could be true.\n*   Let's re-evaluate the rule: \"Every monkey (Mx) chased every monkey (My) that (My) chased it (Mx).\"\n*   This rule does not imply that any monkey chased *every* other monkey (or itself). It only implies reciprocity for *existing* chases.\n*   Consider a scenario with three monkeys M1, M2, M3.\n    *   No chases at all. The rule holds vacuously. In this case, \"No monkeys chased every monkey\" would be true.\n    *   M1 chases M2, M2 chases M1. M3 chases no one, no one chases M3. The rule holds. In this case, \"No monkeys chased every monkey\" would be true (M1 didn't chase M3, M2 didn't chase M3, M3 didn't chase M1 or M2).\n*   This statement is not necessarily true. It's possible that *some* monkey *did* chase every monkey (e.g., if there's only one monkey and it chases itself, or if there are two and they chase each other, and the statement means \"every *other* monkey\"). But the rule doesn't *force* this.\n*   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**Statement 5: Every monkey chased every monkey.**\n*   This means for any two monkeys M1 and M2 (including M1=M2), M1 chased M2.\n*   This is a very strong claim. The given rule only states reciprocity for *existing* chases. It does not force all monkeys to chase all other monkeys.\n*   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**Statement 6: A monkey chased every monkey.**\n*   This means there exists at least one monkey (let's call it M_alpha) such that M_alpha chased every other monkey (and possibly itself).\n*   Similar to Statement 5, the given rule does not mandate such a universal chaser. The rule is conditional.\n*   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**Revisiting Statement 1:**\n\n\"A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\n\nThe original rule is: \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\nLet P(x) be the property \"x chased every monkey that chased x\".\nThe given information states: For all x, if x is a monkey, then P(x).\nStatement 1 says: There exists an x such that x is a monkey AND P(x).\n\nIf \"For all x, if x is a monkey, then P(x)\" is true, and we know \"there's at least one monkey\", then it logically follows that \"there exists an x such that x is a monkey AND P(x)\".\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 must be true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the conditional nature of the monkey chasing rule. It's \"If A chased B, then B chased A.\" It's *not* \"A chased B.\"\n\nOnly statement 1 is a direct logical consequence of the given rule and the existence of monkeys.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means that for any monkey $m_1$, there are *no* monkeys $m_2$ such that $m_2$ kicked $m_1$. The set of \"monkeys that kicked it\" is empty.\n*   A statement of the form \"For all X in an empty set, P(X) is true\" is vacuously true.\n*   So, \"every monkey that kicked it ($m_1$)\" is an empty set. The condition \"A monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it\" becomes \"A monkey kicked everything in an empty set\". This is vacuously true for *any* monkey.\n*   Since there is at least one monkey, we can pick any monkey, and for that monkey, the condition holds vacuously.\n*   Therefore, Statement 4 **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 5: Every monkey kicked a monkey.**\n*   This means: $\\forall m_1 \\in M, \\exists m_2 \\in M, m_1 \\text{ kicked } m_2$.\n*   This directly contradicts NKAM. If every monkey kicked *a* monkey, then there would be at least one instance of a monkey kicking a monkey.\n*   Therefore, Statement 5 **must be false**.\n\n**Statement 6: There is a monkey that every monkey kicked.**\n*   This means: $\\exists m_1 \\in M, \\forall m_2 \\in M, m_2 \\text{ kicked } m_1$.\n*   This also directly contradicts NKAM. If such a monkey $m_1$ existed, and there was at least one other monkey $m_2$, then $m_2$ would have kicked $m_1$, which is forbidden. Even if there's only one monkey, that monkey would have to kick itself, which is also forbidden.\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the rule \"No monkeys kicked a monkey,\" only statement 4 can be true. The information about Hazel, Lewis, Alfred, and the \"Monkey Kicked Lewis or Alfred\" rule is not needed to evaluate these statements, as they all pertain to monkeys kicking *other monkeys* (or themselves), which is explicitly forbidden.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Human Happiness:** Every human is happy.\n4.  **Lewis's Happiness:** Lewis is happy.\n5.  **Alfred's Eating Implication:** If Alfred ate (A), then (every monkey chased Hazel (MCH) only if a human chased Hazel (HCH)). This can be written as: A => (MCH => HCH).\n6.  **Hazel's Action:** Hazel didn't chase Hazel (\u00acHCH_Hazel). (This is a bit of a self-referential statement, but it implies Hazel is not chasing herself).\n7.  **Lewis's Identity:** It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey (\u00ac(Lewis is D)). This means Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n\n**Analysis of Given Information:**\n\n*   From (3) \"Every human is happy\" and (4) \"Lewis is happy\", we can infer that Lewis *could* be a human.\n*   From (7) \"It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey\", we know Lewis is not a donkey. Combined with (1) \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey\", Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n*   From (3) \"Every human is happy\", we know that if Lewis is a human, then Lewis is happy. This is consistent with (4).\n*   The statement \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" (6) is a bit of a red herring for the main logical deductions, as it's a self-referential truth. It simply states a fact about Hazel's actions. It doesn't directly impact the other logical implications unless Hazel's identity (human, monkey, donkey) becomes relevant to the chasing condition.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each numbered statement based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 1: A human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\n*   \"A human is happy\": From (3) \"Every human is happy\", it logically follows that \"A human is happy\" is true.\n*   \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey\": This is equivalent to \"Lewis is a donkey\".\n*   From (7) \"It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey\", we know that \"Lewis is a donkey\" is FALSE.\n*   Therefore, \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey\" is FALSE.\n*   Since the second part of the \"but\" (conjunction) is false, the entire statement 1 is **FALSE**.\n\n**Statement 2: Every human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\n*   \"Every human is happy\": This is directly stated in (3). So, this part is TRUE.\n*   \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey\": As analyzed for Statement 1, this is equivalent to \"Lewis is a donkey\", which is FALSE based on (7).\n*   Since the second part of the \"but\" (conjunction) is false, the entire statement 2 is **FALSE**.\n\n**Statement 3: Alfred ate.**\n\n*   We have the implication: A => (MCH => HCH).\n*   We also know \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" (6). This means HCH is false (assuming \"Hazel\" in \"HCH\" refers to the specific individual Hazel, and \"chased Hazel\" refers to Hazel being chased by someone, not Hazel chasing herself).\n*   Let's re-read (6): \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\". This means the specific individual Hazel did not perform the action of chasing herself. This doesn't directly tell us if \"a human chased Hazel\" (HCH) or \"every monkey chased Hazel\" (MCH) is true or false.\n*   However, the phrasing \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is a bit ambiguous. If it means \"it is not the case that Hazel was chased by Hazel\", it's trivially true and doesn't help. If it means \"Hazel did not perform the action of chasing Hazel (herself)\", it's also trivially true.\n*   Let's assume the \"Hazel\" in \"MCH\" and \"HCH\" refers to the individual Hazel being *chased*. So, MCH means \"every monkey chased [the individual] Hazel\", and HCH means \"a human chased [the individual] Hazel\".\n*   The statement \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" (6) doesn't provide any information about whether *other* entities (humans or monkeys) chased Hazel.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if MCH or HCH are true or false from the given information.\n*   Since we cannot determine the truth value of (MCH => HCH), we cannot determine the truth value of A.\n*   Thus, we cannot conclude that \"Alfred ate\" must be true. Statement 3 is **NOT NECESSARILY TRUE**.\n\n**Statement 4: Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n\n*   Let P be \"Every human is asleep\".\n*   Let Q be \"Not all humans are asleep\". This is equivalent to \"At least one human is not asleep\".\n*   The statement is \"P just in case Q\", which means (P <=> Q).\n*   If P is true (\"Every human is asleep\"), then Q (\"Not all humans are asleep\") must be false. So (P <=> Q) would be (True <=> False), which is False.\n*   If P is false (\"Not every human is asleep\", i.e., \"At least one human is not asleep\"), then Q (\"Not all humans are asleep\") must be true. So (P <=> Q) would be (False <=> True), which is False.\n*   In either case, the statement (P <=> Q) is always false.\n*   Therefore, this statement is a logical contradiction and can never be true. Statement 4 is **FALSE**.\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred and Lewis ate.**\n\n*   We already established that we cannot determine if \"Alfred ate\" (Statement 3) is true.\n*   We have no information whatsoever about whether Lewis ate.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Alfred and Lewis ate\" must be true. Statement 5 is **NOT NECESSARILY TRUE**.\n\n**Statement 6: Every human is happy and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\n*   \"Every human is happy\": This is directly stated in (3). So, this part is TRUE.\n*   \"Lewis isn't a donkey\": This is equivalent to \"It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey\", which is directly stated in (7). So, this part is TRUE.\n*   Since both parts of the conjunction are true, the entire statement 6 is **TRUE**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

It *does not* tell us that if you pick any donkey and any human, the donkey chased the human.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **There is a donkey that every human chased.**\n    *   From the premise \"Every human chased every donkey,\" we know that for *any* donkey 'd', *every* human 'h' chased 'd'.\n    *   Since there is at least one donkey, let's call it 'd1'.\n    *   According to the premise, every human chased 'd1'.\n    *   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\n3.  **A donkey chased a human.**\n    *   Similar to statement 1, the premise only tells us about humans chasing donkeys, not donkeys chasing humans.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **No donkeys chased every human.**\n    *   This statement is about donkeys chasing humans. The premise doesn't give us information about donkeys chasing humans. It's possible that some donkeys chased some humans, or no donkeys chased any humans, or some donkeys chased every human. We cannot deduce this from the given information.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **A donkey chased every human.**\n    *   Similar to statement 1 and 3, the premise doesn't give us information about donkeys chasing humans.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **Every donkey chased a human.**\n    *   Similar to statement 1, 3, 4, and 5, the premise doesn't give us information about donkeys chasing humans.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion based on the primary premise:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the premise \"Every human chased every donkey\" and the existence of at least one donkey is statement 2. The other two conditional statements (\"Not all humans chased Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Lewis\" and \"Not all donkeys drank just in case no donkeys chased Alfred\") do not provide information relevant to the chasing relationship between humans and donkeys in a general sense, nor do they contradict or support any of the listed statements about general chasing. They introduce specific individuals (Lewis, Alfred) and other actions (seeing, drinking) that are not part of the core \"chased\" relationship being tested in the options.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Donkey Kicking Rule:** Every donkey kicked a donkey. (This is a crucial starting point).\n4.  **Alfred/Human/Lewis:** Alfred is not a human unless every donkey kicked Lewis. (\u00acH(Alfred) OR (\u2200d\u2208D, Kicked(d, Lewis))).\n5.  **Human/Hazel/Lewis:** A human chased Hazel only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis. (\u2203h\u2208H, Chased(h, Hazel) \u2192 \u00acChased(Lewis, Lewis)).\n6.  **Lewis/Donkey/Hazel/Alfred/Monkey:** If Lewis is a donkey, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis. (D(Lewis) \u2192 (Kicked(Hazel, Alfred) \u2192 (\u2200m\u2208M, Kicked(m, Lewis)))).\n7.  **Donkeys/Alfred/Hazel:** Not all donkeys kicked Alfred AND Hazel is a monkey. (\u00ac(\u2200d\u2208D, Kicked(d, Alfred)) AND M(Hazel)).\n\n**Analysis of the Given Information:**\n\nFrom point 3: \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\"\nLet D be the set of donkeys.\nThis means for every donkey 'd' in D, there exists at least one donkey 'd'' in D such that 'd' kicked 'd''.\nSymbolically: \u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203d' \u2208 D such that Kicked(d, d').\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: No donkeys kicked every donkey.**\nThis means: \u00ac(\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2200d' \u2208 D, Kicked(d, d')).\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The given information \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" only guarantees that each donkey kicked *at least one* donkey, not that no donkey kicked *all* donkeys. It's possible for one donkey to have kicked every other donkey (including itself).\n\n**Statement 2: There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.**\nThis means: \u2203d' \u2208 D, \u2200d \u2208 D, Kicked(d, d').\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The given information \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" means each donkey *performed* a kick on *some* donkey. It doesn't mean there's a specific donkey that *received* a kick from *every* donkey.\n\n**Statement 3: A donkey kicked a donkey.**\nThis means: \u2203d \u2208 D, \u2203d' \u2208 D, Kicked(d, d').\nThis statement **must be true**.\nWe are given: \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\"\nSince there is \"at least one of each\" (including donkeys), let 'd_0' be a donkey.\nAccording to the rule, 'd_0' kicked a donkey.\nTherefore, there exists a donkey ('d_0') that kicked a donkey (the one 'd_0' kicked).\nThis is a direct consequence of \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" and the existence of at least one donkey.\n\n**Statement 4: Every donkey kicked every donkey.**\nThis means: \u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200d' \u2208 D, Kicked(d, d').\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The given information \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" only states that each donkey kicked *at least one* donkey, not *all* donkeys.\n\n**Statement 5: No donkeys kicked a donkey.**\nThis means: \u00ac(\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2203d' \u2208 D, Kicked(d, d')).\nThis statement is the direct opposite of Statement 3. Since Statement 3 must be true, Statement 5 **must be false**.\n\n**Statement 6: A donkey kicked every donkey.**\nThis means: \u2203d \u2208 D, \u2200d' \u2208 D, Kicked(d, d').\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Similar to Statement 1, the given information doesn't guarantee that one specific donkey kicked all other donkeys.\n\n**Revisiting the core deduction:**\n\nThe statement \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203d' \u2208 D, Kicked(d, d')) combined with the fact that there is \"at least one of each\" (meaning D is not empty) directly implies that there exists at least one donkey that kicked at least one donkey.\n\nLet's consider the other complex conditions. Do they affect the truth of \"A donkey kicked a donkey\"?\nNo. The statement \"A donkey kicked a donkey\" is a direct and immediate consequence of \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" and the existence of donkeys. The other conditions (Alfred, Lewis, Hazel, humans, monkeys) do not negate or alter the fundamental kicking relationship among donkeys.\n\nFor example, if D = {d1, d2}, and \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" means:\nd1 kicked d1 (or d2)\nd2 kicked d1 (or d2)\nThis immediately implies that there is at least one instance of a donkey kicking a donkey.\n\nTherefore, Statement 3 is the only one that must be true based on the provided information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

But (2) states that no donkeys kicked every human.\n* Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey.\n* **Deduction 1: Lewis isn't a donkey.** (This directly addresses statement 1)\n\n**From Deduction 1 and (4):**\n* We know Lewis isn't a donkey.\n* Statement (4) is: $(\\forall x, \\text{Drank}(x) \\implies x \\in D) \\lor (\\forall d \\in D, K(d, \\text{Lewis}))$\n* Let's consider the first part of the disjunction: \"Only donkeys drank\" ($\\forall x, \\text{Drank}(x) \\implies x \\in D$).\n    * If Lewis drank, then according to this part, Lewis must be a donkey.\n    * But we just deduced that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n    * Therefore, if the first part of the disjunction is true, then Lewis cannot have drank. ($\\neg \\text{Drank}(\\text{Lewis})$)\n* Let's consider the second part of the disjunction: \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" ($\\forall d \\in D, K(d, \\text{Lewis})$).\n* So, we have: $(\\neg \\text{Drank}(\\text{Lewis})) \\lor (\\forall d \\in D, K(d, \\text{Lewis}))$\n\n**From (5):**\n* $(\\forall d \\in D, \\neg \\text{Chased}(d, \\text{Alfred})) \\implies (\\neg \\text{Chased}(\\text{Lewis}, \\text{Lewis}))$\n* This statement is a conditional. If the antecedent is true, the consequent must be true. If the consequent is false, the antecedent must be false.\n* It doesn't directly tell us anything about drinking.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the options based on Deduction 1:**\n\n1.  **Lewis isn't a donkey.** **TRUE** (Proven by comparing (2) and (3)).\n\nNow, let's see if we can determine anything about drinking.\n\nWe have: $(\\neg \\text{Drank}(\\text{Lewis})) \\lor (\\forall d \\in D, K(d, \\text{Lewis}))$\n\nCan we determine if Lewis drank or not?\nWhat if Lewis is a human or a monkey?\nIf Lewis is a human, then Lewis is not a donkey.\nIf Lewis is a monkey, then Lewis is not a donkey.\n\nThe problem doesn't give us any information to definitively choose between the two parts of the disjunction from (4).\n* If \"Only donkeys drank\" is true, then Lewis didn't drink (since Lewis isn't a donkey).\n* If \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" is true, then Lewis might or might not have drank.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Lewis drank.\nIf Lewis drank, then the first part of the disjunction in (4) (\"Only donkeys drank\") must be false, because Lewis isn't a donkey.\nTherefore, the second part of the disjunction must be true: \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" ($\\forall d \\in D, K(d, \\text{Lewis})$).\nSo, if Lewis drank, then $\\forall d \\in D, K(d, \\text{Lewis})$. This is consistent.\n\nCan we prove Lewis drank? Or Lewis didn't drink?\nThe statement (5) \"No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" seems to be a distractor or to imply something about the nature of Lewis (e.g., if Lewis is a human, it might be less likely for Lewis to chase Lewis, but this is not a logical deduction). It doesn't connect to drinking.\n\nLet's assume for a moment that Lewis didn't drink. This is consistent with the first part of (4) being true.\nLet's assume for a moment that Lewis drank. This forces the second part of (4) to be true.\n\nThe problem asks what *must* be true.\n\nWe have definitively proven:\n1.  **Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\nLet's re-examine the options:\n1.  **Lewis isn't a donkey.** (Proven TRUE)\n2.  **Alfred and Lewis drank.** (Cannot be proven. If Lewis didn't drink, this is false. We don't know if Alfred drank.)\n3.  **Lewis is a donkey.** (Proven FALSE)\n4.  **Alfred drank.** (Cannot be proven. No information about Alfred's drinking is given.)\n5.  **Lewis drank.** (Cannot be proven. As discussed, it's possible Lewis didn't drink if \"Only donkeys drank\" is true.)\n6.  **Alfred didn't drink.** (Cannot be proven. No information about Alfred's drinking is given.)\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\nLet's double check the reasoning for Lewis not being a donkey.\nP1: No donkeys kicked every human. ($\\forall d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H, \\neg K(d, h)$)\nP2: Lewis kicked every human. ($\\forall h \\in H, K(\\text{Lewis}, h)$)\n\nAssume Lewis is a donkey.\nIf Lewis is a donkey, then Lewis is an element of D.\nFrom P2, Lewis kicked every human.\nSo, there exists a donkey (Lewis) that kicked every human.\nThis directly contradicts P1, which states that no donkeys kicked every human.\nTherefore, the assumption that Lewis is a donkey must be false.\nConclusion: Lewis is not a donkey. This is solid.\n\nThe other statements about drinking cannot be logically deduced. The statement (4) is a disjunction. If Lewis didn't drink, the first part of the disjunction (\"Only donkeys drank\") could be true, and the second part could be false. If Lewis did drink, the first part of the disjunction must be false (since Lewis isn't a donkey), which means the second part (\"Every donkey kicked Lewis\") must be true. We don't have information to force either scenario.\n\nThe information about chasing (statement 5) is irrelevant to the drinking question.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Is it possible for Lewis to not be a donkey and not drink? Yes, if \"Only donkeys drank\" is true.\n*   Is it possible for Lewis to not be a donkey and drink? Yes, if \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" is true.\n\nSince both scenarios are possible, we cannot definitively say whether Lewis drank or not. Therefore, we cannot say anything about Alfred drinking either.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

No, it's simpler: If H1 saw H2, and H2 saw H1, then H1 saw H1? No. Let's interpret \"Every human saw every human that saw it\" as: For any human X, if there is a human Y such that Y saw X, then X saw Y. This implies a symmetry in seeing among humans, or at least a specific kind of symmetry. If H1 saw H2, and H2 saw H1, then H1 saw H1 and H2 saw H2. This is self-referential. Let's consider the most straightforward interpretation: If H1 is a human, and H2 is a human, and H2 saw H1, then H1 saw H2. This means the \"saw\" relationship among humans is symmetric.

The \"saw\" relationship is not necessarily symmetric for all entities.\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **Statement 5: No donkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   This is the negation of \"A donkey saw Alfred.\"\n    *   Since \"A donkey saw Alfred\" is not necessarily true, its negation is also not necessarily true.

Everything is a donkey (D), or a human (H), or a monkey (M) (exclusively).\n2.  There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  No donkeys saw Lewis. (This is a direct statement)\n4.  Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n5.  It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel. (Hazel did not see Hazel)\n6.  If not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's focus on the statements related to Lewis and donkeys, as that's what the options are about.\n\nFrom point 3 of the given information: **\"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"**\n\nThis statement is a direct and unambiguous fact provided in the problem description.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this fact:\n\n*   **1. No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n    *   \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true (from given info).\n    *   We don't have any information about whether Lewis is a donkey, human, or monkey. The problem states \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey\". Lewis must be one of these. However, the truth of \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" does not depend on Lewis's species. The second part \"Lewis isn't a donkey\" is not necessarily true. Lewis *could* be a donkey, and it would still be true that no donkeys saw Lewis (because if Lewis is a donkey, then Lewis is one of the donkeys that didn't see Lewis). So, this entire statement is not necessarily true because of the second part.\n\n*   **2. Lewis saw every donkey.**\n    *   The given information is \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" This is about donkeys seeing Lewis, not Lewis seeing donkeys. We have no information about what Lewis saw. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **3. A donkey saw Lewis.**\n    *   This directly contradicts the given information \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **4. Lewis saw a donkey.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about what Lewis saw. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **5. Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n    *   If \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" (meaning zero donkeys saw Lewis), then it is certainly true that \"Not all donkeys saw Lewis.\" If zero donkeys saw Lewis, then it's impossible for *all* donkeys to have seen Lewis. This statement is a logical consequence of \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"\n\n*   **6. Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n    *   This directly contradicts the given information \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe statement \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is explicitly given.\nStatement 5, \"Not all donkeys saw Lewis,\" is a logical consequence of \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" If *no* donkeys saw Lewis, then it's impossible for *all* donkeys to have seen Lewis.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

We only know about \"all humans are asleep\" or \"not all humans are asleep\".

Hazel is an individual in this universe, so Hazel must be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\n**Case 1: Hazel is a Human (Hazel $\\in$ H)**\nIf Hazel is a human, then from (4), Hazel saw every human. Since Hazel is herself a human, Hazel saw herself.\nAlso, if Hazel is a human, then \"A human saw Hazel\" (Q) is true (Hazel saw herself).\nAnd \"Every human saw Hazel\" (P) is true (Hazel saw every human, and Hazel is a human).\n\n**Case 2: Hazel is a Donkey (Hazel $\\in$ D)**\nIf Hazel is a donkey, then from (4), Hazel saw every human. This is possible.\nFrom (3), a human kicked every donkey. So, some human kicked Hazel.\nConsider the conditional statement (5): $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies (\\forall m \\in M, S(m, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies \\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel}))$\nIf Hazel is a donkey, then Alfred (who is a human or a monkey or a donkey) might or might not have kicked Hazel.\nIf Alfred is a human, then Alfred kicked Hazel (because Hazel is a donkey and a human kicked every donkey). So $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ would be false, making the implication (5) vacuously true.\nIf Alfred is a monkey or a donkey, then Alfred cannot kick Hazel (only humans kick donkeys). So $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ would be true. In this case, $(\\forall m \\in M, S(m, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies \\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel}))$ must be true.\n\n**Case 3: Hazel is a Monkey (Hazel $\\in$ M)**\nIf Hazel is a monkey, then from (4), Hazel saw every human. This is possible.\nConsider the conditional statement (5): $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies (\\forall m \\in M, S(m, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies \\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel}))$\nIf Alfred is a human, donkey, or monkey, Alfred might or might not have kicked Hazel. Kicking is only defined for humans kicking donkeys. So, if Hazel is a monkey, no one kicked Hazel. Therefore, $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ is always true.\nThis means that $(\\forall m \\in M, S(m, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies \\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel}))$ must be true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the kicking rule: \"A human kicked every donkey.\" This means $K(h, d)$ is true for some $h \\in H$ and all $d \\in D$. It doesn't say anything about kicking non-donkeys. It also doesn't say anything about non-humans kicking. So, if $y$ is not a donkey, or $x$ is not a human, then $K(x, y)$ is false.\n\nLet's refine the kicking rule:\n$K(x, y)$ is true if and only if $x \\in H$, $y \\in D$, AND for every $d \\in D$, there exists some $h \\in H$ such that $K(h, d)$.\nThis means if $y$ is not a donkey, then $K(x, y)$ is false for any $x$.\nIf $x$ is not a human, then $K(x, y)$ is false for any $y$.\n\nNow let's re-evaluate the premise $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel})$.\n\n*   **If Hazel is a Donkey:**\n    *   If Alfred is a human ($A \\in H$), then Alfred kicked Hazel (since Hazel is a donkey and a human kicked every donkey). So $K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ is true. Thus $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ is false. The implication (5) is vacuously true.\n    *   If Alfred is not a human ($A \\notin H$, so $A \\in D$ or $A \\in M$), then Alfred cannot kick Hazel (only humans kick). So $K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ is false. Thus $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ is true. In this case, $(\\forall m \\in M, S(m, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies \\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel}))$ must be true.\n\n*   **If Hazel is a Human or a Monkey:**\n    *   Hazel is not a donkey. Therefore, no one can kick Hazel (kicking is only defined for donkeys as the recipient). So $K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ is false, regardless of who Alfred is.\n    *   Thus $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ is true.\n    *   Therefore, $(\\forall m \\in M, S(m, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies \\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel}))$ must be true.\n\n**Conclusion from the conditional statement (5):**\n\n*   If Hazel is a human or a monkey, then $(\\forall m \\in M, S(m, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies \\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel}))$ must be true.\n*   If Hazel is a donkey AND Alfred is not a human, then $(\\forall m \\in M, S(m, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies \\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel}))$ must be true.\n*   If Hazel is a donkey AND Alfred is a human, then the conditional (5) is vacuously true, and we learn nothing new about the seeing relationship.\n\nLet's consider the statements:\n\n**1. Every human saw Hazel.** ($\\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel})$)\nLet's call this statement P.\n\n**2. No humans saw Hazel.** ($\\forall h \\in H, \\neg S(h, \\text{Hazel})$)\n\n**3. Not all humans saw Hazel.** ($\\exists h \\in H, \\neg S(h, \\text{Hazel})$) (This is the negation of statement 1)\n\n**5. A human saw Hazel.** ($\\exists h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel})$) (This is the negation of statement 2)\n\n**6. Hazel saw a human.** ($\\exists h \\in H, S(\\text{Hazel}, h)$)\nFrom (4), \"Hazel saw every human.\" Since there's at least one human ($|H| \\ge 1$), this means Hazel saw at least one human. So, statement 6 **must be true**.\n\nNow let's focus on statements 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\nConsider the implication: $(\\forall m \\in M, S(m, \\text{Hazel}) \\implies \\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel}))$.\nLet's call the antecedent $M_S$ (Monkeys saw Hazel) and the consequent $H_S$ (Humans saw Hazel). So $M_S \\implies H_S$.\n\nIf $H_S$ is true, then statement 1 is true.\nIf $H_S$ is false, then statement 3 is true.\n\nWhat if $M_S$ is false? Then $M_S \\implies H_S$ is true regardless of $H_S$.\nWhat if $M_S$ is true? Then $H_S$ must be true.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for Hazel's identity:\n\n**Scenario A: Hazel is a Human.**\n*   From (4), Hazel saw every human. Since Hazel is a human, Hazel saw herself.\n*   Therefore, $\\exists h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel})$ is true (Hazel saw herself). So statement 5 is true.\n*   Also, $\\forall h \\in H, S(h, \\text{Hazel})$ is true (Hazel saw every human, and Hazel is a human, so every human saw Hazel). So statement 1 is true.\n*   If statement 1 is true, then statement 3 is false, and statement 2 is false.\n*   In this scenario, $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ is true (Hazel is not a donkey). So $M_S \\implies H_S$ must be true. Since $H_S$ (statement 1) is true, this is consistent.\n\n**Scenario B: Hazel is a Monkey.**\n*   From (4), Hazel saw every human.\n*   $\\neg K(A, \\text{Hazel})$ is true (Hazel is not a donkey). So $M_S \\implies H_S$ must be true.\n*   Can we determine if $H_S$ (statement 1) is true or false?\n    *   If $M_S$ is true (every monkey saw Hazel), then $H_S$ (every human saw Hazel) must be true.\n    *   If $M_S$ is false (not every monkey saw Hazel),",

Everything is a donkey (D), or a human (H), or a monkey (M) (exclusively).\n2.  There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  No humans saw a human that saw it. (This implies that if A is human and B is human, and A saw B, then B did not see A. Or, more strongly, there's no chain H1 -> H2 -> H1).\n4.  No donkeys saw Lewis.\n5.  Every human saw Alfred.\n6.  Every monkey kicked Lewis.\n7.  Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n*   **From (7) Lewis isn't a donkey, and (1) Everything is D, H, or M:**\n    Lewis must be either a human (H) or a monkey (M).\n\n*   **Consider Lewis's type based on (4) and (6):**\n    *   **Case 1: Lewis is a Human (H).**\n        *   If Lewis is human, then from (4) \"No donkeys saw Lewis\", this is consistent.\n        *   If Lewis is human, then from (6) \"Every monkey kicked Lewis\", this is consistent.\n        *   Now, let's use (3) \"No humans saw a human that saw it.\"\n            *   If Lewis is human, and every human saw Alfred (from 5), then if Alfred is also human, we have a potential conflict.\n            *   If Lewis (H) saw Alfred (H), then Alfred (H) cannot have seen Lewis (H).\n            *   However, (5) states \"Every human saw Alfred\". This means Lewis (being human) saw Alfred.\n            *   If Alfred is human, then Lewis saw Alfred. For (3) to hold, Alfred cannot have seen Lewis. But (5) says *every* human saw Alfred, not that Alfred saw every human. So this doesn't immediately rule out Alfred being human.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Lewis is a Monkey (M).**\n        *   If Lewis is a monkey, then from (4) \"No donkeys saw Lewis\", this is consistent.\n        *   If Lewis is a monkey, then from (6) \"Every monkey kicked Lewis\". This means Lewis (being a monkey) kicked himself. This is possible.\n\n*   **Focus on Alfred's type using (5) and (3):**\n    *   (5) \"Every human saw Alfred.\"\n    *   (3) \"No humans saw a human that saw it.\"\n\n    Let H1 be any human. H1 saw Alfred.\n    If Alfred were a human, then H1 saw Alfred (H).\n    According to (3), if H1 saw Alfred (H), then Alfred (H) cannot have seen H1.\n    But (5) says *every* human saw Alfred. This means if Alfred is human, then Alfred (being a human) must have seen Alfred. This is a self-referential loop.\n    If Alfred is human, then Alfred saw Alfred. This violates (3) \"No humans saw a human that saw it\" if \"it\" refers to the human who saw them.\n    Let's rephrase (3): For any two distinct humans A and B, if A saw B, then B did not see A. Or, more simply, there are no pairs (A, B) such that A saw B and B saw A. And no human saw themselves.\n    If Alfred is human, then Alfred is a human. And (5) says \"Every human saw Alfred\". So, Alfred (being a human) saw Alfred.\n    This means Alfred saw a human (himself) that saw him (himself). This directly contradicts (3) \"No humans saw a human that saw it.\"\n    Therefore, **Alfred cannot be a human.**\n\n*   **Since Alfred cannot be a human, and everything is D, H, or M:**\n    Alfred must be either a donkey (D) or a monkey (M).\n\n*   **Let's re-evaluate Lewis based on Alfred not being human:**\n    *   We know Lewis is H or M.\n    *   We know Alfred is D or M.\n\n    Consider the statement \"Every human saw Alfred.\"\n    If Alfred is a monkey, then every human saw a monkey. This is consistent.\n    If Alfred is a donkey, then every human saw a donkey. This is consistent.\n\n    Consider \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"\n    If Lewis is a human, no donkeys saw a human. Consistent.\n    If Lewis is a monkey, no donkeys saw a monkey. Consistent.\n\n    Consider \"Every monkey kicked Lewis.\"\n    If Lewis is a human, every monkey kicked a human. Consistent.\n    If Lewis is a monkey, every monkey kicked a monkey (including possibly themselves). Consistent.\n\n    The crucial deduction was that Alfred cannot be a human.\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n1.  **Alfred isn't a human.**\n    *   Based on our deduction from (3) and (5), this **must be true**. If Alfred were human, then Alfred (being human) saw Alfred (being human), which violates \"No humans saw a human that saw it.\"\n\n2.  **Alfred is a donkey.**\n    *   We know Alfred isn't human. So Alfred is either a donkey or a monkey. We don't have enough information to definitively say Alfred *must* be a donkey. Alfred could be a monkey.\n\n3.  **Lewis is a donkey.**\n    *   This contradicts (7) \"Lewis isn't a donkey.\" So this **must be false**.\n\n4.  **Alfred isn't a donkey.**\n    *   We know Alfred isn't human. So Alfred is either a donkey or a monkey. If Alfred isn't a donkey, then Alfred must be a monkey. We don't have enough information to definitively say Alfred *must* be a monkey (i.e., isn't a donkey).\n\n5.  **Alfred is a human.**\n    *   This contradicts our deduction that Alfred cannot be a human. So this **must be false**.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is that Alfred isn't a human.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

Alfred could be a human, donkey, or monkey, or none of these (if Alfred is not \"everything\"). The problem states \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey\". So Alfred must be one of these.\n    *   If Alfred is a human, we know nothing about human happiness.\n    *   If Alfred is a donkey, we know donkeys are happy unless no humans are hungry. We don't know if humans are hungry.\n    *   If Alfred is a monkey, we know nothing about monkey happiness.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot conclude Alfred is happy.\n\n*   **Option 2: A human chased Alfred.**\n    *   From statement 4: \"Every human chased Alfred\".\n    *   Since there is at least one human (statement 1), it follows that *a* human chased Alfred.\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **Option 3: Alfred chased a human.**\n    *   We know humans chased Alfred, but not necessarily the other way around. We have no information about Alfred chasing anyone.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot conclude Alfred chased a human.\n\n*   **Option 4: Not all humans chased Alfred.**\n    *   From statement 4: \"Every human chased Alfred\".\n    *   This statement is the direct negation of \"Not all humans chased Alfred\".\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **Option 5: Alfred chased every human.**\n    *   Similar to option 3, we have no information about Alfred chasing humans, let alone every human.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot conclude Alfred chased every human.\n\n*   **Option 6: No humans chased Alfred.**\n    *   From statement 4: \"Every human chased Alfred\".\n    *   Since there is at least one human, this means at least one human *did* chase Alfred.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n---\n\nLet's double-check if any other statements contradict our findings or provide more insight.\n\nWe established that \"A human chased Alfred\" (Option 2) must be true based on statement 4.\n\nNow consider statement 6: \"A human saw Alfred if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n*   We know \"A human chased Alfred\" is true. This is *not* \"A human saw Alfred\". These are different actions.\n*   So, we cannot directly use statement 6 to confirm or deny anything about \"A human saw Alfred\" or \"No donkeys chased Alfred\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate the implications of \"Every human chased Alfred\" (from statement 4).\nThis means: $\\forall h \\in H, h \\text{ chased Alfred}$.\n\nConsider the options again with this strong piece of information:\n\n1.  **Alfred is happy.** (No info)\n2.  **A human chased Alfred.** (Directly implied by \"Every human chased Alfred\" and \"there's at least one human\"). **TRUE.**\n3.  **Alfred chased a human.** (No info)\n4.  **Not all humans chased Alfred.** (Contradicts \"Every human chased Alfred\"). **FALSE.**\n5.  **Alfred chased every human.** (No info)\n6.  **No humans chased Alfred.** (Contradicts \"Every human chased Alfred\" and \"there's at least one human\"). **FALSE.**\n\nThe other statements (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) seem to be red herrings or provide information that doesn't directly impact the truth of the options given the very strong statement 4. For example, the information about Lewis, hungry humans, or monkeys seeing donkeys doesn't change the fact that \"Every human chased Alfred\".\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true among the options is \"A human chased Alfred\".\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Hazel is a human.**\n    *   We concluded that Hazel is not a human.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **False**.\n\n**3. Alfred will attack.**\n    *   Let's re-examine Rule 3: \u00acA_attack => (\u00ac(All D kicked H) => All M saw H)\n    *   This is a complex conditional. Let P = \u00acA_attack, Q = \u00ac(All D kicked H), R = All M saw H.\n    *   The rule is P => (Q => R).\n    *   This is logically equivalent to P => (\u00acQ or R).\n    *   This is also logically equivalent to \u00acP or (\u00acQ or R).\n    *   This is also logically equivalent to (P and Q) => R.\n    *   We don't have enough information to definitively conclude whether Alfred will attack or not. The truth of this statement depends on the truth values of \"All D kicked H\" and \"All M saw H\", which are not provided.\n    *   For example, if (\u00ac(All D kicked H) => All M saw H) is true, then \u00acA_attack could be true or false.\n    *   If (\u00ac(All D kicked H) => All M saw H) is false, then \u00acA_attack *must* be false, meaning A_attack *must* be true.\n    *   However, we don't know the truth value of (\u00ac(All D kicked H) => All M saw H).\n    *   Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Alfred will attack.

Hazel isn't a human.**\n    *   As concluded earlier, based on Rule 1 and Rule 2, Hazel cannot be a human.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **True**.\n\n**6.

(m -> d, and d -> m). This implies a reciprocal kicking relationship.\n4.  **Monkey-Monkey Interaction:** A monkey (m1) chased a monkey (m2) that chased a monkey (m3). (m1 -> m2 -> m3). This means there's a chain of at least two \"chased\" relationships among monkeys.\n5.  **Conditional (Hazel):** If every monkey chased Hazel (H), then Hazel kicked Alfred (A) only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n    *   Let P = \"Every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n    *   Let Q = \"Hazel kicked Alfred.\"\n    *   Let R = \"No monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n    *   The statement is: P -> (Q only if R) which is P -> (Q -> R).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to Determine Truth:**\n\nWe need to find which of the given statements *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 1: A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n*   This means there exists at least one donkey (d) such that for every monkey (m), d kicked m.\n*   From rule 3, every monkey kicked *a* donkey that kicked *it*. This doesn't mean one specific donkey kicked *all* monkeys. It's possible that monkey M1 kicked D1 (and D1 kicked M1), and M2 kicked D2 (and D2 kicked M2), where D1 and D2 are different donkeys.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every donkey kicked a monkey.**\n*   This means for every donkey (d), there exists at least one monkey (m) such that d kicked m.\n*   From rule 3, \"Every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\" This means for every monkey (m), there's a donkey (d) such that m kicked d AND d kicked m.\n*   Since there's at least one monkey, and every monkey has this reciprocal kicking relationship with *some* donkey, it implies that every donkey that *was kicked by a monkey* also kicked that monkey.\n*   However, are there donkeys that *weren't* kicked by any monkey? The rule only states what monkeys do. It doesn't say anything about donkeys that aren't involved in this reciprocal kicking.\n*   Consider a scenario: Monkey M1 kicked Donkey D1 (and D1 kicked M1). There's also Donkey D2, which was never kicked by any monkey. In this case, D2 did not kick a monkey.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: No donkeys kicked every monkey.**\n*   This means it is *not* the case that there exists a donkey (d) such that d kicked every monkey (m). In other words, for every donkey (d), there is at least one monkey (m) that d did *not* kick.\n*   This is the negation of Statement 1. If Statement 1 is not necessarily true, then its negation might be true, or it might also not be necessarily true.\n*   Let's re-evaluate Statement 1. Is it *possible* for a donkey to kick every monkey? Yes, if there's only one donkey and it's involved in the reciprocal kicking with all monkeys, or if one donkey happens to be the reciprocal kicker for all monkeys.\n*   Since Statement 1 is not *necessarily* true, its negation (Statement 3) is also not *necessarily* true. It's possible for a donkey to kick every monkey (making Statement 1 true and Statement 3 false), and it's possible for no single donkey to kick every monkey (making Statement 1 false and Statement 3 true). We don't have enough information to definitively say one way or the other.\n\n**Statement 4: Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n*   This means for every donkey (d) and every monkey (m), d kicked m.\n*   This is a very strong statement. Rule 3 only guarantees that *every monkey* kicked *a* donkey that kicked *it*. It doesn't say that *every donkey* kicked *every monkey*.\n*   For example, if M1 kicked D1 (and D1 kicked M1), and M2 kicked D2 (and D2 kicked M2), it's not necessarily true that D1 kicked M2 or that D2 kicked M1.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n*   This means there exists at least one donkey (d) and at least one monkey (m) such that d kicked m.\n*   From rule 2, we know there is at least one monkey (M) and at least one donkey (D).\n*   From rule 3, \"Every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\"\n*   Let's pick any monkey, say M_x (we know at least one exists). According to rule 3, M_x kicked *a* donkey (let's call it D_y) AND D_y kicked M_x.\n*   Since D_y kicked M_x, this directly fulfills the condition \"A donkey kicked a monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 6: No donkeys kicked a monkey.**\n*   This means for every donkey (d) and every monkey (m), d did *not* kick m. In other words, no donkey ever kicked any monkey.\n*   This is the direct negation of Statement 5.\n*   Since Statement 5 *must* be true, its negation (Statement 6) *must* be false.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true (in fact, it's necessarily false).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(This means for every 'x' that is a donkey, Hazel chased 'x').\n*   **Donkey's Perception:** Not all donkeys saw Hazel. (This means there exists at least one donkey that did not see Hazel).\n*   **Hazel's Perception:** Hazel saw Hazel.

This statement contradicts the given information.\n    *   **False.**\n\n2.  **Hazel chased a donkey.**\n    *   We are told: \"Hazel chased every donkey.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one donkey, and Hazel chased *every* donkey, it logically follows that Hazel chased *a* donkey.\n    *   **True.**\n\n3.  **Every donkey chased Hazel.**\n    *   We are told: \"Hazel chased every donkey.\" This means Hazel is the one doing the chasing.\n    *   This statement implies that *donkeys* are doing the chasing. We have no information to support this.\n    *   **False.**\n\n4.  **A donkey chased Hazel.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, this implies that a donkey is doing the chasing. We have no information to support this.\n    *   **False.**\n\n5.  **No donkeys chased Hazel.**\n    *   Similar to statements 3 and 4, this is about donkeys doing the chasing. We have no information about donkeys chasing Hazel. It's possible, but not necessarily true. It's also possible that *some* donkeys chased Hazel. We simply don't know.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n6.  **Hazel is hungry.**\n    *   From our analysis of the conditional statement, we know: \"If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel is hungry.\"\n    *   However, we are *not* given any information that \"every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n    *   Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel is hungry. The truth of the antecedent (\"every monkey chased Hazel\") is unknown.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**Revisiting the conditional statement's implication:**\n\nThe crucial part is \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is hungry.\"\nSince \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true, we must conclude:\n\"Every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is hungry.\"\nThis means: \"If (every monkey chased Hazel), then (Hazel is hungry).\"\n\nWe are not told that \"every monkey chased Hazel.\" Therefore, we cannot deduce that \"Hazel is hungry.\"\n\nLet's double-check the interpretation of \"A only if B\". It means B is a necessary condition for A. So, if A is true, then B must be true. If B is false, then A must be false. But if B is true, A is not necessarily true.\n\nIn our case, A = \"every monkey chased Hazel\", B = \"Hazel is hungry\".\nWe have \"If A, then B\".\nWe don't know if A is true.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Everything is a donkey (D), or a human (H), or a monkey (M) (exclusively).** This means the sets D, H, M form a partition of the universe.\n2.  **There's at least one of each.** |D| >= 1, |H| >= 1, |M| >= 1.\n3.  **No donkeys chased a donkey.** This is a crucial negative statement. Let C(x, y) mean \"x chased y\".\n    *   For all d1 in D, for all d2 in D, NOT C(d1, d2).\n4.  **A monkey chased a donkey.**\n    *   There exists m in M, there exists d in D, such that C(m, d).\n5.  **Alfred didn't chase Alfred.** NOT C(Alfred, Alfred).\n6.  **Lewis isn't a donkey.** Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n7.  **Every monkey will run (R(m)) or it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.**\n    *   For all m in M, R(m) OR (Lewis is NOT a donkey).\n    *   Since we already know Lewis isn't a donkey (from point 6), the second part of the disjunction is true. This means the entire statement \"Every monkey will run or it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey\" is true *regardless* of whether monkeys run. This statement doesn't give us new information about chasing relationships or the nature of donkeys, humans, or monkeys beyond what we already know about Lewis. It's a bit of a red herring for the chasing logic.\n8.  **No humans chased Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n    *   (NOT (There exists h in H such that C(h, Hazel))) IMPLIES (For all m in M, K(m, Lewis)).\n    *   This is a conditional statement. It doesn't tell us directly about chasing unless we know the truth value of its components.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to be Evaluated:**\n\nLet's use the crucial piece of information: **\"No donkeys chased a donkey.\"** This means that for any donkey x and any donkey y, x did not chase y.\n\n1.  **A donkey chased every donkey.**\n    *   This means: There exists d1 in D such that for all d2 in D, C(d1, d2).\n    *   However, we know that for any d1 in D and any d2 in D, NOT C(d1, d2).\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n2.  **There is a donkey that every donkey chased.**\n    *   This means: There exists d2 in D such that for all d1 in D, C(d1, d2).\n    *   Again, we know that for any d1 in D and any d2 in D, NOT C(d1, d2).\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n3.  **A donkey chased a donkey.**\n    *   This means: There exists d1 in D, there exists d2 in D, such that C(d1, d2).\n    *   This is the direct negation of \"No donkeys chased a donkey.\"\n    *   Since \"No donkeys chased a donkey\" is given as true, its negation **must be false**.\n\n4.  **Every donkey chased every donkey.**\n    *   This means: For all d1 in D, for all d2 in D, C(d1, d2).\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No donkeys chased a donkey.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n5.  **A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.**\n    *   This means: There exists d1 in D such that for all d2 in D, if C(d2, d1), then C(d1, d2).\n    *   Let's consider the premise \"C(d2, d1)\". If d1 and d2 are both donkeys, then C(d2, d1) is false because \"No donkeys chased a donkey.\"\n    *   So, the antecedent \"C(d2, d1)\" (where d1 and d2 are donkeys) is always false.\n    *   In logic, \"False IMPLIES X\" is always true.\n    *   Therefore, for any d1 in D, and any d2 in D, the conditional \"if C(d2, d1) then C(d1, d2)\" is true.\n    *   Since this holds for *every* donkey d1 (and every donkey d2), and we know there's at least one donkey, we can pick any donkey for d1.\n    *   Thus, this statement **must be true**.\n\n6.  **Every donkey chased a donkey.**\n    *   This means: For all d1 in D, there exists d2 in D, such that C(d1, d2).\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No donkeys chased a donkey.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the given information, particularly \"No donkeys chased a donkey,\" only statement 5 can be true. The other statements are direct contradictions or implications of the direct contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(Let's call this human 'H_kicked').\n    *   Formal: $\\exists h \\in H \\text{ s.t. } \\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ kicked } h$.\n*   **Rule 2:** Every human chased every donkey that chased every donkey.\n    *   This statement is a bit convoluted. Let's parse \"every donkey that chased every donkey.\" This implies a donkey 'd1' that chased *all* other donkeys 'd2'. If there's only one donkey, it chased itself. If there are multiple, it's a very specific donkey.\n    *   Let's assume it means: $\\forall h \\in H, \\forall d_1 \\in D \\text{ s.t. } (\\forall d_2 \\in D, d_1 \\text{ chased } d_2)$, then $h \\text{ chased } d_1$.\n*   **Rule 3:** No donkeys saw Lewis.\n    *   Formal: $\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ did not see Lewis}$.\n*   **Rule 4:** Lewis saw Alfred.\n    *   Formal: Lewis saw Alfred.\n*   **Rule 5:** Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n    *   Formal: $(\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ saw Hazel}) \\implies (\\text{Lewis chased Lewis})$.\n*   **Rule 6:** No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a monkey ate.\n    *   Formal: $(\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ did not chase Alfred}) \\iff (\\exists m \\in M, m \\text{ ate})$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to be Evaluated:**\n\nLet's re-examine the core statements we need to evaluate for truth.\n\n1.  **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ kicked } h$.\n    *   From Rule 1, we know there exists *one specific human* ($H_kicked$) that every donkey kicked. This does *not* mean every donkey kicked *every* human.

This is the opposite direction. Rule 1 says *every donkey* kicked *a specific human*. This statement says *a specific donkey* kicked *every human*. We have no information to support this.\n    *   **False.**\n\n3.  **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H \\text{ s.t. } d \\text{ kicked } h$.\n    *   From Rule 1: \"There is a human that every donkey kicked.\" Let's call this human $H_kicked$.\n    *   This means for any donkey $d_1$, $d_1$ kicked $H_kicked$.\n    *   Since $H_kicked$ is a human, it follows that for every donkey, there exists *at least one* human (namely $H_kicked$) that it kicked.\n    *   **True.**\n\n4.  **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n    *   Let P be \"Every human is asleep.\"\n    *   Let Q be \"Not all humans are asleep.\" (This is equivalent to \"There is at least one human not asleep.\")\n    *   The statement is P $\\iff$ Q.\n    *   If P is true, then Q must be false (because if every human is asleep, it's not true that not all humans are asleep).\n    *   If P is false, then Q must be true (because if not every human is asleep, then there is at least one human not asleep).\n    *   For P $\\iff$ Q to be true, P and Q must have the same truth value.\n    *   However, P and Q are logically contradictory. P is \"$\\forall h, h \\text{ is asleep}$\" and Q is \"$\\exists h, h \\text{ is not asleep}$\". P is the negation of Q.\n    *   Therefore, P $\\iff$ Q can never be true. It would mean (True $\\iff$ False) or (False $\\iff$ True), both of which are false.\n    *   This statement is a logical contradiction and has nothing to do with the specific rules of the problem.\n    *   **False.**\n\n5.  **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n    *   This means: $\\neg (\\exists d \\in D \\text{ s.t. } \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n    *   This is the negation of statement 2.\n    *   Since we determined statement 2 is false (we have no information to support it), its negation must be true.\n    *   **True.**\n\n6.  **No donkeys kicked a human.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall d \\in D, \\neg (\\exists h \\in H \\text{ s.t. } d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n    *   This is equivalent to: $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ did not kick } h$.\n    *   This is the negation of statement 3.\n    *   Since we determined statement 3 is true, its negation must be false.\n    *   **False.**\n\n**Summary of Truth Values:**\n\n1.

A donkey kicked a human.**\n*   This statement claims: $\\exists d \\exists h (d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n*   Rule 1 states: $\\forall d \\forall h \\neg (d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n*   Rule 1 explicitly says that for *any* donkey and *any* human, the donkey did *not* kick the human. This directly contradicts the idea that *a* donkey kicked *a* human.\n*   **Conclusion: False.**\n\n**4. Every donkey kicked a human.**\n*   This statement claims: $\\forall d \\exists h (d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n*   Rule 1 states: $\\forall d \\forall h \\neg (d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n*   If no donkeys kicked a human (Rule 1), then it's impossible for every donkey to have kicked *a* human.

There is not a human that every donkey kicked.**\n*   This statement claims: $\\neg \\exists h \\forall d (d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n*   This is equivalent to: $\\forall h \\neg \\forall d (d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n*   This is also equivalent to: $\\forall h \\exists d \\neg (d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n*   Let's look at Rule 1: \"No donkeys kicked a human.\" This means $\\forall d \\forall h \\neg (d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n*   If Rule 1 is true, then for any human 'h', and for any donkey 'd', 'd kicked h' is false.\n*   Therefore, for any human 'h', it is true that there is no donkey 'd' that kicked 'h'.\n*   This implies that there cannot be a human 'h' such that *every* donkey kicked 'h', because no donkey kicked *any* human.\n*   Let's prove it formally:\n    *   Assume, for contradiction, that there *is* a human 'h_0' that every donkey kicked.\n    *   This means $\\forall d (d \\text{ kicked } h_0)$.\n    *   But Rule 1 states $\\forall d \\forall h \\neg (d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n    *   From Rule 1, specifically for 'h_0', we have $\\forall d \\neg (d \\text{ kicked } h_0)$.\n    *   This is a direct contradiction. Therefore, our assumption must be false.\n    *   Thus, there is not a human that every donkey kicked.\n*   **Conclusion: True.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is **6. There is not a human that every donkey kicked.**",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze each statement.\n\n**Understanding the Setup:**\n\n* **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), human (H), or monkey (M).\n* **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n* **Donkey Sightings Rule 1:** Every donkey (d1) saw every donkey (d2) that saw d1. This is a crucial and somewhat tricky rule. Let's rephrase: If donkey A saw donkey B, then donkey B must have seen donkey A. This implies a symmetric \"saw\" relationship *among donkeys*. If A saw B, then B saw A.\n* **Lewis's Sighting:** Lewis (L) saw a donkey.\n* **Conditional Statement:** If Lewis is a donkey (L is D), then (every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel). This means: If L is D, then ( (M_all saw H) => (H_all saw H) ).\n\n**Analyzing Each Statement:**\n\n**1. A donkey saw a donkey.**\n\n*   **Reasoning:** We know there's at least one donkey. Let's call it D1. The rule \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw it\" implies a relationship. If D1 saw D1 (itself), then D1 saw D1. If there are multiple donkeys, say D1 and D2, and D1 saw D2, then D2 saw D1.\n*   Consider the simplest case: only one donkey, D1. Did D1 see D1? The rule \"Every donkey (D1) saw every donkey (D1) that saw it (D1)\" implies that if D1 saw itself, then it saw itself. This doesn't directly *force* a donkey to see another donkey (or itself).\n*   However, the problem states \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\" This is a property of the \"saw\" relationship among donkeys. It doesn't state that any donkey *actually* saw another donkey.\n*   Let's re-evaluate the rule: \"For any donkey $d_1$, and any donkey $d_2$, if $d_2$ saw $d_1$, then $d_1$ saw $d_2$.\" This means the \"saw\" relation among donkeys is symmetric.\n*   Is it possible that no donkey saw any donkey (including itself)? Yes. If the set of \"saw\" relationships among donkeys is empty, the rule still holds vacuously. \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw it\" would be true if no donkey saw any donkey.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**2. No donkeys saw every donkey.**\n\n*   **Reasoning:** This is the negation of \"A donkey saw every donkey.\"\n*   Could it be true? Yes. If there are multiple donkeys, say D1, D2, D3. It's possible D1 saw D2 but not D3, D2 saw D1 but not D3, etc. In this scenario, no single donkey saw *every* donkey.\n*   Could it be false? Yes. If there's only one donkey, D1, and D1 saw itself, then D1 saw \"every donkey\" (which is just D1). Or, if there are multiple donkeys, and one donkey (say D1) saw all other donkeys (D2, D3, ...) and itself, then this statement would be false.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**3. A donkey saw every donkey.**\n\n*   **Reasoning:** This means there exists at least one donkey (let's call it D_x) such that D_x saw every donkey in the set of all donkeys.\n*   Could this be true? Yes. For example, if there's only one donkey, D1, and D1 saw itself. Then D1 saw \"every donkey.\"\n*   Could this be false? Yes. If there are multiple donkeys, and the \"saw\" relationships are sparse, such that no single donkey saw all of them. For example, D1 saw D2, D2 saw D1, but neither saw D3.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**4. Every donkey saw a donkey.**\n\n*   **Reasoning:** This means for every donkey, there is at least one donkey (which could be itself) that it saw.\n*   Could this be true? Yes. If every donkey saw itself, this is true.\n*   Could this be false? Yes. If there's a donkey D1 that saw no donkeys at all (not even itself), then this statement would be false. The rule \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw it\" doesn't *force* any donkey to see another. If D1 saw nothing, then the premise \"every donkey that saw it\" is vacuously true for D1, so the conclusion \"D1 saw them\" is also vacuously true.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**5. Every donkey saw every donkey.**\n\n*   **Reasoning:** This means for every donkey D1, and every donkey D2, D1 saw D2. This implies a complete graph of \"saw\" relationships among donkeys.\n*   Could this be true? Yes. If there's only one donkey, D1, and D1 saw itself. Or if there are multiple donkeys and they all saw each other.\n*   Could this be false? Yes. If there are multiple donkeys, and the \"saw\" relationships are not complete. For example, D1 saw D2, but D1 did not see D3.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**6. A donkey saw every donkey that saw it.**\n\n*   **Reasoning:** This statement is a direct restatement of the given rule about donkeys.\n    *   \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\" (Given)\n    *   \"A donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\" (This means there exists at least one donkey for which this property holds).\n*   Since the rule applies to *every* donkey, it must certainly apply to *at least one* donkey.\n*   **Conclusion:** This must be true because it's a direct consequence of the given information.\n\n**Let's double-check the interpretation of \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\"**\n\nLet $S(x, y)$ mean \"x saw y\".\nThe rule is: $\\forall d_1 \\in D, \\forall d_2 \\in D, (S(d_2, d_1) \\implies S(d_1, d_2))$.\nThis means the \"saw\" relation *among donkeys* is symmetric.\n\nNow let's re-evaluate statement 1: \"A donkey saw a donkey.\"\nIs it possible that no donkey saw any donkey? If $S(d_x, d_y)$ is false for all $d_x, d_y \\in D$, then the premise $S(d_2, d_1)$ is always false, making the implication vacuously true. So, the rule holds even if no donkey saw any donkey.\nTherefore, \"A donkey saw a donkey\" is not necessarily true.\n\nThe information about Lewis and Hazel is a red herring for these statements, as they only concern the \"saw\" relationships among donkeys. The only relevant piece of information is the rule \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\"\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nStatement 6: \"A donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\"\nThis is equivalent to saying: \"There exists a donkey $d_x$ such that for all donkeys $d_y$, if $d_y$ saw $d_x$, then $d_x$ saw $d_y$.\"\nThe original rule states: \"For *every* donkey $d_x$, for all donkeys $d_y$, if $d_y$ saw $d_x$, then $d_x$ saw $d_y$.\"\nIf a property holds for *every* element in a set, it must hold for *at least one* element in that set (given that the set is not empty, which we know it isn't, as there's at least one donkey).\n\nTherefore, statement 6 is a direct logical consequence of the given rule.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).** This means these three categories are exhaustive and mutually exclusive.\n2.  **There's at least one of each.** So, there's at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3.  **Alfred is happy.**\n4.  **No donkeys saw Lewis.**\n5.  **Hazel didn't chase Alfred.**\n6.  **Every monkey saw Alfred.**\n7.  **Every monkey chased Lewis only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.**\n\nLet's focus on statement (7) as it contains a logical contradiction.\n\nLet P be the statement \"Every monkey chased Lewis.\"\nLet Q be the statement \"Not all monkeys chased Lewis.\"\n\nStatement (7) can be written as: P only if Q.\nThis is equivalent to: If P, then Q. (P -> Q)\n\nSo, we have: If (Every monkey chased Lewis), then (Not all monkeys chased Lewis).\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of P and Q:\n*   If P is true, then \"Every monkey chased Lewis\" is true.\n*   If Q is true, then \"Not all monkeys chased Lewis\" is true.\n\nNotice that P and Q are contradictory.\n*   If P is true, then it's impossible for Q to be true (because \"Every monkey chased Lewis\" directly contradicts \"Not all monkeys chased Lewis\").\n*   If Q is true, then it's impossible for P to be true.\n\nSince P and Q are contradictory, the implication \"If P, then Q\" can only be true if P is false.\nWhy?\n*   If P is true, then Q must also be true for the implication (P -> Q) to hold. But we know if P is true, Q must be false. This creates a contradiction (True -> False), which makes the implication false.\n*   Therefore, for the implication (P -> Q) to be true, P must be false. (False -> True or False -> False are both true implications).\n\nSo, from statement (7), we can definitively conclude that **\"Every monkey chased Lewis\" is false.**\nThis means **\"Not all monkeys chased Lewis\" is true.** (This is the negation of \"Every monkey chased Lewis\").\n\nNow let's re-evaluate the given information and the statements to be checked.\n\n**Key Deductions so far:**\n\n*   From (7): **Not all monkeys chased Lewis.** (This means at least one monkey did NOT chase Lewis).\n*   From (6): **Every monkey saw Alfred.**\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n**1. Alfred saw a monkey.**\n*   We know \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" (from 6).\n*   If every monkey saw Alfred, it implies that Alfred was in a position to be seen by monkeys. It doesn't directly state that Alfred *saw* a monkey. However, in typical scenarios of \"seeing,\" if A sees B, B is usually in A's line of sight. If *every* monkey saw Alfred, and there's at least one monkey, it's highly probable that Alfred also saw at least one monkey.\n*   Let's consider if it's possible for \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" to be true, but \"Alfred saw a monkey\" to be false. This would mean Alfred was visible to all monkeys, but Alfred himself didn't perceive any of them. While technically possible (e.g., Alfred is blindfolded but visible, or Alfred is looking the other way), the phrasing \"A saw B\" usually implies mutual presence and potential for mutual observation. However, without further information, we cannot *guarantee* Alfred saw a monkey just because every monkey saw Alfred.\n\n**2. A monkey saw Alfred.**\n*   This is directly stated by premise (6): \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\" If *every* monkey saw Alfred, then it's certainly true that *a* monkey (at least one) saw Alfred.\n*   **This statement must be true.**\n\n**3. Alfred saw every monkey.**\n*   We only know \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" (from 6). This does not imply the reverse. Alfred could have been looking at only one monkey, or none, while still being seen by all of them.\n*   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n**4. Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n*   We know \"Alfred is happy\" (from 3).\n*   We have no information about Lewis's emotional state.\n*   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n**5. Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n*   This directly contradicts premise (6): \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\"\n*   **This statement must be false.**\n\n**6. No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n*   This also directly contradicts premise (6): \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\"\n*   **This statement must be false.**\n\nLet's re-evaluate statement 1.\nIf \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" is true, and we know there is at least one monkey, then there exists at least one monkey, let's call it Monkey A, such that Monkey A saw Alfred.\nDoes this imply Alfred saw Monkey A? Not necessarily. Alfred could be looking away, or be blind, etc. The statement \"A saw B\" does not automatically imply \"B saw A\".\nSo, statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, based on the strict logical deductions:\n\n*   Statement 2 is directly supported by premise (6).\n*   Statements 5 and 6 are directly contradicted by premise (6).\n*   Statements 1, 3, and 4 are not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(Let K be the kicking relation)\n   For every $d_1 \\in D$, there exists $d_2 \\in D$ such that $d_1 K d_2$ and $d_2 K d_1$.\n5. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nLet's analyze statement 4: \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\"\nLet $d$ be an arbitrary donkey. According to this statement, there exists a donkey $d'$ such that $d$ kicked $d'$ AND $d'$ kicked $d$.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\n**1. A donkey kicked every donkey.**\nThis means there exists a donkey $d_x$ such that for every donkey $d_y$, $d_x K d_y$.\nFrom statement 4, for any $d_y$, there exists $d_z$ such that $d_y K d_z$ and $d_z K d_y$. This doesn't directly imply that one specific donkey kicked all others.\nConsider a scenario with two donkeys, $d_1$ and $d_2$.\nIf $d_1 K d_2$ and $d_2 K d_1$, then statement 4 is satisfied for both $d_1$ and $d_2$.\nIn this scenario, \"A donkey kicked every donkey\" would mean either $d_1 K d_1$ and $d_1 K d_2$, OR $d_2 K d_1$ and $d_2 K d_2$.\nStatement 4 only guarantees that for each donkey, there's *some* donkey it kicked that also kicked it back. It doesn't guarantee a universal kicker.\nFor example, if $D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$ and $d_1 K d_2$ and $d_2 K d_1$.\nDoes $d_1$ kick every donkey? No, $d_1$ doesn't kick $d_1$.

(Unless $d_2 K d_2$ is also true, which is not guaranteed).\nThis statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. No donkeys kicked a donkey.**\nThis means for every donkey $d_x$, there is no donkey $d_y$ such that $d_x K d_y$.\nThis directly contradicts statement 4, which says \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\" If every donkey kicked a donkey, then it's not true that no donkeys kicked a donkey.\nSo, this statement must be false.\n\n**3. Every donkey kicked every donkey.**\nThis means for every donkey $d_x$ and every donkey $d_y$, $d_x K d_y$.\nFrom statement 4, for every $d_1 \\in D$, there exists $d_2 \\in D$ such that $d_1 K d_2$ and $d_2 K d_1$.\nIf \"Every donkey kicked every donkey\" is true, then for any $d_1, d_2$, $d_1 K d_2$ and $d_2 K d_1$ would be true, thus satisfying statement 4.\nHowever, statement 4 does not imply this.\nConsider $D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$.\nStatement 4: $d_1$ kicked a donkey that kicked $d_1$. Let's say $d_1 K d_2$ and $d_2 K d_1$.\nAnd $d_2$ kicked a donkey that kicked $d_2$. This is also satisfied by $d_2 K d_1$ and $d_1 K d_2$.\nIn this scenario, \"Every donkey kicked every donkey\" would mean $d_1 K d_1$, $d_1 K d_2$, $d_2 K d_1$, $d_2 K d_2$.\nBut we only know $d_1 K d_2$ and $d_2 K d_1$. We don't know about $d_1 K d_1$ or $d_2 K d_2$.\nSo, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4.

No. Did $d_2$ kick $d_1$? Yes. So $d_1$ is not kicked by every donkey.\nIf $d_x = d_2$: Did $d_1$ kick $d_2$? Yes. Did $d_2$ kick $d_2$? No. So $d_2$ is not kicked by every donkey.\nThis statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. A donkey kicked a donkey.**\nThis means there exists a donkey $d_x$ and a donkey $d_y$ such that $d_x K d_y$.\nStatement 4 says: \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\"\nLet $d_1$ be any donkey (we know there's at least one donkey).\nAccording to statement 4, $d_1$ kicked a donkey $d_2$ (i.e., $d_1 K d_2$).\nThis directly implies that there exists a donkey ($d_1$) that kicked a donkey ($d_2$).\nTherefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**6. No donkeys kicked every donkey.**\nThis means for every donkey $d_x$, there is some donkey $d_y$ such that $d_x$ did not kick $d_y$.\nThis is the negation of \"A donkey kicked every donkey\" (option 1).\nSince option 1 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either.\nConsider $D = \\{d_1\\}$.\nStatement 4: $d_1$ kicked a donkey that kicked $d_1$. This means $d_1 K d_1$.\nIn this case, \"A donkey kicked every donkey\" (option 1) would be true, because $d_1$ kicked $d_1$.\nIf option 1 is true, then option 6 (\"No donkeys kicked every donkey\") would be false.\nSo, option 6 is not necessarily true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on the certainty.\n\nThe only statement that is directly and necessarily implied by \"Every donkey kicked a donkey that kicked it\" is that there is at least one instance of a donkey kicking a donkey.\n\nFinal check:\nStatement 4: $\\forall d_1 \\in D, \\exists d_2 \\in D \\text{ s.t. } d_1 K d_2 \\land d_2 K d_1$.\nSince $D$ is non-empty, let $d_a \\in D$.\nFrom statement 4, there exists $d_b \\in D$ such that $d_a K d_b$ and $d_b K d_a$.\nThe existence of $d_a K d_b$ means that \"A donkey kicked a donkey\" is true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(This is a disjunction: (Only D Drank) OR (Every D Kicked Lewis)).\n\n**Analyzing the Disjunction:**\n\nLet's call the first part of the disjunction P1: \"Only donkeys drank.\"\nLet's call the second part of the disjunction P2: \"Every donkey kicked Lewis.\"\n\nSo, (P1 OR P2) is true.\n\n*   **P1: \"Only donkeys drank.\"** This means:\n    *   If someone drank, they must be a donkey.\n    *   Since we know \"Every donkey drank,\" this implies that all donkeys drank, and no humans or monkeys drank.\n*   **P2: \"Every donkey kicked Lewis.\"** This means:\n    *   All donkeys kicked Lewis.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's consider the implications of the disjunction (P1 OR P2) being true.\n\n**Case 1: P1 is true (\"Only donkeys drank\").**\n*   If P1 is true, then:\n    *   Donkeys drank.\n    *   Humans did not drink.\n    *   Monkeys did not drink.\n\n**Case 2: P2 is true (\"Every donkey kicked Lewis\").**\n*   If P2 is true, then:\n    *   All donkeys kicked Lewis.\n    *   This statement doesn't directly tell us anything about who drank.\n\n**Now let's look at the specific statements we need to evaluate:**\n\n**Statement 1: Alfred didn't drink.**\n*   We know \"A monkey kicked Alfred.\" This tells us Alfred was kicked by a monkey, but not what kind of being Alfred is.\n*   If Alfred is a human or a monkey, then if P1 is true (\"Only donkeys drank\"), Alfred didn't drink.\n*   If Alfred is a donkey, then Alfred drank (because \"Every donkey drank\").\n*   Since we don't know if Alfred is a donkey, a human, or a monkey, we cannot definitively say Alfred didn't drink. For example, if Alfred is a donkey, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred and Hazel drank.**\n*   We know \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" This doesn't tell us if Hazel drank.\n*   We don't know if Alfred drank (as discussed in Statement 1).\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say this is true.\n\n**Statement 3: Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n*   We don't know if Alfred drank.\n*   We don't know if Lewis drank.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say this is true.\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n*   From the given information: \"A monkey is happy.\" (This is directly stated).\n*   From the given information: \"A monkey kicked Alfred.\" (This is directly stated).\n*   Both parts of this conjunction are explicitly stated as true in the problem description.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred drank.**\n*   As discussed in Statement 1, we don't know if Alfred is a donkey, human, or monkey.\n*   If Alfred is a donkey, then Alfred drank.\n*   If Alfred is a human or a monkey, and P1 (\"Only donkeys drank\") is true, then Alfred did not drink.\n*   Since we don't know Alfred's type, we cannot definitively say Alfred drank.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n*   We know \"A monkey kicked Alfred.\" (True).\n*   We know \"A monkey is happy.\" (True).\n*   However, we don't know if Alfred *is* a monkey. If Alfred is a human or a donkey, then Alfred might not be happy (we only know monkeys are happy).\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say Alfred is happy.\n*   Thus, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 4 is directly and necessarily true based on the initial premises.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

Alfred will run.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\nFrom statement 2: **\"every human chased Alfred.\"**\n\nThis directly implies:\n*   There is at least one human (since there's at least one of each category).\n*   That human chased Alfred.\n\nTherefore, **\"A human chased Alfred\"** must be true.

This is not necessarily true.\n*   **2. Alfred chased a human.** Same as above, not necessarily true.\n*   **3. No humans chased Alfred.** This directly contradicts \"every human chased Alfred.\" So, this is false.\n*   **4. A human chased Alfred.** This is directly implied by \"every human chased Alfred.\" This must be true.\n*   **5. Not all humans chased Alfred.** This directly contradicts \"every human chased Alfred.\" So, this is false.\n*   **6. Alfred will run.** We have no information about Alfred's ability or willingness to run. The only mention of \"run\" is in relation to Lewis.

(HH <=> NDA)\n*   No donkeys will attack (NDA) just in case a human is asleep (HAS). (NDA <=> HAS)\n\n**Analysis of the Core Logic:**\n\nFrom the last two points:\n1.  HH <=> NDA\n2.  NDA <=> HAS\n\nCombining these, we get:\nHH <=> NDA <=> HAS\n\nThis means: **A human is happy if and only if a human is asleep.**\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's consider each statement:\n\n**1. Alfred and Lewis will attack.**\n*   We know Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n*   We have no information linking being asleep to attacking, or their species to attacking.\n*   We don't even know if Alfred and Lewis are humans, donkeys, or monkeys.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**2. A human is happy just in case a human is asleep.**\n*   As derived above (HH <=> NDA and NDA <=> HAS implies HH <=> HAS), this statement directly follows from the given premises.\n*   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\n**3. A human is happy just in case every human is asleep.**\n*   We know \"A human is happy just in case *a* human is asleep.\" (HH <=> HAS).\n*   This is different from \"every human is asleep.\"\n*   For example, if there are multiple humans, and only one is asleep, then \"a human is asleep\" is true. If \"every human is asleep\" were required for happiness, then the human wouldn't be happy. But our derived rule says they would be happy.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**4. Alfred will attack.**\n*   Similar to statement 1, we have no information to support this. We don't know Alfred's species or any rules about attacking.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**5. Alfred won't attack.**\n*   Similar to statement 1, we have no information to support this. We don't know Alfred's species or any rules about attacking.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**6. A human is happy just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n*   This is the opposite of \"A human is happy just in case every human is asleep.\"\n*   We know \"A human is happy just in case *a* human is asleep.\"\n*   This statement contradicts our derived truth. If a human is happy, then a human is asleep. If \"not all humans are asleep\" were the condition, it would mean that if all humans were asleep, a human would *not* be happy, which contradicts our derived rule (if all humans are asleep, then *a* human is asleep, so a human is happy).\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is statement 2.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

But we know no humans attack. So, this statement would only be true if *no one* attacks at all. We don't have enough information to confirm that no one (donkeys or monkeys) will attack.\n    *   For example, a monkey might attack.

This means: $\\exists d \\in D \\text{ such that } d \\text{ did not see Hazel}$.\n4.  **Humans & Alfred:** Every human (H) chased Alfred (H_chased_Alfred). This means: $\\forall h \\in H, h \\text{ chased Alfred}$.\n5.  **Donkeys & Lewis (Conditional 1):** Every donkey (D) chased Lewis (D_chased_Lewis) if and only if a human (H) saw Hazel (H_saw_Hazel).\n    *   Let P = \"Every donkey chased Lewis\" ($\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ chased Lewis}$)\n    *   Let Q = \"A human saw Hazel\" ($\\exists h \\in H \\text{ such that } h \\text{ saw Hazel}$)\n    *   So, P $\\iff$ Q.\n6.  **Donkeys & Lewis (Conditional 2):** Every donkey (D) chased Lewis (D_chased_Lewis) just in case Lewis saw Hazel (Lewis_saw_Hazel).\n    *   Let P = \"Every donkey chased Lewis\" ($\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ chased Lewis}$)\n    *   Let R = \"Lewis saw Hazel\"\n    *   So, P $\\iff$ R.\n\n**Deductions from Given Information:**\n\nFrom (5) and (6), we have:\nP $\\iff$ Q\nP $\\iff$ R\n\nThis implies Q $\\iff$ R.\nTherefore, **\"A human saw Hazel\" if and only if \"Lewis saw Hazel\"**.\n\nLet's re-evaluate statement (3): \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\". This is given directly in point (3) of the problem description.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\n**Option 1: Lewis saw Lewis just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n*   \"Lewis saw Lewis\" is a tautology (always true).\n*   So, this statement becomes: True $\\iff$ \"A human saw Hazel\".\n*   This means \"A human saw Hazel\" must be true.\n*   However, we don't know if \"A human saw Hazel\" is true or false. It depends on the specific scenario.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 2: A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n*   \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is a tautology (always true).\n*   So, this statement becomes: \"A human saw Lewis\" and True.\n*   This means \"A human saw Lewis\" must be true.\n*   We have no information about whether any human saw Lewis.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 3: Not all humans saw Hazel if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.**\n*   Let S = \"Not all humans saw Hazel\" ($\\exists h \\in H \\text{ such that } h \\text{ did not see Hazel}$)\n*   Let R = \"Lewis saw Hazel\"\n*   The statement is S $\\iff$ R.\n*   We know Q $\\iff$ R (A human saw Hazel $\\iff$ Lewis saw Hazel).\n*   If Q is true (A human saw Hazel), then R is true. In this case, S (Not all humans saw Hazel) could be true or false. For example, if one human saw Hazel, but another didn't, then Q is true and S is true. If all humans saw Hazel, then Q is true and S is false. So S $\\iff$ R is not necessarily true.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 4: A human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel.**\n*   Let Q = \"A human saw Hazel\"\n*   Let R = \"Lewis saw Hazel\"\n*   The statement is Q $\\iff$ R.\n*   As deduced earlier from given information (5) and (6), Q $\\iff$ R **must be true**.\n\n**Option 5: A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n*   \"It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" is \"False\" (since \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is a tautology).\n*   So, this statement becomes: \"A human saw Lewis\" and False.\n*   This entire conjunction is always False.\n*   Since it's not always true, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 6: Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.**\n*   \"Lewis saw Lewis\" is a tautology (always true).\n*   So, this statement becomes: True $\\iff$ \"Not all humans saw Hazel\".\n*   This means \"Not all humans saw Hazel\" must be true.\n*   We have no information that forces \"Not all humans saw Hazel\" to be true. It's possible that all humans saw Hazel.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the deductions, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

If there are 'n' donkeys, say D1, D2, ..., Dn, then D1 saw D1, D1 saw D2, ..., D1 saw Dn, and D2 saw D1, D2 saw D2, ..., D2 saw Dn, and so on.

No.** (In fact, it must be false).\n\n3.  **There is not a donkey that every donkey saw.**\n    *   We are told, \"Every donkey saw every donkey.\" This means if we pick *any* donkey (let's call it D_x), then *every* other donkey (and D_x itself) saw D_x. For example, if there are D1, D2, D3, then D1 saw D1, D2 saw D1, and D3 saw D1. So, D1 is a donkey that every donkey saw.

Yes.**\n\n5.  **No donkeys saw every donkey.**\n    *   This is the direct opposite of statement 4. Since statement 4 must be true, this statement must be false.\n    *   **Must be true?

(This seems like a distractor, as \"asleep\" isn't related to the other predicates).\n*   **Hazel & Alfred:** Hazel chased Alfred.\n*   **Donkeys & Hazel:** Not all donkeys chased Hazel. (This means there's at least one donkey that *didn't* chase Hazel).\n*   **Donkeys & Humans & Kicking:** Every donkey kicked every human that kicked it.\n*   **Alfred & Hazel (Conditional):** Alfred didn't chase Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel. This means:\n    *   If Alfred didn't chase Hazel, then every human chased Hazel.\n    *   If every human chased Hazel, then Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n\n**Analyzing the Kicking Rule:**\n\n\"Every donkey kicked every human that kicked it.\"\n\nLet's represent this formally:\nFor any individual `d` that is a donkey (d \u2208 D), and any individual `h` that is a human (h \u2208 H):\nIf `h` kicked `d` (Kicked(h, d)), then `d` kicked `h` (Kicked(d, h)).\n\nThis rule describes a specific relationship: if a human kicks a donkey, that donkey *must* retaliate by kicking that human. It does *not* say anything about donkeys kicking humans who *didn't* kick them, nor does it say anything about donkeys kicking *all* humans.\n\n**Evaluating Each Statement:**\n\n1.  **A donkey kicked every human that kicked it.**\n    *   This statement is a direct rephrasing of the given rule, but it uses \"A donkey\" instead of \"Every donkey\".\n    *   The given rule is \"Every donkey kicked every human that kicked it.\"\n    *   If *every* donkey has this property, then it must be true that *a* (at least one) donkey has this property.\n    *   **Must be true.**\n\n2.  **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n    *   The given rule states: If H kicked D, then D kicked H.\n    *   It does *not* state that D kicked H if H *didn't* kick D.\n    *   It's possible there are humans who didn't kick any donkeys. In that case, the rule doesn't require any donkey to kick them.\n    *   Consider a scenario: Donkey D1, Human H1, Human H2. H1 kicked D1. H2 did not kick D1.\n        *   Rule implies: D1 kicked H1.\n        *   Rule does *not* imply: D1 kicked H2.\n    *   Therefore, it's not necessarily true that every donkey kicked *every* human.\n    *   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n3.  **A donkey kicked every human.**\n    *   This is a weaker version of statement 2. It says there exists at least one donkey that kicked *all* humans.\n    *   Again, the rule only applies to humans who *kicked* a donkey. It doesn't guarantee that any single donkey kicked *all* humans, especially if some humans didn't kick any donkeys.\n    *   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n4.  **A donkey kicked a human.**\n    *   We know there's at least one donkey and at least one human.\n    *   The rule states: \"Every donkey kicked every human that kicked it.\"\n    *   For this statement to be true, there must be at least one instance where a human kicked a donkey. If no human ever kicked any donkey, then the antecedent \"human that kicked it\" would never be met, and the rule wouldn't force any donkey to kick any human.\n    *   The problem doesn't state that any human *did* kick a donkey. It only states what *would happen if* they did.\n    *   Consider a scenario: D1, H1. H1 did not kick D1. The rule is vacuously true (no human kicked D1, so D1 doesn't have to kick anyone based on this rule). In this scenario, \"A donkey kicked a human\" is false.\n    *   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n5.  **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 3 (\"A donkey kicked every human\").\n    *   Since statement 3 is \"Not necessarily true\" (meaning it *could* be true or false), its negation is also \"Not necessarily true\" (meaning it *could* be true or false).\n    *   If it's possible for \"A donkey kicked every human\" to be true (e.g., if every human kicked a specific donkey, and that donkey then kicked every human), then \"No donkeys kicked every human\" would be false.\n    *   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n6.  **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n    *   This means for every donkey, there is at least one human that it kicked.\n    *   Similar to statement 4, this depends on whether any humans kicked any donkeys.\n    *   If no human ever kicked any donkey, then no donkey would be required by the rule to kick any human. In that case, this statement would be false.\n    *   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Revisiting the \"Alfred didn't chase Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel\" clause:**\n\n*   This clause establishes a biconditional relationship: (Alfred didn't chase Hazel) <=> (Every human chased Hazel).\n*   We are also given \"Hazel chased Alfred.\"\n*   This means Alfred *was* chased by Hazel.\n*   Does this tell us anything about Alfred *chasing* Hazel? No.\n*   Does this tell us anything about humans chasing Hazel? No.\n*   This clause, along with \"Hazel chased Alfred\" and \"Not all donkeys chased Hazel,\" seems to be a distractor for the kicking rules. It doesn't provide any information that forces any human to kick any donkey, or vice-versa.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is the one that directly reflects the given rule about kicking, specifically statement 1. The other statements make stronger claims about the extent of kicking (e.g., kicking *all* humans, or kicking *any* human) that are not supported by the conditional nature of the given kicking rule. The rule only guarantees a kick *back* if a kick *first* occurred.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

Not necessarily.

Hazel is a donkey.** (False, based on Conclusion 1)\n*   **2. Alfred isn't a donkey.** (We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this yet.)\n*   **3.

Lewis isn't a donkey.** (We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this yet.)\n*   **6. Lewis is a donkey.** (We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this yet.)\n\nSince we have definitively proven that \"Hazel isn't a donkey\" must be true, this is our answer.

(This means if someone is hungry, they are human. If someone is not human, they are not hungry.)\n5.  **Hazel's Action (Humans):** Hazel kicked every human.\n6.  **Donkeys & Hazel:** No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n7.  **Hazel & Alfred:** Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n8.  **Monkeys, Lewis, Humans, Hazel (Conditional):** Not all monkeys chased Lewis ONLY IF not all humans kicked Hazel.\n\n**Analysis of Key Information:**\n\n*   **From (4) \"Only humans are hungry\":**\n    *   If X is hungry, then X is a human.\n    *   If X is not a human, then X is not hungry.\n    *   Since there's at least one human, there *can* be hungry individuals.\n    *   Donkeys are not hungry. Monkeys are not hungry.\n\n*   **From (5) \"Hazel kicked every human\":**\n    *   This implies that if X is a human, then Hazel kicked X.\n    *   Since there's at least one human, Hazel kicked at least one individual.\n\n*   **From (8) \"Not all monkeys chased Lewis ONLY IF not all humans kicked Hazel\":**\n    *   This is a statement of the form P ONLY IF Q, which is equivalent to P -> Q.\n    *   Let P = \"Not all monkeys chased Lewis\".\n    *   Let Q = \"Not all humans kicked Hazel\".\n    *   So, (Not all monkeys chased Lewis) -> (Not all humans kicked Hazel).\n\n*   **Contradiction with (5):** We know from (5) that \"Hazel kicked every human.\" This means it is *not* true that \"Not all humans kicked Hazel.\" In other words, \"All humans kicked Hazel\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, the consequent Q (\"Not all humans kicked Hazel\") is **false**.\n\n*   **Implication from (P -> Q) where Q is false:** If P -> Q is true and Q is false, then P must be false.\n    *   So, P (\"Not all monkeys chased Lewis\") must be **false**.\n    *   If \"Not all monkeys chased Lewis\" is false, then its negation is true: \"All monkeys chased Lewis\" is true.\n\n**Summary of Deductions:**\n\n*   Only humans are hungry.\n*   Hazel kicked every human.\n*   No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n*   All monkeys chased Lewis.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.**\n\n*   **Part 1: \"If Hazel is hungry\"**\n    *   From \"Only humans are hungry\", if Hazel is hungry, then Hazel is a human.\n*   **Part 2: \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\"**\n    *   We know \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" (from given info 6). This means it's true that \"Not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" (in fact, zero donkeys kicked Hazel). So this part is **TRUE**.\n*   **Part 3: \"no humans are hungry\"**\n    *   We know \"Only humans are hungry\". Since there's at least one human, it's possible for humans to be hungry. If there's at least one human, and humans *can* be hungry, then \"no humans are hungry\" is not necessarily true. It's only true if there are no humans, which contradicts the given information that there's at least one of each. So, \"no humans are hungry\" is **FALSE** (because there are humans, and humans *can* be hungry, meaning at least one human *could* be hungry).\n*   **Conditional in the consequent: (Part 2) ONLY IF (Part 3)**\n    *   (TRUE) ONLY IF (FALSE) is equivalent to (TRUE) -> (FALSE), which is **FALSE**.\n*   **Overall Statement:** (If Hazel is hungry) -> (FALSE)\n    *   If Hazel is human (and thus can be hungry), then the statement becomes (TRUE) -> (FALSE), which is FALSE.\n    *   If Hazel is not human (and thus not hungry), then the antecedent \"Hazel is hungry\" is false, making the whole implication true.\n    *   We don't know if Hazel is human or not.\n    *   However, the statement \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry\" is (TRUE) ONLY IF (FALSE), which is FALSE. So the consequent of the main conditional is FALSE.\n    *   Therefore, for the whole statement to be true, the antecedent \"Hazel is hungry\" must be false.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the consequent: \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is TRUE. \"no humans are hungry\" is FALSE (since there are humans, and humans *can* be hungry). So (TRUE) ONLY IF (FALSE) is FALSE.\n    *   So the statement is \"If Hazel is hungry, then FALSE\". This statement is only true if \"Hazel is hungry\" is false. We don't know if Hazel is hungry.\n    *   **Let's re-evaluate the \"no humans are hungry\" part.** \"Only humans are hungry\" means that if someone is hungry, they are human. It does *not* mean that all humans *are* hungry. It also does not mean that *no* humans are hungry. Since there is at least one human, it is possible for at least one human to be hungry. Therefore, \"no humans are hungry\" is **not necessarily true**. In fact, given that there are humans and humans *can* be hungry, it's likely false unless specified otherwise.\n    *   Let's assume \"no humans are hungry\" is false because there *are* humans and they *can* be hungry.\n    *   Then the consequent \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry\" is (TRUE) ONLY IF (FALSE), which is FALSE.\n    *   So the statement becomes \"If Hazel is hungry, then FALSE\". This statement is only true if Hazel is not hungry. We cannot definitively say this must be true.\n    *   **Conclusion for 1:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**2. Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n\n*   From \"Only humans are hungry\", if Alfred is hungry, Alfred is human. If Lewis is hungry, Lewis is human.\n*   We don't know if Alfred or Lewis are human.\n*   We know Lewis didn't kick Lewis. This doesn't tell us his species.\n*   We know Hazel didn't chase Alfred. This doesn't tell us his species.\n*   Since we don't know their species, we cannot conclude they are hungry.\n*   **Conclusion for 2:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**3. If Hazel kicked Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.**\n\n*   **Part 1: \"If Hazel kicked Hazel\"**\n    *   If Hazel kicked Hazel, then Hazel must be a human (because Hazel kicked every human, so if Hazel kicked herself, she must be one of the humans she kicked).\n*   **Part 2: \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\"**\n    *   We know \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" (from given info 6). This means it's true that \"Not all donkeys kicked Hazel\". So this part is **TRUE**.\n*   **Part 3: \"no humans are hungry\"**\n    *   As discussed in statement 1, \"no humans are hungry\" is **FALSE** (because there are humans, and humans *can* be hungry).\n*   **Conditional in the consequent: (Part 2) ONLY IF (Part 3)**\n    *   (TRUE) ONLY IF (FALSE) is equivalent to (TRUE) -> (FALSE), which is **FALSE**.\n*   **Overall Statement:** (If Hazel kicked Hazel) -> (FALSE)\n    *   If Hazel kicked Hazel, then Hazel is human. If Hazel is human, then the antecedent is true. Then the statement becomes (TRUE) -> (FALSE), which is FALSE.\n    *   If Hazel is not human, then Hazel didn't kick Hazel (because Hazel only kicked humans). In this case, the antecedent \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" is false, making the whole implication true.\n    *   We don't know if Hazel is human or not.\n    *   However, the consequent \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry\" is definitively FALSE.\n    *   Therefore, for the entire statement to be true, the antecedent \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" must be false.\n    *   If Hazel is a human, then Hazel kicked Hazel (because Hazel kicked every human). In this case, the statement is (TRUE) -> (FALSE), which is FALSE.\n    *   If Hazel is a donkey or a monkey, then Hazel did not kick Hazel (because Hazel only kicked humans). In this case, the statement is (FALSE) -> (FALSE), which is TRUE.\n    *   Since we don't know Hazel's species, we cannot definitively say this must be true.\n    *   **Conclusion for 3:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**4. Alfred is hungry.**\n\n*   From \"Only humans are hungry\", if Alfred is hungry, then Alfred is human.\n*   We have no information to determine if Alfred is human or not.\n*   **Conclusion for 4:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**5. Only humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n\n*   **Part 1: \"Only humans are hungry\"**\n    *   This is directly given information (4). So this part is **TRUE**.\n*   **Part 2: \"no donkeys kicked Hazel\"**\n    *   This is directly given information (6). So this part is **TRUE**.\n*   **Overall Statement:** (TRUE) AND (TRUE) is **TRUE**.\n*   **Conclusion for 5:** Must be true.\n\n**6. Not all humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n\n*   **Part 1: \"Not all humans are hungry\"**\n    *   \"Only humans are hungry\" means that if someone is hungry, they are human. It does *not* mean that all humans *are* hungry. It is entirely possible that some humans are hungry and some are not, or even that no humans are hungry (though this contradicts the existence of humans who *can* be hungry).\n    *   However, the statement \"Not all humans are hungry\" means that it's not the case that *all* humans are hungry. This is consistent with \"Only humans are hungry\" and the existence of humans. It doesn't mean *no* humans are hungry, just that the set of hungry people isn't necessarily the entire set of humans.\n    *   Since there are humans, and only humans can be hungry, it's possible that some humans are hungry and some are not. It's also possible that",

If a monkey saw Alfred, then every monkey saw Lewis (\u2203m \u2208 M, m_saw_A) \u2192 (\u2200m \u2208 M, m_saw_L).\n6.  If a human chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if every monkey saw Hazel (\u2203h \u2208 H, h_chased_Hz) \u2192 (L=D \u2192 (\u2200m \u2208 M, m_saw_Hz)).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" (\u2200m \u2208 M, m_saw_A).\nThis implies that \"A monkey saw Alfred\" (\u2203m \u2208 M, m_saw_A) is true.\n\nNow, let's use statement 5:\n(\u2203m \u2208 M, m_saw_A) \u2192 (\u2200m \u2208 M, m_saw_L)\n\nSince we established that (\u2203m \u2208 M, m_saw_A) is true, the consequent must also be true.\nTherefore, (\u2200m \u2208 M, m_saw_L) is true.\n\nThis means \"Every monkey saw Lewis\" is true.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.** This statement is about kicking, not seeing.

(Let's call this human 'C'. So, for every H, H chased C).\n4.  **Donkey Happiness/Running (Conditional 1):** Every donkey is happy (DH) OR not all donkeys will run (NDR). (DH $\\lor$ NDR)\n5.  **Hazel & Alfred (Human Status):** If Hazel is a human (H), then Alfred isn't a human (not H). (H(Hazel) $\\implies$ not H(Alfred))\n6.  **Lewis & Donkeys Running:** Lewis ate AND every donkey will run (DR).

Alfred will run.**\n    *   We know \"Every donkey will run.\"\n    *   We don't know if Alfred is a donkey. We only know Alfred isn't a human if Hazel is a human. We don't know Alfred's species for sure.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot conclude Alfred will run.\n\n**2.

Every donkey is happy.**\n    *   As derived above, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**4. Not all donkeys are happy.**\n    *   We concluded that \"Every donkey is happy.\"\n    *   This statement contradicts our conclusion.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**5. Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n    *   We concluded that \"Every donkey will run.\"\n    *   If \"Every donkey will run\" is true, then \"Not all donkeys will run\" is false.\n    *   This statement is of the form (False AND True), which is False.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**6.

Let's denote \"A saw B\" as S(A, B). The rule means: For any human x, and any human y, if S(y, x) (y saw x), then S(x, y) (x saw y). This implies a symmetry in the \"saw\" relationship *among humans, specifically for those who were seen*. If I saw you, and you're a human, then you saw me.\n*   **Monkey-Human Interaction:** \"A monkey kicked a human that kicked a human.\" This confirms the existence of at least one monkey and at least two humans (one who was kicked, and one who was kicked by the first human).\n*   **Alfred & Lewis:** \"Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis is a donkey.\" This information is largely irrelevant to the \"seeing\" relationships among humans, but it confirms the existence of a donkey (Lewis).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet H be the set of all humans.\n\n1.  **A human saw every human that saw it.**\n    *   This statement is *identical* to the given rule: \"Every human saw every human that saw it.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n2.  **Every human saw every human.**\n    *   This means for any two humans x and y (x can be y), S(x, y) is true.\n    *   The given rule states: if S(y, x), then S(x, y). It *does not* state that S(x, y) is true for all x, y in H.\n    *   Consider a scenario with two humans, H1 and H2.\n        *   If H1 saw H2, then H2 saw H1.\n        *   If H2 saw H1, then H1 saw H2.\n        *   But it's possible that *neither* H1 saw H2 *nor* H2 saw H1. The rule doesn't force them to see each other.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **is not necessarily true**.\n\n3.  **A human saw a human.**\n    *   We know there's at least one human (from the \"at least one of each\" rule and the \"monkey kicked a human that kicked a human\" rule, which implies at least two humans).\n    *   Let's consider the simplest case: one human, H1. Did H1 see H1? The rule \"Every human saw every human that saw it\" applies. If H1 saw H1 (S(H1, H1)), then H1 saw H1 (S(H1, H1)). This doesn't force H1 to see H1.\n    *   However, the problem states \"A monkey kicked a human that kicked a human.\" Let's call the first human H_A and the second human H_B. So, a monkey kicked H_A, and H_A kicked H_B. This confirms H_A and H_B exist and are humans.\n    *   Does H_A see H_B, or H_B see H_A, or H_A see H_A, or H_B see H_B? The rule only states a conditional: *if* someone saw someone, then the seen person saw the seer. It doesn't guarantee any seeing actually happened.\n    *   It is possible that no human ever saw any other human, or even themselves. The rule \"Every human saw every human that saw it\" would still hold vacuously if no human ever saw any human.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **is not necessarily true**.\n\n4.  **Every human saw a human.**\n    *   This means for every human x, there exists at least one human y (possibly x itself) such that S(x, y).\n    *   Similar to statement 3, the given rule doesn't force any human to see any other human. If no human saw any human, this statement would be false, but the given rule would still be true (vacuously).\n    *   Therefore, this statement **is not necessarily true**.\n\n5.  **A human saw every human.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one human x such that for every human y (including x itself), S(x, y).\n    *   This is a very strong claim. The given rule does not support this. It's possible that no human saw any human, or that humans only saw a subset of other humans.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **is not necessarily true**.\n\n6.  **No humans saw every human.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 5. If statement 5 is \"A human saw every human,\" then statement 6 is \"It is not the case that a human saw every human.\"\n    *   Since statement 5 is not necessarily true, its negation (statement 6) is not necessarily true either. It's possible that a human *did* see every human (e.g., if there's only one human, and they saw themselves, or if there are multiple humans and one of them happened to see all of them).\n    *   Therefore, this statement **is not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 1 is a direct restatement of a given premise.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

(Let's call this statement P: \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\")\n4.  **Alfred & Drinking:** Alfred drank unless Alfred isn't a human. This is equivalent to: \"If Alfred isn't a human, then Alfred didn't drink.\" The contrapositive is: \"If Alfred drank, then Alfred is a human.\" The original statement can also be interpreted as: \"Alfred drank if and only if Alfred is a human.\" Let's assume the \"unless\" means \"if not\". So, \"Alfred drank if and only if Alfred is a human.\"\n5.  **Donkeys & Alfred (Conditional):** \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n    *   Let Q be \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n    *   Let R be \"No donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n    *   The statement is \"Q just in case R,\" which means \"Q if and only if R.\" So, (Q <=> R).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet's focus on statement 5 first: (Q <=> R).\n*   Q: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\" This means there is at least one donkey that *did not* chase Alfred.\n*   R: \"No donkeys chased Alfred.\" This means *all* donkeys did not chase Alfred.\n\nIf R is true (\"No donkeys chased Alfred\"), then Q must also be true (\"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\"). This is consistent, as \"no donkeys\" implies \"not all donkeys.\"\n\nIf Q is true (\"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\"), then R must also be true (\"No donkeys chased Alfred\"). This is the crucial part. If there's at least one donkey that didn't chase Alfred, and this implies *no* donkeys chased Alfred, then it means that if even one donkey didn't chase Alfred, then *all* donkeys must not have chased Alfred. This implies that the only way for \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" to be true is if \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is true.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 3: \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\" (P)\n\nConsider the relationship between P, Q, and R:\n*   P: \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\"\n*   Q: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\" (This is the negation of P, assuming there's at least one donkey. If there are no donkeys, P is vacuously true, and Q is false. But we know there's at least one donkey.) So, Q is equivalent to \"P is false.\"\n*   R: \"No donkeys chased Alfred.\" (This is a stronger statement than Q).\n\nFrom (Q <=> R):\nIf Q is true, then R is true.\nIf Q is false, then R is false.\n\nLet's consider the truth value of P:\n*   **Case 1: P is true.** (\"Every donkey chased Alfred.\")\n    *   If P is true, then Q (\"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\") is false.\n    *   Since Q is false, from (Q <=> R), R (\"No donkeys chased Alfred\") must also be false. This is consistent, as \"every donkey chased Alfred\" means \"it's not true that no donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n    *   So, if P is true, everything is consistent so far.\n\n*   **Case 2: P is false.** (\"Not every donkey chased Alfred.\")\n    *   If P is false, then Q (\"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\") is true.\n    *   Since Q is true, from (Q <=> R), R (\"No donkeys chased Alfred\") must also be true.\n    *   So, if P is false, then R (\"No donkeys chased Alfred\") must be true. This means that if it's not true that *every* donkey chased Alfred, then it must be true that *no* donkeys chased Alfred. This is a very strong implication.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate statement 3: \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\" This is given as a premise.\nSo, P is true.\n\nIf P (\"Every donkey chased Alfred\") is true, then:\n*   Q (\"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\") is false.\n*   Since Q is false, from (Q <=> R), R (\"No donkeys chased Alfred\") must be false. This is consistent with P being true.\n\nSo, based on the premises, \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" is true.\n\nNow let's evaluate the numbered statements:\n\n**1. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n*   This is Q. We determined that P (\"Every donkey chased Alfred\") is true. Therefore, Q is false.\n*   **Must be false.**\n\n**2. Alfred chased every donkey.**\n*   The premises state \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\" This is about donkeys chasing Alfred, not Alfred chasing donkeys. We have no information about Alfred chasing donkeys.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**3. A donkey chased Alfred.**\n*   We know \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" (P is true).\n*   We also know there's at least one donkey.\n*   If every donkey chased Alfred, and there's at least one donkey, then it logically follows that at least one donkey chased Alfred.\n*   **Must be true.**\n\n**4. No donkeys chased Alfred.**\n*   This is R. We determined that P (\"Every donkey chased Alfred\") is true, which means R is false.\n*   **Must be false.**\n\n**5. Alfred chased a donkey.**\n*   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about Alfred chasing donkeys.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**6. Alfred drank.**\n*   We know: \"Alfred drank unless Alfred isn't a human.\" This means \"Alfred drank if and only if Alfred is a human.\"\n*   We are told that there is at least one human.\n*   However, we don't know if Alfred *is* a human. Alfred could be a donkey or a monkey.\n*   If Alfred is a human, then Alfred drank.\n*   If Alfred is a donkey or a monkey, then Alfred didn't drink.\n*   Since we don't know Alfred's category, we cannot determine if Alfred drank.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\nLet's double-check the interpretation of \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\"\nThis is (Q <=> R).\nWe are given \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\" This is P.\nSince there is at least one donkey, P implies not Q. (If P is true, Q is false).\nIf Q is false, then from (Q <=> R), R must be false.\nSo, \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" (P is true) and \"No donkeys chased Alfred\" (R is false) are consistent.\nAnd \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" (Q is false) is consistent with \"No donkeys chased Alfred\" (R is false).\n\nTherefore, the initial premise \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" holds true.\n\nBased on this:\n1. Not all donkeys chased Alfred. (False, because every donkey chased Alfred)\n2. Alfred chased every donkey. (Unknown)\n3. A donkey chased Alfred. (True, because every donkey chased Alfred and there's at least one donkey)\n4. No donkeys chased Alfred. (False, because every donkey chased Alfred)\n5. Alfred chased a donkey. (Unknown)\n6. Alfred drank. (Unknown, depends on whether Alfred is a human)\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is statement 3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

We have no information about *all* other donkeys. This statement is not necessarily true.\n2.  **Hazel saw every donkey.** We know Lewis saw Hazel, but we don't know if Hazel saw Lewis, or any other donkey for that matter. This statement is not necessarily true.\n3.  **A donkey saw Hazel.** Yes, we deduced that Lewis is a donkey and Lewis sees Hazel. Therefore, a donkey (specifically Lewis) saw Hazel. This statement **must be true**.\n4.  **No donkeys saw Hazel.** This contradicts our deduction that Lewis (a donkey) saw Hazel. This statement **must be false**.\n5.  **Hazel saw a donkey.** We know Lewis is a donkey and Lewis sees Hazel. However, this doesn't mean Hazel saw Lewis. The action of seeing is directional. Lewis sees Hazel, but Hazel might not see Lewis. This statement is not necessarily true.\n6.  **Not all donkeys saw Hazel.** We know Lewis saw Hazel. If there are other donkeys who did not see Hazel, then this statement would be true. If Lewis is the *only* donkey, or if all donkeys saw Hazel, then this statement would be false.

(LCL -> NDH)\n*   **P4:** A human is asleep (HAS) just in case every human chased Hazel (EHCH). (HAS <-> EHCH)\n*   **P5:** Every monkey chased Hazel (EMCH) just in case every human chased Hazel (EHCH). (EMCH <-> EHCH)\n\n**Analyzing the Given Information:**\n\nFrom P4 and P5, we can establish a direct relationship between HAS, EHCH, and EMCH:\n\n*   HAS <-> EHCH (from P4)\n*   EMCH <-> EHCH (from P5)\n\nSince both HAS and EMCH are logically equivalent to EHCH, they must also be logically equivalent to each other.\nTherefore, **HAS <-> EMCH** must be true.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement.\n\n**Statement 1: A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n*   This translates to: HAS <-> EMCH\n*   As derived above, this must be true based on P4 and P5.\n\n**Statement 2: If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n*   This translates to: ~ (All humans are asleep) -> (EMCH -> ~HCH)\n*   Let's rephrase \"not all humans are asleep\" as \"at least one human is not asleep\" or \"~(HAS)\".\n*   So, ~HAS -> (EMCH -> ~HCH)\n*   We know HAS <-> EMCH.\n*   If HAS is false (~HAS), then EMCH must also be false (~EMCH).\n*   So, the premise ~HAS implies ~EMCH.\n*   If ~EMCH is true, then the consequent (EMCH -> ~HCH) becomes (False -> ~HCH), which is always true.\n*   Therefore, if ~HAS is true, the entire statement is true.\n*   This statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 3: If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.**\n*   This translates to: ~ (All humans are asleep) -> (~HCH -> All monkeys are asleep)\n*   Let's rephrase \"not all humans are asleep\" as \"~HAS\".\n*   So, ~HAS -> (~HCH -> All monkeys are asleep)\n*   As in Statement 2, if ~HAS is true, then ~EMCH is true.\n*   The statement is ~HAS -> (~HCH -> All monkeys are asleep).\n*   This statement does not necessarily have to be true. Consider a scenario where ~HAS is true (so ~EMCH is true), ~HCH is true, but not all monkeys are asleep. This would make the consequent false, and thus the entire conditional false. We have no information to guarantee \"All monkeys are asleep\" from ~EMCH or ~HCH.\n\n**Statement 4: Not all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.**\n*   This translates to: ~ (All humans are asleep) <-> EMCH\n*   Let's rephrase \"not all humans are asleep\" as \"~HAS\".\n*   So, ~HAS <-> EMCH\n*   We know HAS <-> EMCH.\n*   If HAS is true, then EMCH is true.\n*   If HAS is false (~HAS), then EMCH is false (~EMCH).\n*   The statement says ~HAS <-> EMCH.\n*   If HAS is true, then ~HAS is false. The statement becomes False <-> EMCH. Since EMCH is true, this is False <-> True, which is False.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true. It is false if HAS is true.\n\n**Statement 5: Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n*   This translates to: (All humans are asleep) <-> EMCH\n*   Let's rephrase \"All humans are asleep\" as \"HAS\".\n*   So, HAS <-> EMCH\n*   As derived from P4 and P5, this must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n*   This translates to: (All humans are asleep) -> (EMCH -> ~HCH)\n*   Let's rephrase \"All humans are asleep\" as \"HAS\".\n*   So, HAS -> (EMCH -> ~HCH)\n*   We know HAS <-> EMCH.\n*   If HAS is true, then EMCH is true.\n*   So, the premise HAS implies EMCH.\n*   If HAS is true, the statement becomes True -> (True -> ~HCH), which simplifies to True -> ~HCH, or simply ~HCH.\n*   We have no information to guarantee ~HCH. Hazel could have chased Hazel.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Summary of Must-Be-True Statements:**\n\n*   Statement 1: A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel. (HAS <-> EMCH) - **TRUE**\n*   Statement 2: If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel. (~HAS -> (EMCH -> ~HCH)) - **TRUE**\n*   Statement 5: Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel. (HAS <-> EMCH) - **TRUE**\n\nNote that Statement 1 and Statement 5 are essentially the same statement, just phrased slightly differently (\"A human is asleep\" vs \"Every human is asleep\"). Given the context of \"A human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel\", it implies a general state for humans, so \"A human is asleep\" can be interpreted as \"Every human is asleep\" or \"All humans are asleep\". If \"A human is asleep\" means \"at least one human is asleep\", then the equivalence holds for that specific human, but the phrasing \"Every human is asleep\" is more precise for the general condition. However, in logical problems, \"A human is X\" often implies \"Every human is X\" when it's part of a general rule. Let's assume \"A human is asleep\" in P4 means \"Every human is asleep\" for consistency with \"every human chased Hazel\". If \"A human is asleep\" meant \"at least one human is asleep\", then P4 would be \"At least one human is asleep <-> Every human chased Hazel\", which is a very strong and potentially problematic claim. Given the options, it's safer to interpret \"A human is asleep\" as \"Every human is asleep\" or \"All humans are asleep\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate the interpretation of \"A human is asleep\" in P4.\nP4: \"A human is asleep (HAS_some) just in case every human chased Hazel (EHCH).\"\nP5: \"Every monkey chased Hazel (EMCH) just in case every human chased Hazel (EHCH).\"\n\nFrom P4 and P5: HAS_some <-> EHCH and EMCH <-> EHCH.\nTherefore, HAS_some <-> EMCH.\n\nNow let's look at the statements again with this distinction:\n\nStatement 1: \"A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\"\nThis is HAS_some <-> EMCH. This must be true.\n\nStatement 5: \"Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\"\nThis is HAS_all <-> EMCH.\nWe know HAS_some <-> EMCH.\nWe also know HAS_all -> HAS_some.\nIf HAS_all is true, then HAS_some is true, which means EMCH is true. So HAS_all -> EMCH.\nIf EMCH is true, then HAS_some is true. Does this mean HAS_all is true? Not necessarily. It's possible that EMCH is true, and only *some* humans are asleep, not *all*.\nTherefore, Statement 5 is not necessarily true under this interpretation.\n\nLet's reconsider the common interpretation in such problems. Often, \"A human is X\" in a general rule implies \"Every human is X\" or \"All humans are X\". If not, the phrasing would typically be \"At least one human is X\". Given the pairing with \"every human chased Hazel\", it strongly suggests \"All humans are asleep\". If \"A human is asleep\" meant \"at least one human is asleep\", then P4 would be \"At least one human is asleep <-> Every human chased Hazel\". This is a very strong and unusual equivalence.\n\nLet's proceed with the more common interpretation that \"A human is asleep\" in P4 refers to the general state of humans, i.e., \"All humans are asleep\" (HAS_all).\n\n**Revised Interpretation:**\n\n*   **P4:** All humans are asleep (HAS_all) just in case every human chased Hazel (EHCH). (HAS_all <-> EHCH)\n*   **P5:** Every monkey chased Hazel (EMCH) just in case every human chased Hazel (EHCH). (EMCH <-> EHCH)\n\nFrom P4 and P5, it directly follows that **HAS_all <-> EMCH**.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the statements with this interpretation:\n\n**1. A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n*   Interpreting \"A human is asleep\" as \"All humans are asleep\" (HAS_all).\n*   This translates to: HAS_all <-> EMCH.\n*   **Must be true.** (Directly derived)\n\n**2. If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n*   This translates to: ~HAS_all -> (EMCH -> ~HCH)\n*   From HAS_all <-> EMCH, if ~HAS_all is true, then ~EMCH must be true.\n*   So, the premise ~HAS_all implies ~EMCH.\n*   If ~EMCH is true, then the consequent (EMCH -> ~HCH) becomes (False -> ~HCH), which is always true.\n*   Therefore, if ~HAS_all is true, the entire statement is true.\n*   **Must be true.**\n\n**3. If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.**\n*   This translates to: ~HAS_all -> (~HCH -> All monkeys are asleep)\n*   As in Statement 2, if ~HAS_all is true, then ~EMCH is true.\n*   The statement is ~HAS_all -> (~HCH -> All monkeys are asleep).\n*   We have no information about \"All monkeys are asleep\" or its relation to ~EMCH or ~HCH.\n*   For example, if ~HAS_all is true (so ~EMCH is true), and ~HCH is true, but not all monkeys are asleep, then the consequent (~HCH -> All",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each (D, H, M are non-empty).\n\nLet's list the given premises and translate them into logical statements:\n\nP1: Alfred didn't chase Alfred. (Self-explanatory)\nP2: No donkeys saw Lewis. $\\forall d \\in D, \\neg \\text{saw}(d, \\text{Lewis})$\nP3: Not all monkeys kicked Lewis. $\\neg (\\forall m \\in M, \\text{kicked}(m, \\text{Lewis}))$\nP4: Lewis isn't a donkey. $\\text{Lewis} \\notin D$\nP5: No donkeys kicked Alfred or Lewis is a donkey. $(\\forall d \\in D, \\neg \\text{kicked}(d, \\text{Alfred})) \\lor (\\text{Lewis} \\in D)$\nP6: A monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is a human. $(\\exists m \\in M, \\text{chased}(m, \\text{Hazel})) \\implies (\\text{Hazel} \\in H)$\nP7: If a human chased Lewis, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   $(\\exists h \\in H, \\text{chased}(h, \\text{Lewis})) \\implies (\\neg \\text{sees}(\\text{Alfred}, \\text{Lewis}) \\iff \\neg (\\forall d \\in D, \\text{kicked}(d, \\text{Hazel})))$\n\nLet's analyze P5 and P4.\nFrom P4, Lewis is not a donkey. So, $\\text{Lewis} \\notin D$ is true.\nTherefore, in P5, \"Lewis is a donkey\" is false.\nFor P5 to be true, \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" must be true.\nSo, from P4 and P5, we deduce:\n**Deduction 1: No donkeys kicked Alfred.** ($\\forall d \\in D, \\neg \\text{kicked}(d, \\text{Alfred})$)\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements based on Deduction 1:\n\n1.  **Every donkey kicked Alfred.** This contradicts Deduction 1. So, this is **False**.\n2.  **Alfred kicked a donkey.** We have no information about Alfred kicking donkeys. This statement is not necessarily true or false.\n3.  **A donkey kicked Alfred.** This contradicts Deduction 1. So, this is **False**.\n4.  **Alfred kicked every donkey.** We have no information about Alfred kicking donkeys. This statement is not necessarily true or false.\n5.  **No donkeys kicked Alfred.** This is exactly **Deduction 1**. So, this is **True**.\n6.  **A human will attack and no humans will attack.** This statement is a contradiction (P AND NOT P). Therefore, it is **False**.\n\nLet's double-check if any other deductions are possible or necessary.\nP1: Alfred didn't chase Alfred. (Doesn't help with the options)\nP2: No donkeys saw Lewis. (Doesn't help with the options)\nP3: Not all monkeys kicked Lewis. (Doesn't help with the options)\nP4: Lewis isn't a donkey. (Used to derive Deduction 1)\nP5: No donkeys kicked Alfred or Lewis is a donkey. (Used to derive Deduction 1)\nP6: A monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is a human.

(This simplifies to: Every donkey was chased by a human).\n4.  **Not all donkeys saw Hazel:** $\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ saw Hazel})$. This means $\\exists d \\in D, d \\text{ did not see Hazel}$.\n5.  **Hazel didn't chase Alfred:** Hazel did not chase Alfred. (This is a specific fact about Hazel and Alfred).\n6.  **Human kicked Lewis OR every human saw Hazel:** $(\\exists h \\in H, h \\text{ kicked Lewis}) \\lor (\\forall h \\in H, h \\text{ saw Hazel})$.\n7.  **Not all donkeys will attack OR a monkey will attack:** $(\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ will attack})) \\lor (\\exists m \\in M, m \\text{ will attack})$. This means $(\\exists d \\in D, d \\text{ will not attack}) \\lor (\\exists m \\in M, m \\text{ will attack})$.\n8.  **Human saw Alfred IFF not all donkeys ate:** $(\\exists h \\in H, h \\text{ saw Alfred}) \\iff (\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, d \\text{ ate}))$. This means $(\\exists h \\in H, h \\text{ saw Alfred}) \\iff (\\exists d \\in D, d \\text{ did not eat})$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the meaning of \"A human chased every donkey.\" This means for every donkey, there exists at least one human who chased it. It does *not* mean one specific human chased all donkeys. It means every donkey was an object of chasing by some human.\n\nLet's denote \"A human chased every donkey\" as P1.\nP1: $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H \\text{ such that } h \\text{ chased } d$.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n**1. Every donkey chased a human.**\n   This means $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H \\text{ such that } d \\text{ chased } h$.\n   The given information states that humans chased donkeys. It does not provide any information about donkeys chasing humans. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. A donkey chased a human.**\n   This means $\\exists d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H \\text{ such that } d \\text{ chased } h$.\n   Similar to statement 1, the given information only describes humans chasing donkeys. There's no information to support donkeys chasing humans. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. Every donkey chased every human.**\n   This means $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H \\text{ such that } d \\text{ chased } h$.\n   This is a very strong claim and is not supported by the given information. It's even stronger than statement 1. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. No donkeys chased every human.**\n   This means $\\neg (\\exists d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ chased } h)$.\n   This is equivalent to $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H, d \\text{ did not chase } h$.\n   We have no information about donkeys chasing humans at all. If donkeys don't chase humans, then it's true that no donkeys chased every human. If some donkeys do chase humans, we still don't know if any single donkey chased *every* human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. A human chased a donkey.**\n   This means $\\exists h \\in H, \\exists d \\in D \\text{ such that } h \\text{ chased } d$.\n   From the given information, \"A human chased every donkey\" ($\\forall d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H \\text{ such that } h \\text{ chased } d$).\n   Since there is at least one donkey (given: \"there's at least one of each\"), let's call it $d_1$.\n   According to the rule, there exists a human, say $h_1$, such that $h_1$ chased $d_1$.\n   Therefore, it is true that \"A human chased a donkey.\" This statement *must* be true.\n\n**6. A donkey chased every human.**\n   This means $\\exists d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H \\text{ such that } d \\text{ chased } h$.\n   This is a strong claim about a single donkey chasing all humans. The given information only describes humans chasing donkeys, not the other way around. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

Not all humans are hungry and every monkey saw Alfred.**\n    *   \"Not all humans are hungry\" is directly given. (True)\n    *   \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" is directly given. (True)\n    *   Since both parts are true, the conjunction is true.\n    *   **Must be true.**\n\n**2. Alfred is hungry.**\n    *   We have no information about Alfred's hunger status. The statements are about monkeys, humans, and Lewis's hunger, and Alfred being kicked/seen.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**3. Alfred isn't hungry.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about Alfred's hunger status.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**4. Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n    *   We don't know if Alfred is hungry.\n    *   We don't know if Lewis is hungry. The conditional statement about Lewis's hunger only tells us what happens *if* he is hungry, not whether he *is* hungry.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**5. No monkeys saw Alfred just in case no humans are hungry.**\n    *   \"No monkeys saw Alfred\" means `\u00ac\u2203x(Mx \u2227 Saw(x, Alfred))`, which is equivalent to `\u2200x(Mx \u2192 \u00acSaw(x, Alfred))`.\n    *   However, we are given that \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" (`\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Saw(x, Alfred))`).\n    *   Therefore, \"No monkeys saw Alfred\" is **false**.\n    *   \"No humans are hungry\" means `\u00ac\u2203x(Hx \u2227 Hungry(x))`. We are given \"Not all humans are hungry\" (`\u2203x(Hx \u2227 \u00acHx_hungry)`), which means there's at least one human who isn't hungry, but it doesn't mean *no* humans are hungry. It's possible some humans are hungry. So, \"No humans are hungry\" is **not necessarily true**.\n    *   The statement is of the form \"P just in case Q\" (P IFF Q). Since P (\"No monkeys saw Alfred\") is false, for the IFF statement to be true, Q (\"No humans are hungry\") would also have to be false. But we don't know if Q is false.\n    *   Since \"No monkeys saw Alfred\" is definitively false based on the given information, this statement cannot be true.\n    *   **Must be false.** (Therefore, not must be true)\n\n**6. If every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.**\n    *   Let's break this down: `(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hungry(x))) \u2192 ((\u00ac\u2203x(Hx \u2227 Hungry(x))) \u2192 Saw(Alfred, Alfred))`\n    *   Consider the consequent: `(\u00ac\u2203x(Hx \u2227 Hungry(x))) \u2192 Saw(Alfred, Alfred)`\n    *   Can Alfred see Alfred? This is a self-referential action. In typical logical contexts, an entity can \"see\" itself. If we assume an entity can see itself, then `Saw(Alfred, Alfred)` is true.\n    *   If `Saw(Alfred, Alfred)` is true, then the implication `(\u00ac\u2203x(Hx \u2227 Hungry(x))) \u2192 Saw(Alfred, Alfred)` is true, regardless of whether \"no humans are hungry\" is true or false (because `False \u2192 True` is true, and `True \u2192 True` is true).\n    *   Since the consequent of the main implication is true (assuming Alfred can see himself), the entire statement `(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Hungry(x))) \u2192 (True)` is true, regardless of whether \"every monkey is hungry\" is true or false.\n    *   **Must be true (assuming Alfred can see himself).**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the assumption for statement 6. The problem doesn't specify rules for self-perception. However, in the absence of information to the contrary, it's generally assumed that an entity can perceive itself. If Alfred *cannot* see himself, then `Saw(Alfred, Alfred)` would be false, and the truth of the statement would depend on other factors. Given the nature of these problems, such an implicit assumption is usually intended.\n\nLet's stick with the most direct interpretations.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   **Statement 1:** \"Not all humans are hungry\" (Given) AND \"every monkey saw Alfred\" (Given). Both are explicitly stated as true. So, 1 is true.\n*   **Statement 5:** \"No monkeys saw Alfred\" is the negation of \"Every monkey saw Alfred\". Since \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" is given as true, \"No monkeys saw Alfred\" is false. A statement \"P just in case Q\" is true only if P and Q have the same truth value. Since P is false, for the whole statement to be true, Q (\"no humans are hungry\") would also have to be false. We don't know if Q is false. However, the statement *cannot* be true if P is false and Q is true. Since P is definitively false, this statement cannot be true.\n*   **Statement 6:** The crucial part is \"Alfred saw Alfred\". If we assume an entity can see itself, then \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is true. If the consequent of an implication is true, the entire implication is true. So, if \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is true, then statement 6 is true. This is a standard assumption in logic puzzles unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, based on direct interpretation and standard logical assumptions:\n\nThe statements that must be true are 1 and 6.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1, 6}$",

(h1 -> m1 and m1 -> h1).\n4.  **Conditional Seeing/Chasing:** (Every human saw Hazel) OR (Every donkey chased Alfred).\n    *   Let P = \"Every human saw Hazel.\"\n    *   Let Q = \"Every donkey chased Alfred.\"\n    *   So, P OR Q is true.\n5.  **Donkey Actions:**\n    *   NOT (Every donkey chased Alfred) -> This means Q is false.\n    *   NOT (Every donkey kicked Alfred).\n\n**Deductions from Given Information:**\n\nFrom point 5, we know that \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\" This directly means that Q is false.\n\nSince (P OR Q) is true and Q is false, it *must* be that P is true.\n\nTherefore, **\"Every human saw Hazel\" (P) must be true.**\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement based on this deduction.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n**Statement 1: Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.**\n*   We know \"Every human saw Hazel\" is true. This implies \"a human saw Hazel\" is true.\n*   So, the right side of the \"if and only if\" (a human saw Hazel) is true.\n*   For the entire statement to be true, \"Hazel isn't a human\" must also be true.\n*   However, we don't have enough information to definitively say whether Hazel is or isn't a human. Hazel could be a human, a monkey, or a donkey. If Hazel is a human, then \"Hazel isn't a human\" is false, making the whole statement false. If Hazel is a monkey or a donkey, then \"Hazel isn't a human\" is true, making the whole statement true.\n*   Since we can't definitively determine Hazel's type, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: Hazel saw a human.**\n*   We know \"Every human saw Hazel.\" This tells us about humans seeing Hazel, not Hazel seeing humans.\n*   Hazel could be a human, a monkey, or a donkey.\n*   If Hazel is a human, then Hazel is one of the humans who saw Hazel (herself), which doesn't imply Hazel saw *another* human.\n*   If Hazel is a monkey or a donkey, we have no information about what Hazel saw.\n*   Consider the human (h1) and monkey (m1) from point 3: h1 saw m1 and m1 saw h1. If Hazel is m1, then Hazel saw h1 (a human). So, it *could* be true.\n*   However, it's not *necessarily* true. Hazel could be a donkey that saw no humans, or a human who only saw herself (if that's possible in the context of \"seeing Hazel\").\n*   We cannot definitively conclude this is true.\n\n**Statement 3: Every human saw Hazel.**\n*   As deduced above, this statement (P) *must* be true because Q is false and (P OR Q) is true.\n\n**Statement 4: No humans saw Hazel.**\n*   This is the direct opposite of \"Every human saw Hazel,\" which we know is true.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 5: Hazel saw every human.**\n*   We know \"Every human saw Hazel.\" This is about humans seeing Hazel.\n*   We have no information about Hazel seeing every human.\n*   Hazel could be a human, a monkey, or a donkey. Even if Hazel is a human, we don't know if she saw *every* human.\n*   This is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n*   This is the negation of \"Every human saw Hazel.\"\n*   Since \"Every human saw Hazel\" is true, its negation must be false.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the logical deductions, only statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

A donkey kicked a human.**\n*   We know `h1` kicked every donkey. This doesn't directly tell us if a donkey kicked a human.\n*   Consider `d1` (the donkey that kicked every monkey). Does `d1` necessarily kick a human? Not based on the given information.\n*   Consider any human `h`. We know `h1` kicked every donkey, so `k(h1, d)` for all `d`. This doesn't imply `k(d, h)` for any `d`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true. We have no information about donkeys kicking humans.\n\n**2. A donkey kicked every human.**\n*   This would mean there exists a donkey `d` such that for every human `h`, `k(d, h)`.\n*   We only know `d1` kicked every monkey. We have no information about any donkey kicking humans.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**3. Every donkey kicked every human.**\n*   This would mean for every donkey `d`, and for every human `h`, `k(d, h)`.\n*   Again, we have no information about donkeys kicking humans.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**4. Every donkey kicked a human.**\n*   This would mean for every donkey `d`, there exists a human `h` such that `k(d, h)`.\n*   Still no information about donkeys kicking humans.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**5. No donkeys kicked every human.**\n*   This is the negation of statement 2: \"A donkey kicked every human.\"\n*   Since statement 2 is \"Not necessarily true,\" its negation \"No donkeys kicked every human\" is also \"Not necessarily true.\" It could be true, or it could be false. We don't have enough information to confirm it.\n*   For example, if there's only one human, and a donkey kicked that human, then \"A donkey kicked every human\" would be true. If there are multiple humans and no donkey kicked all of them, then \"No donkeys kicked every human\" would be true. We simply don't know.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**6. A human kicked a donkey.**\n*   We are given: \"A human kicked every donkey.\"\n*   This means there exists at least one human (let's call them `h1`) such that for *every* donkey `d`, `k(h1, d)`.\n*   Since there is at least one donkey (given: \"there's at least one of each\"), let's call it `d_any`.\n*   From \"A human kicked every donkey,\" we know `h1` kicked `d_any`.\n*   Therefore, `k(h1, d_any)` is true. This means \"A human kicked a donkey\" is true.\n*   **Conclusion:** Must be true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n**6. A human kicked a donkey.**",

This means \u2200d \u00acSL.\n*   **P5:** A monkey chased Alfred (\u2203m CA).\n*   **P6:** A human will run (\u2203h R).\n*   **P7:** Not all donkeys saw Hazel (\u00ac\u2200d SH) AND a human will run (\u2203h R). (This is redundant with P3 and P6, but confirms their truth).\n*   **P8:** If Alfred ate (AE), then every monkey saw Lewis (\u2200m SL) only if a human chased Hazel (\u2203h CH). (AE \u2192 (\u2200m SL \u2192 \u2203h CH))\n*   **P9:** If every monkey chased Hazel (\u2200m CH), then Hazel didn't chase Hazel (\u00acCHH) only if not all donkeys will run (\u00ac\u2200d R). (\u2200m CH \u2192 (\u00acCHH \u2192 \u00ac\u2200d R))\n\n**Analyzing the Premises:**\n\n*   From P3, we know **\u00ac\u2200d SH** is true.\n*   From P5, we know **\u2203m CA** is true.\n*   From P6, we know **\u2203h R** is true.\n*   P7 simply reiterates P3 and P6, confirming their truth.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement.\n\n**Statement 1: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and a monkey chased Alfred.**\n\n*   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true (from P3).\n*   \"A monkey chased Alfred\" is true (from P5).\n*   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every donkey chased Alfred or not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n\n*   We don't have information to confirm or deny \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" (\u2200d CA).\n*   We don't have information to confirm or deny \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\" (\u00ac\u2200m SH).\n*   Since an \"or\" statement can be true if either part is true, and we don't know the truth value of either part, we cannot definitively say this statement must be true. It *could* be true, but it doesn't *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Every donkey chased Alfred unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n\n*   \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"If not B, then A\" or \"A or B\".\n*   So, this statement is equivalent to \"Every donkey chased Alfred or not all monkeys saw Hazel.\"\n*   This is the same as Statement 2, and for the same reasons, we cannot definitively say it must be true.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred will run.**\n\n*   We have no information about Alfred running. We know a human will run (P6), but that doesn't tell us anything about Alfred.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n\n*   We have no information about Alfred running or Lewis running.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Alfred saw Alfred.**\n\n*   Let's break this down: P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R)\n    *   P: \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (\u00ac\u2200d SH)\n    *   Q: \"every monkey chased Hazel\" (\u2200m CH)\n    *   R: \"Alfred saw Alfred\" (ASA)\n\n*   We know P (\u00ac\u2200d SH) is true from P3.\n*   So the statement simplifies to: (\u2200m CH \u2192 ASA).\n*   We have no information about \"every monkey chased Hazel\" (\u2200m CH).\n*   We have no information about \"Alfred saw Alfred\" (ASA).\n*   Since we don't know the truth values of Q or R, we cannot definitively say that (Q \u2192 R) must be true. For example, if Q is true and R is false, then (Q \u2192 R) would be false, making the entire statement false.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say this statement must be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 1 can be definitively concluded as true from the given premises.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Event 1:** A monkey (M1) chased a human (H1) that chased a human (H2).\n    *   This implies M1 chased H1.\n    *   This implies H1 chased H2.\n    *   Crucially, H1 and H2 are humans.\n4.  **Event 2:** Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n    *   This means there is at least one monkey (M_x) who *did not* kick Lewis.\n5.  **Event 3:** Every human chased Alfred.\n    *   This is a universal statement. If 'x' is a human, then 'x' chased Alfred.\n6.  **Event 4 (Conditional):** Alfred didn't kick Hazel ONLY IF not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n    *   This is a logical implication: (Alfred didn't kick Hazel) $\\implies$ (not all monkeys chased Lewis).\n    *   Equivalently, the contrapositive is also true: (All monkeys chased Lewis) $\\implies$ (Alfred kicked Hazel).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 1: Alfred chased a human.**\n\n*   From \"Every human chased Alfred\" (Given 5), we know that if there's at least one human, then that human chased Alfred.\n*   We are told \"there's at least one of each\" (Given 2), which means there is at least one human.\n*   Let H_any be any human. We know H_any chased Alfred.\n*   Does this mean Alfred chased a human? Not necessarily. The direction of chasing is important. \"X chased Y\" means X is the one doing the chasing.\n*   So, \"Every human chased Alfred\" means humans are doing the chasing, and Alfred is being chased. It does not imply Alfred is doing the chasing.\n\n**Statement 2: No humans chased Alfred.**\n\n*   This directly contradicts \"Every human chased Alfred\" (Given 5).\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 3: Not all humans chased Alfred.**\n\n*   This also directly contradicts \"Every human chased Alfred\" (Given 5).\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred chased every human.**\n\n*   From \"Every human chased Alfred\" (Given 5), we know that humans chased Alfred.\n*   This statement claims Alfred chased humans. This is the opposite direction of the given information.\n*   There is no information to support Alfred chasing humans.\n\n**Statement 5: A human chased Alfred.**\n\n*   From \"Every human chased Alfred\" (Given 5), we know that *all* humans chased Alfred.\n*   Since \"there's at least one of each\" (Given 2), there is at least one human.\n*   If there is at least one human, and every human chased Alfred, then it *must* be true that a human (at least one) chased Alfred.\n*   This statement is a direct consequence of Given 5 and Given 2.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred is a human.**\n\n*   We know \"Every human chased Alfred\" (Given 5).\n*   If Alfred were a human, then Alfred would have chased Alfred. While logically possible in some contexts (e.g., self-reflection), there's no information given that forces Alfred to be a human. Alfred could be a donkey or a monkey, and humans could still chase him.\n*   For example, if Alfred is a donkey, and all humans chased him, that's consistent.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred is a human.\n\n**Revisiting the conditional statement (Event 4):**\n\n\"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\"\n(Alfred didn't kick Hazel) $\\implies$ (not all monkeys chased Lewis).\n\nWe also know \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" (Given 4). This is a statement about *kicking*, not *chasing*.\nThe conditional statement uses \"chased Lewis\", not \"kicked Lewis\". This is a crucial distinction.\n\nLet's re-read carefully:\nGiven 4: \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\" (This is a fact)\nGiven 6: \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\" (This is a conditional)\n\nThe conditional statement's consequent is \"not all monkeys chased Lewis\". We don't know if this is true or false.\nThe conditional statement's antecedent is \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\". We don't know if this is true or false.\n\nThis conditional statement, along with \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\", doesn't directly help us evaluate the given options about Alfred and humans. The \"Lewis\" part of the conditional refers to \"chased Lewis\", while the direct fact is about \"kicked Lewis\". These are different actions.\n\nTherefore, the information about Lewis and Hazel doesn't seem to be directly relevant to the truth of statements 1-6, which primarily revolve around Alfred and humans.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   **Statement 1: Alfred chased a human.** False. Humans chased Alfred.\n*   **Statement 2: No humans chased Alfred.** False. Every human chased Alfred.\n*   **Statement 3: Not all humans chased Alfred.** False. Every human chased Alfred.\n*   **Statement 4: Alfred chased every human.** False. Humans chased Alfred.\n*   **Statement 5: A human chased Alfred.** True. Since there's at least one human and every human chased Alfred, it must be true that at least one human chased Alfred.\n*   **Statement 6: Alfred is a human.** False. Not necessarily.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is Statement 5.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem statement and analyze each part.\n\n**Entities:** Donkeys (D), Humans (H), Monkeys (M). These are mutually exclusive categories, and there's at least one of each.\n\n**Given Statements:**\n\n1.  **\"Hazel saw Hazel\"**\n    *   This statement is self-referential. If Hazel exists, then Hazel saw Hazel is a tautology. It doesn't provide much information about other entities.\n\n2.  **\"no donkeys saw Hazel\"**\n    *   This is a direct and clear statement. It means for any donkey 'd', 'd did not see Hazel'.\n\n3.  **\"Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\"**\n    *   Let P be \"all donkeys chased Alfred\".\n    *   Let Q be \"no donkeys chased Alfred\".\n    *   The statement is \"not P just in case Q\".\n    *   \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if\" (iff).\n    *   So, the statement is: (not P) iff Q.\n    *   This translates to: (It is not the case that all donkeys chased Alfred) iff (It is the case that no donkeys chased Alfred).\n    *   Let's analyze this:\n        *   If \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true, then \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" must be true. This implies that if at least one donkey *didn't* chase Alfred, then *no* donkeys chased Alfred. This can only be true if there are no donkeys, or if the set of donkeys that chased Alfred is empty. Since we know there's at least one donkey, this means that if not all donkeys chased Alfred, then *none* of them did.\n        *   If \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is true, then \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" must be true. This is always consistent.\n    *   Consider the implications of \"(not P) iff Q\":\n        *   If P is true (all donkeys chased Alfred), then not P is false. For the iff to hold, Q must be false (it's not the case that no donkeys chased Alfred, meaning at least one donkey chased Alfred). This is consistent.\n        *   If P is false (not all donkeys chased Alfred), then not P is true. For the iff to hold, Q must be true (no donkeys chased Alfred). This means if even one donkey didn't chase Alfred, then *no* donkeys chased Alfred. This implies that the only way for \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" to be true is if \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is true.\n    *   This statement is a bit of a logical puzzle. Let's rephrase \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" as \"there exists at least one donkey that did not chase Alfred\".\n    *   Let A = \"all donkeys chased Alfred\".\n    *   Let N = \"no donkeys chased Alfred\".\n    *   The statement is: (not A) iff N.\n    *   If (not A) is true, then N must be true. This means if there's at least one donkey that didn't chase Alfred, then *all* donkeys didn't chase Alfred. This implies that either all donkeys chased Alfred, or no donkeys chased Alfred. It cannot be the case that some chased and some didn't.\n    *   If N is true, then (not A) must be true. This is always consistent (if no donkeys chased, then it's certainly not true that all donkeys chased).\n    *   So, the core implication of this statement is that the set of donkeys that chased Alfred is either *all* donkeys or *no* donkeys. There's no middle ground where some did and some didn't.\n\n4.  **\"If every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\"**\n    *   Let M_L = \"every monkey saw Lewis\".\n    *   Let A_A = \"Alfred saw Alfred\".\n    *   Let H_H = \"every human saw Hazel\".\n    *   The statement is: M_L -> (A_A -> H_H).\n    *   We know \"Alfred saw Alfred\" is a tautology (assuming Alfred exists). So A_A is true.\n    *   Therefore, the statement simplifies to: M_L -> H_H.\n    *   This means: If every monkey saw Lewis, then every human saw Hazel.\n\n**Analyzing the Options based on the Given Information:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the most direct and certain information:\n\n*   **\"no donkeys saw Hazel\"** (from statement 2)\n    *   This is a definitive statement. It means that for any donkey 'd', 'd did not see Hazel'.\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n\n1.  **\"Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\"**\n    *   If \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" is true, then it is certainly true that \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (because if none saw, then it's impossible for all to have seen).\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n2.  **\"A donkey saw Hazel.\"**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"no donkeys saw Hazel\".\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n3.  **\"Every donkey saw Hazel.\"**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" (unless there are no donkeys, but the problem states there's at least one of each).\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n4.  **\"Hazel saw a donkey.\"**\n    *   The statement \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" tells us about donkeys seeing Hazel. It does *not* tell us about Hazel seeing donkeys.\n    *   It's possible Hazel saw a donkey, and it's possible Hazel did not see any donkeys.\n    *   We cannot determine if this is true or false.\n\n5.  **\"Hazel saw every donkey.\"**\n    *   Similar to option 4, this tells us about Hazel seeing donkeys, not donkeys seeing Hazel.\n    *   We cannot determine if this is true or false.\n\n6.  **\"Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\"**\n    *   We already established that \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" must be true (from statement 1 and the given \"no donkeys saw Hazel\").\n    *   However, the second part is \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\".\n    *   The problem explicitly states \"Hazel saw Hazel\". So, \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" must be false.\n    *   Since the statement is a conjunction (\"A but B\"), and the second part is false, the entire statement must be false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct implication of \"no donkeys saw Hazel\", only statement 1 must be true. The other complex statements (about Alfred and monkeys/humans) do not affect the truth value of the options related to Hazel and donkeys seeing each other, given the direct contradiction or lack of information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

It doesn't directly help with the relationships between species, but confirms an individual.\n2.  **A donkey saw every monkey.** This means there exists at least one donkey, let's call it $d_0 \\in D$, such that for all $m \\in M$, $d_0$ saw $m$.\n3.  **Every donkey chased every human that chased it.** This is the crucial rule for \"chasing\". For any $d \\in D$ and any $h \\in H$:\n    If $h$ chased $d$, then $d$ chased $h$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: A donkey chased a human.**\n*   This means there exists $d \\in D$ and $h \\in H$ such that $d$ chased $h$.\n*   Consider the possibility that no donkey chased any human. This would mean that for all $d \\in D$ and all $h \\in H$, $d$ did not chase $h$.\n*   From rule (3), if $h$ chased $d$, then $d$ chased $h$.\n*   If no donkey chased any human, then it must be the case that no human chased any donkey (because if a human $h$ chased a donkey $d$, then $d$ would have chased $h$, contradicting our assumption).\n*   Is it possible that no human chased any donkey, and therefore no donkey chased any human? Yes. The rules don't *force* any chasing to happen.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every donkey chased every human.**\n*   This means for all $d \\in D$ and for all $h \\in H$, $d$ chased $h$.\n*   This is a very strong claim. As discussed for Statement 1, no chasing is necessarily implied by the rules.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 3: No donkeys chased every human.**\n*   This means it is *not* true that \"a donkey chased every human\". In other words, for every donkey $d \\in D$, there exists at least one human $h \\in H$ such that $d$ did not chase $h$.\n*   Again, the rules don't force any chasing. It's possible that no donkey chased any human at all (as per the analysis of Statement 1). If no donkey chased any human, then it's certainly true that no donkey chased *every* human.\n*   So, this statement *could* be true, but it doesn't *must* be true. It's also possible that a donkey *did* chase every human (if, for example, every human chased that donkey).\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 4: Every donkey chased a human.**\n*   This means for every $d \\in D$, there exists at least one $h \\in H$ such that $d$ chased $h$.\n*   Similar to Statement 1, the rules do not force any donkey to chase any human. It's possible that no human chased any donkey, and thus no donkey chased any human.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey chased every human.**\n*   This means there exists $d_0 \\in D$ such that for all $h \\in H$, $d_0$ chased $h$.\n*   Again, the rules do not force this. It's possible that no human chased any donkey, and thus no donkey chased any human.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 6: A donkey chased every human that chased it.**\n*   Let's re-read the given rule (3): \"Every donkey chased every human that chased it.\"\n*   This rule can be rephrased as: For every donkey $d$, $d$ chased every human $h$ such that $h$ chased $d$.\n*   The statement \"A donkey chased every human that chased it\" means: There exists at least one donkey $d_0 \\in D$ such that for every human $h \\in H$, if $h$ chased $d_0$, then $d_0$ chased $h$.\n*   Compare this to the given rule (3): \"Every donkey chased every human that chased it.\"\n    *   Given rule: $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H: (h \\text{ chased } d) \\implies (d \\text{ chased } h)$\n    *   Statement 6: $\\exists d_0 \\in D, \\forall h \\in H: (h \\text{ chased } d_0) \\implies (d_0 \\text{ chased } h)$\n\n*   The given rule (3) states that this condition holds for *every* donkey. If it holds for *every* donkey, then it *must* hold for *at least one* donkey (since we know there's at least one donkey).\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 is a direct logical consequence of the given rule (3) and the fact that the set of donkeys is non-empty.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

Therefore, $P_3$ is true.\n    *   So, the statement simplifies to: $P_1 \\implies (P_2 \\implies \\text{True})$.\n    *   Since $(P_2 \\implies \\text{True})$ is always true regardless of $P_2$'s truth value, the entire implication $P_1 \\implies (P_2 \\implies \\text{True})$ is always true.

That is, $\\forall d_2 \\in D, C(h^*, d_2)$.\nIf such a human $h^*$ exists, then from statement 2, for any donkey $d_1 \\in D$, $C(d_1, h^*)$ must be true.\nSo, if there is a human who chased every donkey, then every donkey chased that human.\n\nNow, let's combine this with statement 1.\nSuppose there exists a human $h^*$ such that $h^*$ chased every donkey ($\\forall d_2 \\in D, C(h^*, d_2)$).\nFrom statement 2, it implies that for any donkey $d_1 \\in D$, $C(d_1, h^*)$.\nSo, for any $d_1 \\in D$, we have $C(d_1, h^*)$ and $C(h^*, d_1)$.\nHowever, statement 1 says that $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, \\neg (C(d, h) \\land C(h, d))$.\nThis means we cannot have both $C(d_1, h^*)$ and $C(h^*, d_1)$ simultaneously.\nThis is a contradiction.\nTherefore, our assumption that \"there exists a human $h^*$ such that $h^*$ chased every donkey\" must be false.\nThis implies that **no human chased every donkey**.\nThis is statement 3 from the options.\n\nLet's verify this deduction.\nAssume for contradiction that there exists a human $h_0 \\in H$ such that $h_0$ chased every donkey.\nSo, $\\forall d \\in D, C(h_0, d)$.\nBy statement 2, since $h_0$ chased every donkey, it must be that every donkey chased $h_0$.\nSo, $\\forall d \\in D, C(d, h_0)$.\nNow, pick an arbitrary donkey $d_x \\in D$.\nFrom the first point, $C(h_0, d_x)$.\nFrom the second point, $C(d_x, h_0)$.\nSo we have $C(d_x, h_0) \\land C(h_0, d_x)$.\nBut statement 1 says $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, \\neg (C(d, h) \\land C(h, d))$.\nThis means it's impossible to have $C(d_x, h_0) \\land C(h_0, d_x)$.\nThis is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the assumption that there exists a human who chased every donkey must be false.\nSo, **No humans chased every donkey** must be true.\n\nLet's check the options:\n1.  **A donkey chased every human.** (False. We don't have enough information to conclude this. For example, if there's only one human, say $h_1$, and one donkey, say $d_1$, and $C(d_1, h_1)$ is true, then this statement is true. But if there are two humans $h_1, h_2$ and $d_1$ only chased $h_1$, then it's false.)\n2.  **Every donkey chased a human.** (False. We don't have enough information. Statement 3 only guarantees that *a* donkey chased *a* human, not that *every* donkey chased *a* human.)\n3.  **No humans chased every donkey.** (True, as derived above.)\n4.  **No donkeys chased a human.** (False. Statement 3 says \"A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human\", which implies there exists at least one donkey that chased a human.)\n5.  **No donkeys chased every human.** (False. This is not necessarily true. For example, if there is only one human $h_1$, then \"No humans chased every donkey\" means $\\neg C(h_1, d)$ for some $d$. But it doesn't prevent a donkey from chasing $h_1$. If there is only one human $h_1$, and $D=\\{d_1\\}$, then \"No humans chased every donkey\" means $\\neg C(h_1, d_1)$. But this doesn't prevent $C(d_1, h_1)$. If $C(d_1, h_1)$ is true, then \"A donkey chased every human\" is true, which contradicts this statement. Let's re-evaluate.\n    If \"No humans chased every donkey\" is true, then for every human $h$, there exists at least one donkey $d$ such that $h$ did not chase $d$.\n    This statement (5) is \"$\\forall d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H, \\neg C(d, h)$\". This is not necessarily true.\n    Consider the case where there is only one human $h_1$. Then \"No humans chased every donkey\" means $\\neg (\\forall d \\in D, C(h_1, d))$. So there exists $d_0 \\in D$ such that $\\neg C(h_1, d_0)$.\n    This doesn't prevent a donkey $d_1$ from chasing $h_1$. If $d_1$ chased $h_1$, then \"A donkey chased every human\" (if $h_1$ is the only human) would be true. So statement 5 would be false.\n    So statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n    Let's consider the negation of statement 5: \"There exists a donkey that chased every human.\"\n    Can this be true? Yes. For example, if there is only one human $h_1$, and $d_1$ chased $h_1$. This is consistent with \"No humans chased every donkey\" (if $h_1$ didn't chase $d_1$).\n    So statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **Every donkey chased every human.** (False. This is a very strong statement and we have no information to support it. If this were true, then combined with statement 1, it would imply that no human chased any donkey. But statement 3 implies that a human chased a donkey. So this is false.)\n\nLet's re-check the reasoning for option 3.\n1. $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, \\neg (C(d, h) \\land C(h, d))$\n2. $\\forall d_1 \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, ((\\forall d_2 \\in D, C(h, d_2)) \\implies C(d_1, h))$\n\nAssume for contradiction that \"No humans chased every donkey\" is false.\nThis means its negation is true: \"There exists a human who chased every donkey.\"\nLet this human be $h^*$. So, $\\exists h^* \\in H$ such that $\\forall d \\in D, C(h^*, d)$.\n\nNow, apply statement 2 with this $h^*$:\nSince $\\forall d_2 \\in D, C(h^*, d_2)$ is true, then for any $d_1 \\in D$, $C(d_1, h^*)$ must be true.\nSo, $\\forall d_1 \\in D, C(d_1, h^*)$.\n\nNow we have two facts:\n(A) $\\forall d \\in D, C(h^*, d)$\n(B) $\\forall d \\in D, C(d, h^*)$\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary donkey $d_0 \\in D$. (We know $D$ is non-empty).\nFrom (A), $C(h^*, d_0)$.\nFrom (B), $C(d_0, h^*)$.\nSo, we have $C(d_0, h^*) \\land C(h^*, d_0)$.\n\nHowever, statement 1 says: $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, \\neg (C(d, h) \\land C(h, d))$.\nThis means it is impossible to have $C(d_0, h^*) \\land C(h^*, d_0)$.\nThis is a direct contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that \"There exists a human who chased every donkey\" must be false.\nThis means \"No humans chased every donkey\" must be true.\n\nThe third statement \"A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human\" ($\\exists m \\in M, \\exists d \\in D, \\exists h \\in H, (C(m, d) \\land C(d, h))$) is used to ensure that the sets are not empty and that there is at least one instance of chasing. It doesn't directly contribute to the deduction of \"No humans chased every donkey\", but it confirms the existence of elements in the sets and some chasing relationships, which are necessary for the problem to be meaningful. For example, if there were no donkeys, the statements would be vacuously true or false in different ways. The problem states \"there's at least one of each\", which is consistent with statement 3.\n\nFinal check of the options:\n1. A donkey chased every human. (Not necessarily true)\n2. Every donkey chased a human. (Not necessarily true)\n3. No humans chased every donkey. (Must be true, as derived",

(This implies a symmetric \"saw\" relationship within monkeys, or at least that for every monkey A, there's a monkey B such that A saw B and B saw A).\n*   A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.

The information about Alfred, Lewis, Hazel, and hunger seems designed to be a distractor for the statements about monkeys. Let's focus on the monkey-related information.\n\nThe crucial piece of information for monkeys is: \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\"\n\nLet M be the set of monkeys.\nFor every m1 \u2208 M, there exists an m2 \u2208 M such that m1 saw m2 AND m2 saw m1.\n\nLet's denote \"A saw B\" as S(A, B).\nSo, for all m1 \u2208 M, \u2203 m2 \u2208 M such that S(m1, m2) \u2227 S(m2, m1).\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n1.  **There is a monkey that every monkey saw.**\n    This means \u2203 m_x \u2208 M such that \u2200 m_y \u2208 M, S(m_y, m_x).\n    Consider a scenario with two monkeys, M1 and M2.\n    If M1 saw M2 and M2 saw M1, the condition \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it\" is satisfied.\n    Does M1 see M1? Does M2 see M1? Does M1 see M2? Does M2 see M2?\n    If M1 only saw M2, and M2 only saw M1, then there is no monkey that *every* monkey saw. M1 didn't see M1, M2 didn't see M2. M1 didn't see M2 (from M2's perspective), M2 didn't see M1 (from M1's perspective).\n    This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **No monkeys saw every monkey.**\n    This means \u00ac(\u2203 m_x \u2208 M such that \u2200 m_y \u2208 M, S(m_x, m_y)).\n    This is the negation of \"A monkey saw every monkey\" (statement 4).\n    Consider a scenario with two monkeys, M1 and M2.\n    If M1 saw M2 and M2 saw M1.\n    If M1 also saw M1, and M2 also saw M2.\n    The condition \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it\" is satisfied.\n    Could M1 have seen M1 and M2? Yes. Could M2 have seen M1 and M2? Yes.\n    If M1 saw M1 and M2, and M2 saw M1 and M2, then M1 saw every monkey, and M2 saw every monkey. In this case, statement 2 would be false.\n    So, statement 2 is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Every monkey saw every monkey.**\n    This means \u2200 m_x \u2208 M, \u2200 m_y \u2208 M, S(m_x, m_y).\n    Consider the two-monkey scenario again: M1 and M2.\n    If M1 saw M2 and M2 saw M1. This satisfies the given condition.\n    But it doesn't necessarily mean M1 saw M1, or M2 saw M2.\n    It also doesn't mean M1 saw M2 *and* M2 saw M1 *and* M1 saw M1 *and* M2 saw M2.\n    This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **A monkey saw every monkey.**\n    This means \u2203 m_x \u2208 M such that \u2200 m_y \u2208 M, S(m_x, m_y).\n    This is the negation of \"No monkeys saw every monkey\" (statement 2).\n    Similar to the reasoning for statement 2, this is not necessarily true. We can construct a scenario where no single monkey saw all other monkeys (including itself). For example, if M1 saw M2, M2 saw M1, and these are the only \"saw\" relations. Then M1 didn't see M1, and M2 didn't see M2. So neither saw \"every\" monkey.\n\n5.  **A monkey saw a monkey.**\n    This means \u2203 m_x \u2208 M, \u2203 m_y \u2208 M such that S(m_x, m_y).\n    The given condition states: \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\"\n    Let's pick any monkey, say M1 (we know there's at least one monkey).\n    According to the condition, M1 saw *some* monkey, say M2, and M2 saw M1.\n    So, S(M1, M2) is true.\n    Therefore, there exists a monkey (M1) that saw a monkey (M2).\n    This statement *must* be true.\n\n6.  **No monkeys saw a monkey.**\n    This means \u00ac(\u2203 m_x \u2208 M, \u2203 m_y \u2208 M such that S(m_x, m_y)).\n    This is the negation of \"A monkey saw a monkey\" (statement 5).\n    Since statement 5 must be true, its negation must be false.\n    Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information, specifically \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it\" and \"there's at least one of each [type of creature, including monkeys]\", is statement 5. The other information about Alfred, Lewis, Hazel, and hunger is irrelevant to the monkey-related statements.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(This means Lewis exists and is seen by at least one human).\n    *   Alfred is happy. (This is a distraction, likely irrelevant to the sight relationships).\n    *   It is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel. This is a double negative.\n        *   \"Not (Hazel doesn't see Hazel)\" is equivalent to \"Hazel sees Hazel\".\n\n**Deductions from Given Information:**\n\n*   **Hazel sees Hazel:** From \"it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel\". This is a definite truth.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the deductions.\n\n*   **Key Deduction:** Hazel sees Hazel.\n\n1.  **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   \"A human saw Lewis\" - Given.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" means \"Lewis sees Hazel\".\n    *   We know \"A human saw Lewis\" is true. We have no information about whether Lewis sees Hazel. So, we cannot confirm this statement.\n\n2.  **Lewis saw Lewis just in case a human saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"Lewis saw Lewis\" - We have no information about this.\n    *   \"a human saw Hazel\" - We have no information about this.\n    *   Since we don't know the truth value of either part, we cannot confirm this biconditional.\n\n3.  **A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"A human saw Lewis\" - Given. (True)\n    *   \"Hazel saw Hazel\" - Deduced from \"it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel\". (True)\n    *   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire statement is true.\n\n4.  **Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"Lewis saw Lewis\" - Unknown.\n    *   \"not all humans saw Hazel\" - Unknown.\n    *   Cannot confirm.\n\n5.  **A human saw Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   \"A human saw Lewis\" - Given. (True)\n    *   \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" - We have no information about this.\n    *   Since we don't know the truth value of the second conjunct, we cannot confirm this statement.\n\n6.  **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"A human saw Lewis\" - Given. (True)\n    *   \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" means \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\".\n    *   We deduced that \"Hazel sees Hazel\" is true. Therefore, \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" is false.\n    *   Since the second conjunct is false, the entire statement is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the given information and logical deductions, only statement 3 must be true. The information about Alfred being happy and the complex human-monkey-donkey sight rule (Every human saw every monkey that saw every donkey) are not needed to evaluate these specific statements, as the key deduction comes from the double negative regarding Hazel.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

The key deduction comes from Alfred's unhappiness and the rule about human happiness.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

Or, (EDCA) if not (EHSLH).\n10. **No humans chased Hazel (NHCH) ONLY IF Lewis chased Lewis (LCL).** This is a conditional statement: If (NHCH) then (LCL).\n\n**Analyzing the Given Information:**\n\n*   From (3), we know **NDKH is true**.\n*   From (4), we know **AH is true**.\n*   From (5), we know **MH is true**.\n*   From (7), we know **A~SL is true**.\n*   From (8), we have (HKL) OR (A~SL). Since (A~SL) is true, the entire disjunction is true, but we cannot definitively say if HKL is true or false.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's go through each statement and determine if it *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis are happy.**\n*   We know Alfred is happy (AH is true).\n*   We don't have any information about Lewis's happiness. Lewis could be happy or not happy.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 2: A monkey kicked Hazel or every donkey is happy.**\n*   Let MKL = \"A monkey kicked Hazel\".\n*   Let EDH = \"Every donkey is happy\".\n*   The statement is (MKL) OR (EDH).\n*   We know NDKH (No donkeys kicked Hazel) is true. This means no donkey kicked Hazel. It doesn't tell us anything about whether a monkey kicked Hazel. A monkey *could* have kicked Hazel, or not.\n*   We don't have any information about whether every donkey is happy. Some donkeys could be happy, all could be happy, or none could be happy.\n*   Since neither part of the disjunction is guaranteed to be true, and we can't deduce either, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 3: A monkey kicked Hazel unless every donkey is happy.**\n*   This is equivalent to: IF NOT (Every donkey is happy) THEN (A monkey kicked Hazel).\n*   Or: IF (Every donkey is happy) THEN NOT (A monkey kicked Hazel).\n*   Or: (A monkey kicked Hazel) OR (Every donkey is happy). (This is the same as Statement 2).\n*   As explained for Statement 2, this does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 4: No donkeys kicked Hazel and a monkey is happy.**\n*   Let NDKH = \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\".\n*   Let MH = \"A monkey is happy\".\n*   The statement is (NDKH) AND (MH).\n*   From the given information (3), **NDKH is true**.\n*   From the given information (5), **MH is true**.\n*   Since both conjuncts are true based on the given information, their conjunction *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 5: A monkey kicked Hazel unless no donkeys are happy.**\n*   This is equivalent to: IF NOT (No donkeys are happy) THEN (A monkey kicked Hazel).\n*   Or: IF (Some donkeys are happy) THEN (A monkey kicked Hazel).\n*   Or: (A monkey kicked Hazel) OR (No donkeys are happy).\n*   We don't know if a monkey kicked Hazel.\n*   We don't know if no donkeys are happy (i.e., if all donkeys are unhappy).\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 6: A monkey kicked Hazel or no donkeys are happy.**\n*   This is the same as Statement 5.\n*   As explained for Statement 5, this does not *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Statement 4 is directly and unequivocally supported by the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

Lewis eating doesn't tell us if *all* monkeys ate, or if *no* monkeys saw Lewis. Lewis could be a human, a donkey, or a monkey. If Lewis is a monkey, then Lewis ate, but that doesn't mean *all* monkeys ate, nor does it mean *not all* monkeys ate.

Alfred saw every monkey.**\n    *   We know \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\" This is the inverse of \"Alfred saw every monkey.\" Just because A saw B doesn't mean B saw A. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**3. A monkey saw Alfred.**\n    *   Since \"Every monkey saw Alfred,\" and we know there's at least one monkey (from point 2), it logically follows that at least one monkey (in fact, all of them) saw Alfred. This statement must be true.\n\n**4. Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**5. Alfred ate.**\n    *   We have no information about Alfred's eating habits. We only know Lewis ate. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. Alfred saw a monkey.**\n    *   We know \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\" This does not imply that Alfred saw any monkey. For example, Alfred could be blind, or looking the other way.

Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude anything about Alfred attacking (statement 5) based solely on this.\n\n---\n\n**Evaluating Each Statement:**\n\n1.  **No monkeys chased a monkey that chased it.**\n    *   From \"Every monkey chased every monkey,\" we know that if monkey A chased monkey B, then monkey B also chased monkey A (because B chased *every* monkey, including A).\n    *   So, for any two monkeys A and B, if A chased B, then B chased A.\n    *   The statement says \"No monkeys chased a monkey that chased it.\" This means if A chased B, then B *didn't* chase A. This directly contradicts \"Every monkey chased every monkey.\"\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 **must be false**.\n\n2.  **There is not a monkey that every monkey chased.**\n    *   From \"Every monkey chased every monkey,\" we know that *every* monkey was chased by *every* monkey.\n    *   This means that for *any* monkey (let's call it X), every other monkey (and X itself) chased X.\n    *   So, there *is* a monkey (in fact, every monkey) that every monkey chased.\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 **must be false**.\n\n3.  **No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n    *   From \"Every monkey chased every monkey,\" we know that *every* monkey chased *every* monkey.\n    *   This means that for *any* monkey (let's call it Y), Y chased every other monkey (and Y itself).\n    *   So, it's true that every monkey chased every monkey.\n    *   The statement says \"No monkeys chased every monkey,\" which is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, statement 3 **must be false**.\n\n4.  **A monkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   From \"Every monkey chased every monkey,\" we know that *every single monkey* chased *every single monkey*.\n    *   This directly implies that there exists at least one monkey (in fact, all of them) that chased every monkey.\n    *   Therefore, statement 4 **must be true**.\n\n5.  **Alfred will attack.**\n    *   We know \"Alfred kicked Lewis.\" This tells us Alfred exists.\n    *   We also have the condition: \"A monkey will attack OR not all monkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    *   This is a disjunction. We cannot conclude that \"A monkey will attack\" is true. It's possible that \"not all monkeys saw Hazel\" is true, and \"A monkey will attack\" is false.\n    *   Even if \"A monkey will attack\" is true, we don't know if Alfred is a monkey. Alfred could be a human or a donkey.\n    *   Therefore, statement 5 **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n6.  **No monkeys chased a monkey.**\n    *   From \"Every monkey chased every monkey,\" we know that *every* monkey chased *every* monkey.\n    *   This means that monkeys *did* chase monkeys.\n    *   The statement says \"No monkeys chased a monkey,\" which is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, statement 6 **must be false**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(This means at least one monkey will not run).\n4.  **Donkey Seeing Hazel (1):** Not all donkeys saw Hazel. (This means at least one donkey did not see Hazel).\n5.  **Donkey Seeing Hazel (2):** No donkeys saw Hazel. (This means *all* donkeys did not see Hazel).\n    *   **Contradiction/Refinement:** Statement 5 (\"No donkeys saw Hazel\") is stronger than statement 4 (\"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\"). If no donkeys saw Hazel, then it's automatically true that not all donkeys saw Hazel. So, we can take \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" as the definitive truth regarding donkeys seeing Hazel.\n6.  **Human Seeing Alfred:** Every human saw Alfred.\n7.  **Conditional Statement:** If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n    *   Let P = \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\"\n    *   Let Q = \"Hazel kicked Alfred\"\n    *   Let R = \"Every monkey saw Hazel\"\n    *   The statement is: P -> (Q -> R)\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the given information to ensure consistency.\n*   \"Not all monkeys will run\" (True)\n*   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (True)\n*   \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" (True) - This implies \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is also true. So, the definitive fact is \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n*   \"Every human saw Alfred\" (True)\n\nNow let's consider the options:\n\n**1. Alfred will run.**\nWe have no information about Alfred's running status. Alfred is a specific individual, but we don't know if Alfred is a donkey, human, or monkey, nor do we have any rules connecting \"seeing Alfred\" or \"kicking Alfred\" to \"running.\" Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will run.\n\n**2. Hazel will run.**\nSimilar to Alfred, we have no information about Hazel's running status. We know Hazel might kick Alfred, or be seen by monkeys, but nothing about running. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel will run.\n\n**3. Hazel and Alfred will run.**\nSince we cannot conclude either Hazel will run or Alfred will run, we certainly cannot conclude both will run.\n\n**4. Not all monkeys will run and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n*   \"Not all monkeys will run\" is explicitly stated as true in the problem description.\n*   \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" is explicitly stated as true in the problem description.\nSince both conjuncts are explicitly stated as true, this entire statement must be true.\n\n**5. Alfred won't run.**\nWe have no information about Alfred's running status. We cannot conclude Alfred won't run.\n\n**6. Alfred and Hazel will run.**\nThis is the same as statement 3, just rephrased. We cannot conclude this.\n\n**Conclusion based on direct information:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the explicit information provided is statement 4. The conditional statement \"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel\" is a conditional, and we don't know if its antecedent (\"not all donkeys kicked Alfred\") is true or false, so we cannot deduce anything from it directly about Hazel or Alfred's actions unless we know the truth value of the antecedent.

A monkey saw Alfred.**\n    *   If \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" is true, then it logically follows that at least one monkey (in fact, all of them) saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **2. No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\" Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **3. Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   This also directly contradicts \"Every monkey saw Alfred.\" Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **4. Alfred will run.**\n    *   There is no information in the given statements that allows us to deduce whether Alfred will run or not. The last conditional statement (\"If a human chased Lewis, then not all donkeys will run only if Lewis won't run\") involves Lewis and donkeys running, but doesn't provide any direct or indirect information about Alfred running. Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false.\n\n*   **5. Alfred saw every monkey.**\n    *   We know \"Every monkey saw Alfred,\" but this does not imply that \"Alfred saw every monkey.\" Seeing is not necessarily reciprocal. For example, a security camera (a \"monkey\" in this analogy) might see everyone, but not everyone sees the camera. Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false.\n\n*   **6. Alfred saw a monkey.**\n    *   Similar to statement 5, knowing \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" does not tell us if Alfred saw any monkey. Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information provided, only statement 1 can be definitively concluded as true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means it's impossible for \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" to be true, because if a monkey kicked Hazel, then a donkey *didn't* kick Hazel (which is consistent with DH), but it doesn't force a monkey to kick Hazel.\nThe statement \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" is not necessarily true.\nThe statement \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\" is not necessarily true.\nSince \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true, it's highly unlikely that \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" is true. If no donkeys kicked Hazel, it doesn't tell us anything about monkeys kicking Hazel.\nLet's re-evaluate \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\". This means for any donkey X, X did not kick Hazel.

So, a monkey *could* have kicked Hazel.\n\nLet P = \"A monkey kicked Hazel\"\nLet Q = \"Every donkey kicked Lewis\"\nThe statement is \"P unless Q\", which is equivalent to \"not Q -> P\" or \"P or Q\".\n\nWe know \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true.

This is a definite fact.\nIf \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" is true, then statement 1 is true.\nIf \"A monkey kicked Hazel\" is false, then for statement 1 to be true, \"every donkey kicked Lewis\" must be true. We don't know this.\nSo, statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: No donkeys kicked Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.**\n*   \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" is TRUE (from point 5).\n*   \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is TRUE (from point 7).\nSince both conjuncts are true, the entire statement is TRUE.\n\n**Statement 3: Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey kicked Hazel.**\nThis is \"A unless B\", which means \"If not B, then A\" or \"A or B\".\nLet A = \"Lewis is a donkey\"\nLet B = \"A monkey kicked Hazel\"\nSo, \"Lewis is a donkey or a monkey kicked Hazel\".\nWe know \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze the given information.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Chasing Rule:** Every human chased a monkey. (This is a crucial statement).\n4.  **Hazel & Alfred:** Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n5.  **Human Action:** A human will run.\n6.  **Hunger:** Alfred isn't hungry.\n7.  **Hunger:** Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n**Analysis of the Chasing Rule:**\n\n\"Every human chased a monkey.\"\n\nLet's represent this formally:\nFor every individual 'x', if 'x' is a Human (H(x)), then there exists an individual 'y' such that 'y' is a Monkey (M(y)) AND 'x' chased 'y' (C(x,y)).\n$\\forall x (H(x) \\implies \\exists y (M(y) \\land C(x,y)))$\n\nThis means that for *each* human, they chased *at least one* monkey. It does *not* mean they chased *every* monkey, nor does it mean they chased *the same* monkey, nor does it mean they chased *only one* monkey. It simply guarantees that for any given human, there's at least one monkey they chased.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's go through each statement and see if it *must* be true based on the given information.\n\n1.  **No humans chased a monkey.**\n    *   This directly contradicts the given rule: \"Every human chased a monkey.\"\n    *   **False.**\n\n2.  **No humans chased every monkey.**\n    *   The given rule states \"Every human chased *a* monkey\" (meaning at least one). It does *not* preclude a human from chasing *every* monkey. For example, if there's only one monkey, then every human would have chased that one monkey, which means they chased every monkey. Or, even with multiple monkeys, one human *could* have chased all of them. The rule doesn't forbid this.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n3.  **A human chased every monkey.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, the given rule \"Every human chased a monkey\" does not guarantee that *some* human chased *all* monkeys. It only guarantees that *each* human chased *at least one* monkey. There could be multiple monkeys, and different humans chased different subsets of them, with no single human chasing all of them.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n4.  **There is a human that every monkey chased.**\n    *   This means there's a specific human 'H1' such that for every monkey 'M_i', H1 chased M_i.\n    *   The given rule is \"Every human chased *a* monkey\" (human -> monkey). This statement is about \"every monkey chased *a* human\" (monkey -> human). The direction is reversed, and the quantifier is different. The original rule doesn't imply this.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n5.  **Every human chased every monkey.**\n    *   The given rule is \"Every human chased *a* monkey.\" This means for each human, there's *at least one* monkey they chased. It does *not* mean they chased *all* monkeys. For example, if Human A chased Monkey X, and Human B chased Monkey Y, and there are Monkeys X, Y, and Z, then the rule is satisfied, but neither human chased every monkey (they didn't chase Z).\n    *   **False.**\n\n6.  **A human chased a monkey.**\n    *   The given rule is \"Every human chased a monkey.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one human (given: \"there's at least one of each\"), and every human chased a monkey, it logically follows that *some* human (at least one) must have chased *some* monkey (at least one).\n    *   If there's at least one human (let's call them H1), then according to the rule, H1 chased *a* monkey (let's call it M1). Therefore, \"A human (H1) chased a monkey (M1)\" is true.\n    *   **True.**\n\n**Irrelevant Information:**\n\n*   Hazel didn't chase Alfred: This tells us something specific about Hazel and Alfred, but doesn't affect the general \"human chased monkey\" rule. We don't even know if Hazel or Alfred are humans or monkeys.\n*   A human will run: This is about future action and doesn't relate to the past \"chased\" action.\n*   Alfred isn't hungry and Lewis isn't hungry: This is completely irrelevant to the chasing dynamics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased solely on the statement \"Every human chased a monkey\" and the existence of at least one human, the only statement that *must* be true is that \"A human chased a monkey.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

(Some M -> Alfred: kicked)\n*   **Rule 4 (Conditional):** If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then (not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no donkeys ate).\n\n**Analysis of the Statements:**\n\nLet's denote \"kicked\" as 'K'.\n\n*   **Rule 1:** For every monkey $m \\in M$ and every donkey $d \\in D$, $m \\text{ K } d$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one donkey, say $d_0$, such that for every monkey $m$, $d_0 \\text{ K } m$.\n    *   The given rules state that monkeys kicked donkeys, not necessarily the other way around. We have no information about donkeys kicking monkeys.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**2. A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one donkey $d$ and at least one monkey $m$ such that $d \\text{ K } m$.\n    *   Similar to statement 1, we have no information about donkeys kicking monkeys.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**3. No donkeys kicked every monkey.**\n    *   This means for every donkey $d$, there exists at least one monkey $m$ such that $d$ did not kick $m$.\n    *   Again, we have no information about donkeys kicking monkeys. This statement could be true or false depending on unstated facts.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**4. Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n    *   This means for every donkey $d$ and every monkey $m$, $d \\text{ K } m$.\n    *   This is the inverse of Rule 1. Rule 1 states \"Every monkey kicked every donkey.\" This does not imply the inverse.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**5. Every donkey kicked a monkey.**\n    *   This means for every donkey $d$, there exists at least one monkey $m$ such that $d \\text{ K } m$.\n    *   Similar to the previous statements, we have no information about donkeys kicking monkeys.\n    *   **Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**6. A monkey kicked every donkey.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one monkey, say $m_0$, such that for every donkey $d$, $m_0 \\text{ K } d$.\n    *   Let's look at Rule 1: \"Every monkey kicked every donkey.\"\n    *   This rule implies that *for any given monkey*, that monkey kicked *every* donkey.\n    *   Since there is at least one monkey (given \"there's at least one of each\"), let's call one such monkey $m_X$.\n    *   According to Rule 1, $m_X$ kicked every donkey.\n    *   Therefore, \"A monkey kicked every donkey\" must be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 6 is directly supported and necessitated by the given information.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and deduce what must be true.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a donkey (D), a human (H), or a monkey (M).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Alfred's Species:** Alfred is a donkey (A is D).\n4.  **Alfred's Action:** Alfred kicked Alfred (A kicked A).\n5.  **Donkey's State:** A donkey is happy (D => Happy).\n6.  **Alfred's Non-Human Status OR Donkey Happiness:** Alfred isn't a human (A is not H) OR every donkey is happy (\u2200D => Happy).\n7.  **Donkey Happiness Condition:** Every donkey is happy (\u2200D => Happy) UNLESS a monkey kicked Alfred (M kicked A).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **From (3): Alfred is a donkey.**\n*   **From (5): A donkey is happy.** Since Alfred is a donkey, it follows that **Alfred is happy.** (This directly confirms statement 3).\n*   **From (6): Alfred isn't a human OR every donkey is happy.**\n    *   We know Alfred is a donkey (from 3), so Alfred isn't a human. This part of the disjunction is true.\n    *   Therefore, the entire statement (6) is true, regardless of whether \"every donkey is happy\" is true. This statement doesn't give us new information about \"every donkey is happy.\"\n*   **From (7): Every donkey is happy UNLESS a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n    *   This can be rephrased as: (A monkey kicked Alfred) => NOT (Every donkey is happy).\n    *   Or, equivalently: (Every donkey is happy) OR (A monkey kicked Alfred).\n    *   Let's consider the contrapositive: NOT (Every donkey is happy) => (A monkey kicked Alfred).\n\nNow, let's use the fact that Alfred is a donkey and \"A donkey is happy\" (from 5).\nSince Alfred is a donkey, and \"A donkey is happy\" means *any* donkey is happy, it implies that **every donkey is happy**. If there was a donkey that wasn't happy, then the statement \"A donkey is happy\" would be false (as it implies all donkeys are happy, or at least that the property of being a donkey implies happiness). The phrasing \"A donkey is happy\" is typically interpreted as \"All donkeys are happy\" in such logical puzzles, or \"If something is a donkey, then it is happy.\" Given \"Alfred is a donkey\" and \"A donkey is happy\", Alfred must be happy. If \"A donkey is happy\" meant \"at least one donkey is happy\", it wouldn't be very useful. The most natural interpretation is that the property of being a donkey implies happiness.\n\nSo, let's assume \"A donkey is happy\" means \"Every donkey is happy\" (\u2200D => Happy).\n\nIf \"Every donkey is happy\" is true, then from statement (7):\n\"Every donkey is happy UNLESS a monkey kicked Alfred.\"\nSince \"Every donkey is happy\" is true, the \"UNLESS\" clause must be false.\nTherefore, \"a monkey kicked Alfred\" must be false.\nThis means **No monkey kicked Alfred.**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the statements:\n\n1.  **No donkeys kicked Alfred.** We know Alfred kicked Alfred, and Alfred is a donkey. So, a donkey (Alfred) *did* kick Alfred. Therefore, this statement is **False**.\n2.  **A donkey kicked Alfred.** We know Alfred kicked Alfred, and Alfred is a donkey. So, yes, a donkey (Alfred) kicked Alfred. Therefore, this statement is **True**.\n3.  **Alfred is happy.** Alfred is a donkey (from 3). A donkey is happy (from 5). Therefore, Alfred is happy. This statement is **True**.\n4.  **Alfred kicked every donkey.** We only know Alfred kicked Alfred. We don't have information about Alfred kicking any other donkeys. We know there's at least one donkey (Alfred), but there could be others. This statement is **Not necessarily true**.\n5.  **Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.** We know Alfred kicked Alfred. If there are other donkeys, we don't know if they kicked Alfred. If Alfred is the *only* donkey, then \"all donkeys\" (i.e., Alfred) *did* kick Alfred, making this statement false. If there are other donkeys, and they didn't kick Alfred, then this statement would be true. We cannot definitively say this is true. This statement is **Not necessarily true**.\n6.  **Every donkey kicked Alfred.** We only know Alfred kicked Alfred. We don't know if any other donkeys (if they exist) kicked Alfred. This statement is **Not necessarily true**.\n\n**Final Check on \"A donkey is happy\" interpretation:**\n\nIf \"A donkey is happy\" means \"At least one donkey is happy,\" then:\n*   Alfred is a donkey.\n*   Alfred is happy (because Alfred is a donkey and \"A donkey is happy\" means there's at least one happy donkey, and Alfred could be that one, or it could mean that the property of being a donkey implies happiness). The most robust interpretation for \"A donkey is happy\" in a logical context is \"If something is a donkey, then it is happy.\" This makes Alfred happy.\n*   If \"Every donkey is happy\" is *not* necessarily true from \"A donkey is happy\", then statement (7) becomes more complex.\n    *   (Every donkey is happy) OR (A monkey kicked Alfred).\n    *   We know Alfred is happy. This doesn't automatically mean *every* donkey is happy.\n    *   If \"Every donkey is happy\" is false, then (A monkey kicked Alfred) must be true.\n    *   But if \"Every donkey is happy\" is true, then (A monkey kicked Alfred) must be false.\n\nLet's stick to the standard interpretation: \"A donkey is happy\" means \"All donkeys are happy\" or \"If something is a donkey, it is happy.\" This is the most common interpretation in such puzzles to allow for logical deduction.\n\nUnder this interpretation:\n*   From (5) \"A donkey is happy\" => **Every donkey is happy.**\n*   From (7) \"Every donkey is happy UNLESS a monkey kicked Alfred.\"\n    *   Since \"Every donkey is happy\" is true, the \"UNLESS\" condition must be false.\n    *   Therefore, \"a monkey kicked Alfred\" is false. **No monkey kicked Alfred.**\n\nNow let's re-evaluate the options with this strong conclusion:\n\n1.  **No donkeys kicked Alfred.** False. Alfred is a donkey and Alfred kicked Alfred.\n2.  **A donkey kicked Alfred.** True. Alfred is a donkey and Alfred kicked Alfred.\n3.  **Alfred is happy.** True. Alfred is a donkey and \"A donkey is happy\" (meaning all donkeys are happy).\n4.  **Alfred kicked every donkey.** Not necessarily true. We only know Alfred kicked Alfred.\n5.  **Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.** Not necessarily true. If Alfred is the only donkey, then all donkeys (Alfred) did kick Alfred, making this false. If there are other donkeys who didn't kick Alfred, it would be true. We don't know.\n6.  **Every donkey kicked Alfred.** Not necessarily true. We only know Alfred kicked Alfred.\n\nTherefore, statements 2 and 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2, 3}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).** This means these are the only three categories, and an individual belongs to exactly one.\n2.  **There's at least one of each.** So, there's at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3.  **No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it.** This is a crucial negative statement. If donkey A saw donkey B, then donkey B did *not* see donkey A. Or, more simply, for any two distinct donkeys A and B, if A saw B, then B did not see A. This also implies that no donkey saw itself (if A saw A, then A saw a donkey that saw it, which is forbidden).\n4.  **A human is happy.** This tells us something about the state of humans, but doesn't directly relate to running or seeing for the named individuals.\n5.  **Lewis saw Alfred.** This is a direct observation.\n6.  **Not all donkeys will run.** This means there is at least one donkey that will *not* run.\n7.  **Lewis is a donkey.** This is a direct classification.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nSince Lewis is a donkey, let's apply the rules for donkeys.\n\nFrom point 3: \"No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it.\"\nThis implies two things for any donkey X:\n    a. X did not see X (a donkey cannot see itself).\n    b. If X saw Y (where Y is also a donkey), then Y did not see X.\n\nNow let's look at the specific individuals: Lewis and Alfred.\n\nWe know:\n*   Lewis is a donkey.\n*   Lewis saw Alfred.\n\n**Consider Alfred's type:**\n\n*   **Could Alfred be a donkey?**\n    If Alfred were a donkey, then Lewis (a donkey) saw Alfred (a donkey).\n    According to rule 3, if Lewis saw Alfred, then Alfred cannot have seen Lewis. This is consistent.\n    However, rule 3 also states \"No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it.\" This also implies that no donkey saw itself. If Alfred were a donkey, and Lewis saw Alfred, then Lewis saw a donkey. If Alfred also saw Lewis, then Lewis saw a donkey (Alfred) that saw it (Lewis). This is forbidden.\n    Let's re-read rule 3 carefully: \"No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it.\"\n    Let X be a donkey. Let Y be a donkey.\n    If X saw Y AND Y saw X, then this situation is forbidden.\n    Also, if X saw X, then X saw a donkey (itself) that saw it (itself). This is forbidden.\n    So, no donkey sees itself.\n\n    If Alfred is a donkey:\n    1. Lewis is a donkey.\n    2. Alfred is a donkey.\n    3. Lewis saw Alfred.\n    From rule 3, since Lewis is a donkey, Lewis cannot have seen a donkey (Alfred) that saw Lewis.\n    Therefore, Alfred did *not* see Lewis. This is consistent with rule 3.\n    So, Alfred *could* be a donkey.\n\n*   **Could Alfred be a human or a monkey?**\n    Yes, there's nothing in the rules that prevents a donkey from seeing a human or a monkey, or vice-versa.\n\nSo, Alfred's type is not definitively determined by the seeing relationship alone.\n\nLet's re-evaluate rule 3: \"No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it.\"\nThis means: For any donkey D1 and any donkey D2:\nIF D1 saw D2 AND D2 saw D1, THEN this scenario is impossible.\nThis also implies: For any donkey D: D did not see D. (If D saw D, then D saw a donkey (itself) that saw it (itself), which is forbidden).\n\nSince Lewis is a donkey:\n*   Lewis did not see Lewis (from rule 3, applied to Lewis seeing itself).\n\nNow let's evaluate the statements:\n\n**1. Lewis will run.**\n*   We know Lewis is a donkey.\n*   We know \"Not all donkeys will run.\" This means there is at least one donkey that will *not* run.\n*   However, this doesn't tell us anything specific about Lewis. Lewis *could* be one of the donkeys that runs, or Lewis *could* be the donkey that doesn't run.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. Alfred won't run.**\n*   We don't know Alfred's species.\n*   We don't know anything about humans or monkeys running or not running.\n*   Even if Alfred were a donkey, we don't know if Alfred is one of the donkeys that runs or one of the donkeys that doesn't run.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. Lewis doesn't see Lewis.**\n*   Lewis is a donkey.\n*   From rule 3: \"No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it.\"\n*   If Lewis saw Lewis, then Lewis saw a donkey (itself) that saw it (itself). This is exactly what rule 3 forbids.\n*   Therefore, Lewis cannot see Lewis. This statement **must be true**.\n\n**4. Lewis saw Lewis.**\n*   As established in the analysis for statement 3, this is forbidden by rule 3.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**5. Alfred will run.**\n*   Similar to statement 2, we don't know Alfred's species or running status.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n*   This combines the uncertainties of Alfred running and Lewis running.\n*   Since neither is necessarily true, their conjunction is also not necessarily true.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This is the reverse direction.\n*   Does d chasing m necessarily follow from m chasing d? No.\n*   Consider a scenario: Monkey A chased Donkey X. Donkey X did not chase Monkey A. This is consistent with the given information.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n*   This means: For all d in D, there exists m in M such that d did not chase m.\n*   This is the negation of Statement 1.\n*   Since Statement 1 is not necessarily true, its negation is also not necessarily true. It *could* be true, or it could be false.\n*   For example, if there's only one donkey, and it chased all monkeys, then Statement 1 would be true, and Statement 2 would be false.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: A donkey chased a monkey.**\n*   This means: There exists d in D and there exists m in M such that d chased m.\n*   We know: Every monkey chased every donkey. (m chased d).\n*   We have no information that implies a donkey *must* chase a monkey.\n*   Consider a scenario: Monkey A chased Donkey X. Monkey B chased Donkey X. Donkey X chased no monkeys. This is consistent with the given information.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n*   This means: For all d in D, for all m in M, d chased m.\n*   We know: Every monkey chased every donkey (m chased d).\n*   This is the reverse direction and is not implied.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n*   This means: For all d in D, there exists m in M such that d chased m.\n*   This is weaker than Statement 4, but still not implied.\n*   We know m chased d. We don't know d chased m.\n*   Consider a scenario: Donkey X exists. Monkey A exists. Monkey A chased Donkey X. Donkey X chased no monkeys. This is consistent with the given information.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n*   This means: There exists d in D such that for all m in M, m chased d.\n*   Let's re-examine Fact 1: \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\"\n    *   This can be written as: For all m in M, (for all d in D, m chased d).\n*   The statement 6 is: There exists d in D such that (for all m in M, m chased d).\n\nLet's compare:\nFact 1: $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, \\text{chased}(m, d)$\nStatement 6: $\\exists d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, \\text{chased}(m, d)$\n\nFact 1 says that for *any* monkey, that monkey chased *all* donkeys.\nStatement 6 says that there is *some specific* donkey that *all* monkeys chased.\n\nLet's test Statement 6 with Fact 1.\nIf Fact 1 is true, then for any donkey $d_0$ you pick, *every* monkey chased $d_0$.\nSince we know there is at least one donkey (D is non-empty), let's pick an arbitrary donkey, say $d_x$.\nAccording to Fact 1, \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\" This means that for $d_x$, *every* monkey chased $d_x$.\nThis is exactly what Statement 6 says: \"There is a donkey (namely $d_x$) that every monkey chased.\"\n\nTherefore, Statement 6 *must* be true given Fact 1 and the existence of at least one donkey.\n\nLet's re-verify the interpretation of \"Every monkey chased every donkey.\"\nThis means:\nMonkey1 chased Donkey1, Monkey1 chased Donkey2, ...\nMonkey2 chased Donkey1, Monkey2 chased Donkey2, ...\n...\nIf this is true, then pick any Donkey (e.g., Donkey1). Did every monkey chase Donkey1? Yes, by definition of \"every monkey chased every donkey\".\nSo, there exists a donkey (any donkey will do) that every monkey chased.\n\nFinal check:\nFact 1: $\\forall m \\in M, \\forall d \\in D, C(m, d)$\nStatement 6: $\\exists d_0 \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, C(m, d_0)$\n\nSince D is non-empty, let $d_0$ be any element of D.\nFrom Fact 1, we know that for this specific $d_0$, it is true that $\\forall m \\in M, C(m, d_0)$.\nThis directly implies Statement 6.\n\nThe other facts (about Hazel and Lewis) are irrelevant to the relationship between donkeys and monkeys chasing each other.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

If \"every\" has a property, then \"a\" (at least one) must have that property.\n\n6.  **A donkey chased every donkey.**\n    *   This means: There exists d1 in D such that for all d2 in D, C(d1, d2).\n    *   This means at least one donkey chased all other donkeys (including itself, if d1=d2).\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on the given information, especially statement (2): \"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\"\n\nStatement (2) implies that the chasing relation among donkeys is symmetric.\nLet's consider the implications of this symmetry.\n\n*   If there is at least one donkey, say D1.\n*   If D1 chased D1, then C(D1, D1) is true.\n*   If D1 did not chase D1, then C(D1, D1) is false.\n\nConsider the case where there is only one donkey, say D1.\nStatement (2) becomes: If C(D1, D1), then C(D1, D1). This is a tautology and doesn't force D1 to chase itself or not.\n\nConsider the case where there are two donkeys, D1 and D2.\n*   If C(D1, D2), then C(D2, D1).\n*   If C(D2, D1), then C(D1, D2).\n*   This means C(D1, D2) <=> C(D2, D1).\n\nNow let's look at the options again:\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.**\n*   This statement is directly implied by given statement (2).\n*   Given (2): \"For all d1 in D, for all d2 in D: If C(d2, d1), then C(d1, d2).\"\n*   Statement 5: \"There exists d1 in D such that for all d2 in D: If C(d2, d1), then C(d1, d2).\"\n*   If a property holds for *every* element in a non-empty set, then it must hold for *at least one* element in that set. Since we are told there is at least one donkey, statement 5 must be true.\n\nLet's check if any other statements *must* be true.\n\nCould \"Every donkey chased every donkey\" (Statement 2) be true? Not necessarily. The symmetry doesn't force universal chasing. For example, if no donkey chased any other donkey (including themselves), then the condition \"If C(d2, d1), then C(d1, d2)\" is vacuously true (the antecedent C(d2, d1) is always false). In this scenario, \"Every donkey chased every donkey\" would be false.\n\nCould \"No donkeys chased every donkey\" (Statement 1) be true? Not necessarily. If there's a donkey D1 that chased every other donkey, and the relation is symmetric, then every other donkey D2 also chased D1. This is possible.\n\nCould \"A donkey chased a donkey\" (Statement 3) be true? Not necessarily. As mentioned above, it's possible that no donkey chased any donkey (including themselves). In this case, C(d1, d2) is always false, and the symmetry condition (2) is still met.\n\nCould \"Every donkey chased a donkey\" (Statement 4) be true? Not necessarily. If no donkey chased any donkey, then this would be false.\n\nCould \"A donkey chased every donkey\" (Statement 6) be true? Not necessarily. This is a stronger version of \"A donkey chased a donkey\". If no donkey chased any donkey, this would be false.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is the one that is a direct logical consequence of a given premise, specifically a weaker",

(This is a self-referential statement, often true for any entity that can \"see\" but not itself in that context, or it implies Hazel is not a type of being that can see itself in that way. For logical purposes, we take it as a given fact.)\n4.  **Donkeys' Sight (Hazel):** No donkeys saw Hazel.\n5.  **Lewis's Type:** Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6.  **Donkeys' Attack/Humans' Sight:** Not all donkeys will attack OR every human saw Hazel.\n\n**Let's represent the key facts derived from the given information:**\n\n*   **F1:** Hazel doesn't see Hazel. (From 3)\n*   **F2:** No donkeys saw Hazel. (From 4)\n*   **F3:** Lewis isn't a donkey. (From 5)\n*   **F4:** (Not all donkeys will attack) OR (Every human saw Hazel). (From 6)\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\n*   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\": This is the negation of \"All donkeys saw Hazel\". From F2, we know \"No donkeys saw Hazel\", which implies \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (if no one saw, then certainly not everyone saw). So, this part is TRUE.\n*   \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey\": This simplifies to \"Lewis is a donkey\". From F3, we know \"Lewis isn't a donkey\". So, this part is FALSE.\n*   Since the statement is \"TRUE but FALSE\", the entire statement 1 is **FALSE**.\n\n**Statement 2: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n\n*   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\": As established for Statement 1, this is TRUE (because no donkeys saw Hazel).\n*   \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\": We have no information about whether Lewis sees Hazel or not. Lewis could be a human or a monkey. We cannot definitively say this is true or false.\n*   Since we cannot confirm the second part, we cannot confirm the entire conjunction. Therefore, this statement is **NOT NECESSARILY TRUE**.\n\n**Statement 3: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n\n*   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\": As established, this is TRUE.\n*   \"it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel\": This simplifies to \"Lewis sees Hazel\". Again, we have no information about whether Lewis sees Hazel.\n*   Since we cannot confirm the second part, we cannot confirm the entire conjunction. Therefore, this statement is **NOT NECESSARILY TRUE**.\n\n**Statement 4: Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n\n*   This statement is of the form \"P AND NOT P\" (where P is \"every monkey kicked Lewis\").\n*   \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" is the negation of \"Every monkey kicked Lewis\".\n*   A statement of the form \"X AND NOT X\" is a contradiction and is always **FALSE**.\n\n**Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Lewis.**\n\n*   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\": As established, this is TRUE.\n*   \"no donkeys saw Lewis\": We have no information about whether donkeys saw Lewis. We only know \"no donkeys saw Hazel\".\n*   Since we cannot confirm the second part, we cannot confirm the entire conjunction. Therefore, this statement is **NOT NECESSARILY TRUE**.\n\n**Statement 6: Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n\n*   \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\": This is directly given as F1. So, this part is TRUE.\n*   \"Lewis isn't a donkey\": This is directly given as F3. So, this part is TRUE.\n*   Since both parts are TRUE, the entire statement 6 is **TRUE**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

This could be true or false.\n    *   Since the first part of the \"or\" statement is false, the truth of the entire statement depends on the second part. Since we don't know if Lewis kicked Lewis, we cannot definitively say this statement must be true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**6. A human kicked Lewis.**\n    *   From statement (2), we know \"No humans kicked Lewis.\"\n    *   This directly contradicts \"A human kicked Lewis.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

If Lewis *were* a donkey, then Lewis couldn't have seen Lewis (which is a bit self-referential and doesn't directly help here).\n*   We don't know Lewis's species. Lewis could be a human, a monkey, or a donkey.\n*   We don't know if Alfred sees Lewis.\n*   This statement is a disjunction. If either part is true, the whole statement is true. We cannot definitively say this must be true. For example, if Lewis is a human and Alfred *does* see Lewis, then both parts are false, making the statement false. So, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 3: Lewis is a donkey unless Alfred doesn't see Lewis.**\n*   \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"If not B then A\" or \"A or B\".\n*   So, this statement is equivalent to \"Lewis is a donkey or Alfred doesn't see Lewis\".\n*   This is the exact same as Statement 2, which we determined is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 4: If Alfred doesn't see Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis.**\n*   \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\": $\\neg \\text{saw}(\\text{Alfred}, \\text{Alfred})$\n*   \"a donkey saw Lewis\": $\\exists x (x \\in D \\land \\text{saw}(x, \\text{Lewis}))$\n*   From given info 2, we know \"No donkeys saw Lewis\". This means $\\neg \\exists x (x \\in D \\land \\text{saw}(x, \\text{Lewis}))$, which is equivalent to $\\forall x (x \\in D \\implies \\neg \\text{saw}(x, \\text{Lewis}))$.\n*   Therefore, the consequent \"a donkey saw Lewis\" is **false**.\n*   In a conditional statement \"If P then Q\", if Q is false, then for the statement to be true, P must also be false. If P is true and Q is false, the statement is false.\n*   We don't know if \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is true or false.\n*   However, since the consequent is false, the only way for the entire conditional statement to be true is if the antecedent is also false. If the antecedent were true, the statement would be false. Since we cannot guarantee the antecedent is false, we cannot guarantee this statement is true. So, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 5: Lewis is a donkey or it is not the case that Alfred doesn't see Lewis.**\n*   \"Lewis is a donkey\": $\\text{Lewis} \\in D$\n*   \"it is not the case that Alfred doesn't see Lewis\" means $\\neg (\\neg \\text{saw}(\\text{Alfred}, \\text{Lewis}))$, which simplifies to $\\text{saw}(\\text{Alfred}, \\text{Lewis})$.\n*   So, the statement is: \"Lewis is a donkey or Alfred sees Lewis.\"\n*   This is a disjunction. We don't know Lewis's species, nor do we know if Alfred sees Lewis.\n*   Similar to Statement 2, we cannot definitively say this must be true. So, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 6: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.**\n*   \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true (from given info 2).\n*   \"Lewis saw Alfred\" is true (from given info 3).\n*   Since both parts of this conjunction are true, the entire statement is **true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

This is logically consistent.\n    *   However, the information doesn't *force* Alfred to be a donkey. Alfred could be a human or a monkey, and still, no donkeys would have seen him.\n    *   **Must be true? No.**\n\n2.  **Every donkey saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts the given information: \"No donkeys saw Alfred.\"\n    *   **Must be true? No.** (In fact, it must be false).\n\n3.  **Alfred saw a donkey.**\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Alfred.\" This tells us about donkeys seeing Alfred, not Alfred seeing donkeys.\n    *   Alfred could be a human or a monkey. There are donkeys in this world. It's possible Alfred saw one, or possible Alfred didn't. The given information doesn't provide enough to confirm or deny this.\n    *   **Must be true? No.**\n\n4.  **A donkey saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts the given information: \"No donkeys saw Alfred.\"\n    *   **Must be true? No.** (In fact, it must be false).\n\n5.  **Not all donkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   The given information states: \"No donkeys saw Alfred.\"\n    *   If \"No donkeys saw Alfred,\" it means that for every donkey, that donkey did not see Alfred.\n    *   This implies that the set of donkeys who saw Alfred is empty.\n    *   If the set of donkeys who saw Alfred is empty, then it is certainly true that not all donkeys saw Alfred (because zero donkeys saw Alfred, and there's at least one donkey in existence).\n    *   If \"all donkeys saw Alfred\" were true, it would mean every single donkey saw Alfred. But we are told *no* donkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, it cannot be the case that all donkeys saw Alfred.\n    *   Thus, \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" must be true.\n    *   **Must be true? Yes.**\n\n6.  **Alfred saw every donkey.**\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Alfred.\" This doesn't tell us about Alfred's actions.\n    *   Alfred could be a human or a monkey. There are donkeys. It's possible Alfred saw all of them, or only some, or none. The information doesn't specify.\n    *   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n**5.

(\u00ac\u2203d1 \u2208 D \u2200d2 \u2208 D (d2 chased d1))\n4.  **Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.** Let C(x, y) denote \"x chased y\".\n    This translates to: \u2200d1 \u2208 D ( (\u2200d2 \u2208 D (d2 chased every human)) => C(d1, d2) )\n    Let's simplify the antecedent: \"d2 chased every human\" means \u2200h \u2208 H (C(d2, h)).\n    So, the statement is: \u2200d1 \u2208 D ( (\u2203d2 \u2208 D (\u2200h \u2208 H (C(d2, h)))) => C(d1, d2) )\n    *Correction*: The phrasing \"every donkey that chased every human\" refers to a *set* of donkeys. Let S be the set of donkeys that chased every human. S = {d' \u2208 D | \u2200h \u2208 H (C(d', h))}.\n    The statement is: \u2200d \u2208 D \u2200d' \u2208 S (C(d, d')).\n    In simpler terms: If there is any donkey that chased every human, then every donkey chased that donkey.\n5.  **Not all monkeys will run but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.** These statements seem irrelevant to the relationships between donkeys and humans, and chasing. They are likely distractors.\n\n**Analyzing Statement 4 (Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human):**\n\nLet S be the set of donkeys that chased every human. S = {d' \u2208 D | \u2200h \u2208 H, C(d', h)}.\nThe statement says: \u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200d' \u2208 S, C(d, d').\n\nNow, let's consider two cases for S:\n\n**Case 1: S is empty (S = \u2205).**\nThis means there is no donkey that chased every human.\nIf S is empty, then the implication \"\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200d' \u2208 S, C(d, d')\" is vacuously true. It doesn't tell us anything about donkeys chasing humans.\n\n**Case 2: S is not empty (S \u2260 \u2205).**\nThis means there exists at least one donkey, let's call it `d_s`, such that `d_s` chased every human (\u2200h \u2208 H, C(d_s, h)).\nIf S is not empty, then according to statement 4, every donkey chased every donkey in S.\nSo, if `d_s` \u2208 S, then for every donkey `d` \u2208 D, C(d, d_s).\n\nNow, let's combine this with statement 3: \"There is not a donkey that every donkey chased.\"\nThis means: \u00ac\u2203x \u2208 D (\u2200y \u2208 D, C(y, x)).\nOr, equivalently: \u2200x \u2208 D \u2203y \u2208 D (\u00acC(y, x)).\n\nIf S is not empty, then there exists `d_s` \u2208 D such that `d_s` chased every human.\nAnd, for this `d_s`, we know that every donkey `d` \u2208 D chased `d_s` (C(d, d_s)).\nBut this directly contradicts statement 3, which says there is *no* donkey that every donkey chased.\n\nTherefore, **S must be empty.**\n\n**Conclusion from the contradiction:**\nThe assumption that S is not empty leads to a contradiction with statement 3.\nThus, S must be empty.\n**S = \u2205** means: **There is no donkey that chased every human.**\nIn other words: **\u00ac\u2203d \u2208 D (\u2200h \u2208 H, C(d, h)).**\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n\n1.  **A donkey chased a human.** (\u2203d \u2208 D \u2203h \u2208 H, C(d, h))\n    We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this. Our conclusion is about *every* human, not *a* human.\n\n2.  **A donkey chased every human.** (\u2203d \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H, C(d, h))\n    This is precisely the negation of our conclusion (S = \u2205). So, this statement must be **false**.\n\n3.  **Every donkey chased a human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D \u2203h \u2208 H, C(d, h))\n    We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this. Our conclusion is about *every* human, not *a* human.\n\n4.  **Every donkey chased every human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H, C(d, h))\n    If this were true, then every donkey would be in the set S. But we concluded S is empty. So, this statement must be **false**.\n\n5.  **No donkeys chased every human.** (\u00ac\u2203d \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H, C(d, h))\n    This is exactly our conclusion (S = \u2205). This statement must be **true**.\n\n6.  **No donkeys chased a human.** (\u00ac\u2203d \u2208 D \u2203h \u2208 H, C(d, h))\n    This means no donkey chased any human. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   Statement 3: \u00ac\u2203d1 \u2208 D \u2200d2 \u2208 D (C(d2, d1))\n*   Statement 4: \u2200d1 \u2208 D ( (\u2203d2 \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H (C(d2, h))) => C(d1, d2) )\n    Let P = (\u2203d2 \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H (C(d2, h))) (i.e., S is not empty).\n    Statement 4 is: \u2200d1 \u2208 D (P => C(d1, d2))\n    If P is true, then there exists some d_s such that \u2200h \u2208 H (C(d_s, h)).\n    And if P is true, then for every d1 \u2208 D, C(d1, d_s).\n    This means that d_s is a donkey that every donkey chased.\n    But statement 3 says there is *not* a donkey that every donkey chased.\n    Therefore, P must be false.\n    P is false means: \u00ac(\u2203d2 \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H (C(d2, h)))\n    Which simplifies to: \u2200d2 \u2208 D \u00ac(\u2200h \u2208 H (C(d2, h)))\n    Which means: \u2200d2 \u2208 D \u2203h \u2208 H (\u00acC(d2, h))\n    This is \"For every donkey, there is at least one human it did not chase.\"\n\n    Let's re-evaluate the interpretation of statement 4.\n    \"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\"\n    Let X = {d' \u2208 D | \u2200h \u2208 H, C(d', h)}. (This is our S)\n    The statement is: \u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200d' \u2208 X, C(d, d').\n\n    If X is non-empty, let d* be an element of X.\n    Then, by statement 4, for every donkey d, C(d, d*).\n    This means d* is a donkey that every donkey chased.\n    However, statement 3 says: \"There is not a donkey that every donkey chased.\"\n    This is a direct contradiction.\n    Therefore, X must be empty.\n\n    X = \u2205 means: There is no donkey that chased every human.\n    This is equivalent to: \u00ac(\u2203d \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H, C(d, h)).\n\n    Now let's re-evaluate the options:\n\n    1.  A donkey chased a human. (\u2203d \u2208 D \u2203h \u2208 H, C(d, h)) - Cannot be determined.\n    2.  A donkey chased every human. (\u2203d \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H, C(d, h)) - This is the negation of our conclusion. So, **False**.\n    3.  Every donkey chased a human. (\u2200d \u2208 D \u2203h \u2208 H, C(d, h)) - Cannot be determined.\n    4.  Every donkey chased every human. (\u2200d \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H, C(d, h)) - If this were true, then every donkey would be in X, but X is empty. So, **False**.\n    5.  No donkeys chased every human. (\u00ac\u2203d \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H, C(d, h)) - This is exactly our conclusion. So, **True**.\n    6.  No donkeys chased a human. (\u00ac\u2203d \u2208 D \u2203h \u2208 H, C(d, h)) - Cannot be determined.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 5.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(m1 -> m2 and m2 -> m1). This implies a reciprocal chasing relationship among monkeys.\n*   **Monkey Chasing Rule 2:** A monkey (m_a) chased a donkey (d_b) that chased a human (h_c). (m_a -> d_b and d_b -> h_c).\n*   **Conditional Statement:** If every human is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel. (This statement seems to be a distractor for the monkey/chasing logic, as it doesn't directly relate to the chasing relationships we need to evaluate.)\n\n**Analyzing the Chasing Relationships Among Monkeys:**\n\nThe crucial rule is: \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\"\n\nLet's represent monkeys as M1, M2, M3, ...\nIf M1 is a monkey, then M1 chased some M2, and M2 chased M1. (M1 -> M2 and M2 -> M1).\nThis means that for every monkey, there's at least one other monkey (or itself) with whom it has a reciprocal chasing relationship.\n\nConsider a set of monkeys S = {M1, M2, ..., Mn}.\nFor every Mi in S, there exists an Mj in S such that Mi -> Mj and Mj -> Mi.\n\n**Evaluating Each Statement:**\n\n1.  **No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n    *   This statement claims that for every monkey M, there is at least one other monkey it *didn't* chase.\n    *   Could it be false? If it's false, then there *is* a monkey (let's call it M_super) that chased *every* monkey (including itself).\n    *   If M_super chased every monkey, then for any other monkey M_x, M_super -> M_x.\n    *   From the rule \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it,\" M_x must have chased some M_y such that M_y -> M_x.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true. Consider a scenario with two monkeys, M1 and M2. If M1 chased M2 and M2 chased M1, then M1 did not chase M1, and M2 did not chase M2. In this case, \"No monkeys chased every monkey\" would be true.\n    *   However, if we had M1 -> M1, M1 -> M2, M2 -> M1, M2 -> M2. Then M1 chased every monkey (M1 and M2). In this case, statement 1 would be false.\n    *   The rule \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it\" doesn't preclude a monkey from chasing *all* other monkeys (including itself).\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n2.  **There is a monkey that every monkey chased.**\n    *   This statement claims there exists a monkey (let's call it M_target) such that for every monkey M_x, M_x -> M_target.\n    *   Let's test this. Suppose there are two monkeys, M1 and M2.\n        *   From the rule: M1 chased M_a and M_a chased M1. M2 chased M_b and M_b chased M2.\n        *   If M1 -> M2 and M2 -> M1, then M1 is chased by M2, and M2 is chased by M1.\n        *   Is there a monkey that *every* monkey chased?\n            *   If M1 is the target, then M2 must chase M1. (True in our example). M1 must chase M1. (Not necessarily true).\n            *   If M2 is the target, then M1 must chase M2. (True in our example). M2 must chase M2. (Not necessarily true).\n    *   Consider a scenario where M1 -> M2 and M2 -> M1. No monkey is chased by *every* monkey (unless there's only one monkey).\n    *   If there's only one monkey, M1. Then M1 chased M1 (because M1 chased a monkey that chased M1, and that monkey must be M1 itself). In this case, M1 is chased by M1, so \"There is a monkey that every monkey chased\" is true.\n    *   However, the problem states \"at least one of each\" (donkey, human, monkey), but doesn't specify the number of monkeys.\n    *   If there are two monkeys, M1 and M2, and M1 -> M2 and M2 -> M1. Then M1 is chased by M2, but not by M1 (unless M1->M1). M2 is chased by M1, but not by M2 (unless M2->M2). So, in this common scenario, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n3.  **Every monkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means for any two monkeys M_i and M_j (possibly M_i = M_j), M_i -> M_j.\n    *   If this were true, then for any M_i, M_i chased M_j, and M_j chased M_i (since M_j also chased every monkey). This would satisfy the rule \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\"\n    *   However, the rule \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it\" does *not* imply that every monkey chased every monkey.\n    *   Consider M1 -> M2 and M2 -> M1. M1 did not chase M1. M2 did not chase M2. So, \"Every monkey chased every monkey\" is false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n4.  **A monkey chased a monkey.**\n    *   The rule states: \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one monkey, let's call it M1.\n    *   According to the rule, M1 chased some monkey M2 (which could be M1 itself).\n    *   So, M1 chased M2. This directly implies that \"A monkey chased a monkey.\"\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n5.  **No monkeys chased a monkey.**\n    *   This is the direct opposite of statement 4.\n    *   Since statement 4 must be true, this statement **must be false**.\n\n6.  **A monkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one monkey (M_super) such that M_super chased every other monkey (and itself).\n    *   This is the negation of statement 1. If statement 1 is \"No monkeys chased every monkey,\" then its negation is \"A monkey chased every monkey.\"\n    *   As we determined for statement 1, it is not necessarily true. Therefore, its negation (statement 6) is also **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the rule \"Every monkey chased a monkey that chased it,\" only statement 4 is a direct and necessary consequence.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

Every donkey chased Hazel.**\n\n*   We know: \"Every donkey chased every human.\"\n*   We also know: \"Hazel is a human.\"\n*   Since Hazel is a human, and every donkey chased *every* human, it logically follows that every donkey chased Hazel.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**3.

No donkeys chased Hazel.**\n\n*   From our analysis of statement 2, we concluded that \"Every donkey chased Hazel\" must be true.\n*   If \"Every donkey chased Hazel\" is true, then \"No donkeys chased Hazel\" must be false.\n*   Therefore, this statement **cannot be true**.\n\n**5.

(This is a strong statement).\n4.  **Monkey-Human Action 1:** A monkey kicked Hazel (MHkH) OR a human kicked Lewis (HkL).\n5.  **Monkey Attack Condition 1:** A monkey will attack (MA) UNLESS not all monkeys saw Hazel (\u00ac\u2200MSH). This means: MA $\\iff$ \u2200MSH.\n6.  **Donkey Attack Condition:** Every donkey will attack (DA) UNLESS not all monkeys saw Hazel (\u00ac\u2200MSH). This means: DA $\\iff$ \u2200MSH.\n7.  **Human Chasing Condition:** If no humans chased Hazel (\u00ac\u2203HCH), then not all humans chased Lewis (\u00ac\u2200HCL).\n\n**Analysis of Given Information:**\n\n*   **From (3): \"Every donkey chased every human.\"**\n    *   This means for any donkey 'd' and any human 'h', 'd' chased 'h'.\n    *   This implies that *all* donkeys chased *all* humans.\n\n*   **From (5) and (6):**\n    *   MA $\\iff$ \u2200MSH\n    *   DA $\\iff$ \u2200MSH\n    *   This means MA $\\iff$ DA.

No donkeys chased a human.**\n    *   This directly contradicts given information (3): \"Every donkey chased every human.\"\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 is **False**.\n\n**2. There is a donkey that every human chased.**\n    *   From given information (3): \"Every donkey chased every human.\"\n    *   Let 'd' be any donkey (we know at least one exists).\n    *   Let 'h' be any human (we know at least one exists).\n    *   According to (3), 'd' chased 'h'. This holds for *all* humans.\n    *   So, if you pick *any* donkey, that donkey chased *every* human.\n    *   Since there is at least one donkey, there is indeed a donkey (in fact, every donkey) that every human chased.\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 **must be true**.\n\n**3. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n    *   This statement is a logical contradiction: \"Not P AND P\".\n    *   \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" (\u00ac\u2200MKL) and \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" (\u2200MKL).\n    *   A statement of the form \"X and not X\" is always false.\n    *   Therefore, statement 3 **cannot be true**.\n\n**4. Every donkey chased a human.**\n    *   From given information (3): \"Every donkey chased every human.\"\n    *   This implies that for any donkey, it chased *at least one* human (in fact, it chased *every* human).\n    *   Since there is at least one human, every donkey must have chased a human.\n    *   Therefore, statement 4 **must be true**.\n\n**5. Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, this is a logical contradiction: \"Not P AND P\".\n    *   \"Not all donkeys will run\" (\u00ac\u2200DR) and \"every donkey will run\" (\u2200DR).\n    *   A statement of the form \"X and not X\" is always false.\n    *   Therefore, statement 5 **cannot be true**.\n\n**6. No donkeys chased every human.**\n    *   This directly contradicts given information (3): \"Every donkey chased every human.\"\n    *   If every donkey chased every human, then it's certainly true that *some* donkeys (in fact, all of them) chased every human.\n    *   Therefore, statement 6 is **False**.\n\n**Summary of Must-Be-True Statements:**\n\n*   Statement 2: There is a donkey that every human chased. (True, because *every* donkey chased *every* human).\n*   Statement 4: Every donkey chased a human. (True, because *every* donkey chased *every* human).\n\nThe other conditions (4, 5, 6, 7) and the existence of monkeys and humans are not needed to evaluate statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, as these statements primarily revolve around the \"Every donkey chased every human\" rule and basic logic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2, 4}$",

Symbolically: $\\forall x (R(x) \\implies H(x))$.\n    *   If \"No humans will run\" is true, then nothing runs ($\\forall x \\neg R(x)$).\n    *   If nothing runs, then it's vacuously true that \"Only humans will run\" (because there are no runners to contradict the condition).\n    *   So, \"Only humans will run\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, the conjunction \"Only humans will run AND no humans will run\" is true.\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n3.  **Only humans will run and not all humans will run.**\n    *   We established that \"Only humans will run\" is true (because nothing runs).\n    *   \"Not all humans will run\" means there exists at least one human who will not run. Symbolically: $\\exists x (H(x) \\land \\neg R(x))$.\n    *   Since \"No humans will run\" is given, it means *every* human will not run. If every human will not run, then it's certainly true that at least one human will not run.\n    *   So, \"Not all humans will run\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, the conjunction \"Only humans will run AND not all humans will run\" is true.\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n4.  **Not all humans will run.**\n    *   As explained in point 3, \"No humans will run\" implies that every human will not run. If every human will not run, then it is necessarily true that not all humans will run (because there isn't a single human who *will* run).\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n5.  **Only humans will run.**\n    *   As explained in point 2, since \"No humans will run\" implies that nothing runs, it is vacuously true that \"Only humans will run\" (because there are no non-humans running, nor are there any humans running, so the condition \"if x runs, then x is human\" holds).\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n6.  **Every human will run.**\n    *   This statement directly contradicts the given information \"No humans will run.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Summary of Must Be True Statements:**\n\n*   2. Only humans will run and no humans will run.\n*   3. Only humans will run and not all humans will run.\n*   4. Not all humans will run.\n*   5. Only humans will run.\n\nThe question asks \"Which, if any, of the following statements must be true in this situation?\". It implies selecting all that apply.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2, 3, 4, 5}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and the statements to determine which must be true.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n*   **Premise 1:** Everything is a donkey (D), or a human (H), or a monkey (M) (exclusively). There's at least one of each.\n*   **Premise 2:** If Alfred didn't kick Hazel (\u00acK), then Alfred is asleep (A). (\u00acK \u2192 A)\n*   **Premise 3:** Hazel isn't a human (\u00acH) if and only if Alfred didn't chase Hazel (\u00acC). (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acC)\n*   **Premise 4:** Alfred didn't chase Hazel (\u00acC) if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred (\u00acDA). (\u00acC \u2194 \u00acDA)\n\n**Analyzing the Premises:**\n\nFrom Premise 3 and Premise 4, we can establish a chain of equivalences:\n\n*   (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acC)  (Premise 3)\n*   (\u00acC \u2194 \u00acDA) (Premise 4)\n\nTherefore, by transitivity of equivalence:\n*   (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acDA)\n\nThis means: \"Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's check each statement against our derived information.\n\n1.  **Hazel isn't a human just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n    *   \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if\".\n    *   \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is equivalent to \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" if we assume \"donkeys\" refers to the set of all donkeys. However, \"not all\" means \"at least one did not\", while \"no\" means \"zero did\". These are different.\n    *   Let's re-read Premise 4 carefully: \"Alfred didn't chase Hazel if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.\" This uses \"no donkeys\".\n    *   So, the statement is: (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acDA).\n    *   This is exactly what we derived from the premises. **This statement must be true.**\n\n2.  **Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n    *   This is (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acDA).\n    *   As established above, this is directly derived from Premise 3 and Premise 4. **This statement must be true.**\n\n3.  **Not all donkeys chased Alfred if and only if every human chased Hazel.**\n    *   We've already established that \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is not necessarily equivalent to \"no donkeys chased Alfred\".\n    *   Even if we interpret \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" as \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" (\u00acDA), the statement becomes (\u00acDA \u2194 Every human chased Hazel).\n    *   We have no information in the premises that links \"every human chased Hazel\" to any of the other conditions. Therefore, we cannot confirm this statement. **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n4.  **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n    *   We know (\u00acK \u2192 A). This means if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then Alfred is asleep. We don't know if Alfred kicked Hazel or not. So, we cannot definitively say Alfred is asleep.\n    *   We have no information about Hazel being asleep. **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n5.  **Alfred is asleep.**\n    *   As explained for statement 4, we only know (\u00acK \u2192 A). We don't know if \u00acK is true. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Alfred is asleep. **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n6.  **No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if every human chased Hazel.**\n    *   This is (\u00acDA \u2194 Every human chased Hazel).\n    *   Similar to statement 3, we have no information linking \"every human chased Hazel\" to \"no donkeys chased Alfred\". **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are essentially the same, assuming \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" in statement 1 is interpreted as \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" based on the wording of Premise 4. If \"not all\" is strictly interpreted as \"at least one did not\", then statement 1 is not necessarily true, while statement 2 is. However, in logical reasoning problems, sometimes \"no X did Y\" and \"not all X did Y\" can be used in a way that implies equivalence in context, especially when one is directly linked to \"no X\" in a premise. Given the direct derivation of (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acDA), statement 2 is unequivocally true. Let's re-evaluate statement 1 with strict interpretation.\n\n*   Premise 4: (\u00acC \u2194 \u00acDA) where \u00acDA means \"no donkeys chased Alfred\".\n*   Statement 1: \"Hazel isn't a human just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n    *   This is (\u00acH \u2194 Not all donkeys chased Alfred).\n    *   We know (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acDA).\n    *   Is \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" equivalent to \"no donkeys chased Alfred\"? No. \"Not all\" means \"there exists at least one donkey that did not chase Alfred\". \"No\" means \"for all donkeys, they did not chase Alfred\". These are different.\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 is not necessarily true because of the \"not all\" vs \"no\" distinction.\n\nLet's stick to the precise wording.\n\n*   From Premise 3: (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acC)\n*   From Premise 4: (\u00acC \u2194 \u00acDA)\n*   Combining them: (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acDA)\n\nNow re-evaluate:\n\n1.  **Hazel isn't a human just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n    *   This is (\u00acH \u2194 \u00ac(\u2200d, d chased Alfred)).\n    *   We derived (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acDA), where \u00acDA means (\u2200d, \u00ac(d chased Alfred)).\n    *   These are not the same. \u00ac(\u2200d, d chased Alfred) is equivalent to (\u2203d, \u00ac(d chased Alfred)).\n    *   So, statement 1 is (\u00acH \u2194 \u2203d, \u00ac(d chased Alfred)).\n    *   We know (\u00acH \u2194 \u2200d, \u00ac(d chased Alfred)).\n    *   These are not necessarily equivalent. Therefore, statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **Hazel isn't a human if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n    *   This is (\u00acH \u2194 \u00acDA), where \u00acDA means \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" (i.e., for all donkeys, they did not chase Alfred).\n    *   This is exactly what we derived from the premises. **This statement must be true.**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.** This establishes three distinct categories of beings.\n2.  **No donkeys saw Lewis.** This is a direct and unambiguous statement.\n3.  **A donkey saw a donkey that saw a monkey.** This tells us about a chain of sight involving donkeys and a monkey.\n4.  **Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a monkey chased Hazel.** This is a conditional statement: (Alfred doesn't see Alfred) $\\implies$ (a monkey chased Hazel). Since \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred\" is logically impossible (one always sees oneself, or the statement is nonsensical in this context), the premise is false, making the entire implication true regardless of the consequent. This statement doesn't provide much useful information for our current goal.\n5.  **If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.** This is a complex conditional. \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is logically impossible, so the premise of this main conditional is false. Therefore, the entire statement is true regardless of the consequent. This statement doesn't provide much useful information for our current goal.\n6.  **If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.** Another complex conditional. This statement doesn't provide much useful information for our current goal.\n\n**Focusing on the relevant information for the given options:**\n\nThe most crucial piece of information for evaluating the options is: **\"No donkeys saw Lewis.\"**\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n*   **1. Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n    This directly contradicts \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **2. No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n    We know \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is true from the given information.\n    Does Lewis have to be a non-donkey? If Lewis *were* a donkey, then \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" would still hold true (a donkey cannot see itself in the context of \"donkeys saw Lewis\" meaning other donkeys, or if it means *any* donkey, then Lewis, being a donkey, didn't see himself). However, the statement \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" implies that for any donkey X, X did not see Lewis. This doesn't restrict Lewis's type.\n    Let's re-evaluate. If Lewis *is* a donkey, then \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" means that no donkey (including Lewis himself, if he's a donkey) saw Lewis. This is perfectly consistent.\n    So, \"Lewis isn't a donkey\" is *not* necessarily true. Lewis could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey. The statement \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" only tells us about the donkeys' actions, not Lewis's identity.\n    Therefore, since \"Lewis isn't a donkey\" is not necessarily true, the conjunction \"No donkeys saw Lewis AND Lewis isn't a donkey\" is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **3. Lewis saw every donkey.**\n    The given information \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" tells us about donkeys seeing Lewis, not Lewis seeing donkeys. This statement is not supported or contradicted by the given information. It could be true or false.\n\n*   **4. Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n    We are given \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" This means that for *every* donkey, that donkey did *not* see Lewis. If no donkeys saw Lewis, then it is certainly true that not all donkeys saw Lewis (in fact, zero donkeys saw Lewis). This statement is a logical consequence of \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n*   **5. A donkey saw Lewis.**\n    This directly contradicts \"No donkeys saw Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **6. Lewis saw a donkey.**\n    Similar to statement 3, the given information \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" tells us about donkeys seeing Lewis, not Lewis seeing donkeys. This statement is not supported or contradicted by the given information. It could be true or false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct statement \"No donkeys saw Lewis,\" the only option that must be true is \"Not all donkeys saw Lewis.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and deduce what must be true.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a donkey (D), or a human (H), or a monkey (M) (exclusively).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (D, H, M).\n3.  **Monkeys & Lewis:** Not all monkeys saw Lewis. (This means there's at least one monkey who *didn't* see Lewis).\n4.  **Donkeys & Donkeys:** Every donkey saw every donkey that saw every donkey. (This is a bit of a tongue-twister, let's simplify. If X is a donkey, and Y is a donkey, and Z is a donkey, and Y saw Z, then X saw Y. This implies a transitive-like property for donkeys seeing other donkeys who saw other donkeys. However, the most direct implication is that if a donkey saw *any* donkey, then *every* donkey saw that donkey. More simply, if there's a chain of seeing among donkeys, then all donkeys are involved. The most straightforward interpretation is that if a donkey saw another donkey, then all donkeys saw that donkey. Or, if there's a donkey X that saw a donkey Y, and Y saw a donkey Z, then *every* donkey saw X, Y, and Z. This statement is quite strong. Let's consider the simplest interpretation: if a donkey saw *any* donkey, then *all* donkeys saw *that* donkey. Or, if there's a donkey A that saw a donkey B, and B saw a donkey C, then *every* donkey saw A, B, and C. This is a very strong condition. Let's re-read carefully: \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw every donkey.\" This means for any donkey D1, and any donkey D2, if D2 saw *every* donkey, then D1 saw D2. This is a bit circular. Let's assume a more common interpretation of such phrasing in logic puzzles: if there exists a donkey X such that X saw every donkey, then every donkey saw X. Or, if there's a donkey X that saw a donkey Y, and Y saw a donkey Z, then *every* donkey saw X, Y, and Z.\n    Let's consider the most direct interpretation: For any donkey D1, and any donkey D2, if D2 saw *every* donkey, then D1 saw D2. This is a very specific condition.\n    Let's try another interpretation: For any donkey D1, if D1 saw a donkey D2, and D2 saw a donkey D3, then *every* donkey saw D1, D2, and D3. This seems more plausible for a puzzle.\n    However, the simplest and most direct reading of \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw every donkey\" is:\n    For any donkey D1, and any donkey D2, if D2 saw *every* donkey (i.e., D2 is a donkey that saw all other donkeys, including itself), then D1 saw D2.\n    This implies that if there's a donkey that saw all donkeys, then *all* donkeys saw *that* donkey.\n    This statement is tricky. Let's hold off on strong conclusions from this one unless absolutely necessary, as its precise meaning can be ambiguous.\n    *Self-correction:* A common pattern in these puzzles is that if a statement seems overly complex or recursive, it might imply something simpler or be a distractor, or it might imply a very specific, strong condition. Let's assume the most straightforward interpretation: if a donkey X saw a donkey Y, and Y saw a donkey Z, then *every* donkey saw X, Y, and Z. This implies a very high degree of interconnectedness among donkeys.\n    *Alternative simpler interpretation:* If there is a donkey X that saw *every* donkey, then *every* donkey saw X.\n    *Let's try a different angle:* What if it means \"For every donkey D1, and for every donkey D2, if D2 saw every donkey, then D1 saw D2.\" This means if there's a donkey that saw all donkeys, then all donkeys saw that donkey.\n    *Let's consider the possibility of a tautology or a very strong implication:* If a donkey saw *itself*, then every donkey saw that donkey. This is a common trick.\n    Let's re-evaluate: \"Every donkey saw every donkey that saw every donkey.\"\n    This means: For any donkey X, and any donkey Y, if Y saw *every* donkey (i.e., Y is a donkey that saw all donkeys), then X saw Y.\n    This implies that if there exists a donkey that saw all donkeys, then *all* donkeys saw *that* donkey. This is a strong condition.\n    What if no donkey saw every donkey? Then the \"if\" clause is false, and the statement is vacuously true.\n    This statement is likely designed to be tricky or to imply something about self-seeing.\n    Let's consider the possibility that it implies that if a donkey saw itself, then every donkey saw that donkey.\n    Let's assume for now that this statement is either vacuously true (no donkey saw every donkey) or implies a very specific relationship if such a donkey exists. It doesn't immediately give us information about specific individuals like Hazel or Alfred unless they are donkeys.\n\n5.  **Hazel & Alfred:** Hazel didn't chase Alfred. (HCA is false)\n6.  **Lewis & Hazel:** Lewis doesn't see Hazel. (LSH is false)\n7.  **Hazel & Hazel:** Hazel saw Hazel. (HSH is true)\n8.  **Human & Run:** A human will run. (There exists at least one human who will run).\n9.  **Humans & Monkeys/Lewis:** Every human drank just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.\n    This is a biconditional: (Every human drank) <=> (No monkeys saw Lewis).\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n*   From (3) \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\", we know that there is at least one monkey who *didn't* see Lewis. This means the statement \"All monkeys saw Lewis\" is false.\n*   From (9) \"Every human drank just in case no monkeys saw Lewis\":\n    Let P = \"Every human drank\".\n    Let Q = \"No monkeys saw Lewis\".\n    The statement is P <=> Q.\n    We know from (3) that \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\" is true. This means \"All monkeys saw Lewis\" is false.\n    Does \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\" imply \"No monkeys saw Lewis\"? No.\n    \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\" means $\\exists m \\in M \\text{ s.t. } \\neg (m \\text{ saw Lewis})$.\n    \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" means $\\forall m \\in M, \\neg (m \\text{ saw Lewis})$.\n    So, (3) is $\\neg (\\forall m \\in M, m \\text{ saw Lewis})$.\n    And Q is $\\forall m \\in M, \\neg (m \\text{ saw Lewis})$.\n    Since (3) is true, we know that Q *could* be true, or it could be false (if some monkeys saw Lewis, but not all).\n\n    Let's re-read (3) carefully: \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis.\" This means $\\neg (\\forall x \\in M, x \\text{ saw Lewis})$.\n    This implies $\\exists x \\in M, \\neg (x \\text{ saw Lewis})$.\n\n    Now, let's look at Q: \"No monkeys saw Lewis.\" This means $\\forall x \\in M, \\neg (x \\text{ saw Lewis})$.\n    If Q is true, then (3) is true.\n    If Q is false, then $\\exists x \\in M, x \\text{ saw Lewis}$.\n    But (3) only tells us that *not all* monkeys saw Lewis. It doesn't tell us that *no* monkeys saw Lewis.\n\n    So, we cannot directly determine the truth value of Q from (3).\n    This is a critical point. Let's re-examine.\n\n    \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\" (Given 3)\n    This means: It is NOT the case that (all monkeys saw Lewis).\n    So, (All monkeys saw Lewis) is FALSE.\n\n    Now, consider the biconditional: (Every human drank) <=> (No monkeys saw Lewis).\n    Let's call \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" as statement A.\n    Let's call \"All monkeys saw Lewis\" as statement B.\n    We know $\\neg B$ is true.\n    A is equivalent to $\\neg (\\exists \\text{ monkey who saw Lewis})$.\n    $\\neg B$ is equivalent to $\\exists \\text{ monkey who didn't see Lewis}$.\n\n    These are not the same.\n    Example: If Monkey1 saw Lewis, and Monkey2 didn't see Lewis.\n    Then \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\" is true.\n    But \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" is false.\n\n    So, we cannot determine the truth value of \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" from \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\".\n    This means we cannot determine the truth value of \"Every human drank\".\n\n    This seems like a dead end for this line of reasoning. Let's re-check the problem statement for any subtle phrasing.\n\n    \"Every human drank just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.\"\n    This is a standard biconditional.\n\n    Is there any other way to interpret \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\"?\n    No, it's standard logical negation.\n\n    Let's reconsider the possibility that the problem implies something about the *existence* of Lewis. Lewis is mentioned as someone who is seen or not seen.\n\n    What if \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\" is meant to imply that the condition \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" is relevant?\n\n    Let's assume for a moment that \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\" *implies* \"No monkeys saw Lewis\". This would be a very strong and unusual interpretation. It would mean that if even one monkey didn't see Lewis, then *no* monkeys saw Lewis. This is not standard logic.\n\n    Let's stick to standard logic:\n    (3) $\\neg (\\forall m \\in M, m \\text{ saw Lewis})$ is true.\n    (9) $(\\forall h \\in H, h \\text{ drank}) \\iff (\\forall m \\in M, \\neg (m \\text{ saw Lewis}))$\n\n    We cannot deduce the truth of \"No monkeys saw Lewis\" from \"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\".\n    Therefore, we cannot deduce the truth of \"Every human drank\".\n\n    This means the information about monkeys and humans drinking is not directly giving us a definitive truth value for \"Every human drank\".\n\n    Let's re-evaluate the options. The options are about Hazel and Alfred.\n    We know:\n    *   Hazel didn't chase Alfred (False: HCA)\n    *   Hazel saw Hazel (True: HSH)\n\n    What about Alfred? We don't know anything about Alfred directly, other than he is a donkey, human, or monkey.\n    We don't know if Alfred chased Alfred.\n\n    Let's look at the options again:\n    1.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze each statement.\n\n**Definitions and Given Information:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Donkey (D), Human (H), Monkey (M). These are exclusive.\n*   **Existence:** At least one of each (D, H, M).\n*   **Rule 1 (Human-Human):** Every human saw every human.\n*   **Rule 2 (Donkey-Monkey):** A donkey saw every monkey that saw it.\n*   **Rule 3 (Donkey-Human):** A donkey saw a human that saw a human.\n*   **Rule 4 (Human-Donkey):** Every human saw every donkey that saw every human.\n*   **Rule 5 (Alfred-Lewis):** A human saw Alfred just in case not all humans kicked Lewis.\n\n**Analyzing Rule 1: \"Every human saw every human.\"**\n\nThis is a crucial piece of information.\n\n*   Let H be the set of all humans.\n*   For any h1 in H and any h2 in H, h1 saw h2.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements based on this.\n\n**Statement 1: \"No humans saw every human.\"**\n*   From Rule 1, *every* human saw *every* human. This means that for any human 'x', 'x' saw every human.\n*   Therefore, it is *true* that humans saw every human.\n*   So, \"No humans saw every human\" must be **False**.\n\n**Statement 2: \"No humans saw a human.\"**\n*   From Rule 1, every human saw every human. This implies that every human saw *at least one* human (themselves, or any other human).\n*   Therefore, it is *true* that humans saw a human.\n*   So, \"No humans saw a human\" must be **False**.\n\n**Statement 3: \"Alfred is a donkey.\"**\n*   Rule 5 states: \"A human saw Alfred just in case not all humans kicked Lewis.\"\n*   We know there's at least one human. Let's call this human 'h'.\n*   From Rule 1, 'h' saw every human.\n*   We have no information about Alfred's species, nor about Lewis, nor about kicking. The conditions for a human seeing Alfred are tied to kicking Lewis, not Alfred's species.\n*   We cannot deduce Alfred's species from the given information. Alfred could be a human, a donkey, a monkey, or something else not covered by the initial categories (though the problem states \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey\"). Even if Alfred must be one of these, we don't have enough information to determine which one.\n*   Therefore, \"Alfred is a donkey\" is **Undetermined / Not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 4: \"There is not a human that every human saw.\"**\n*   From Rule 1, \"Every human saw every human.\"\n*   This means that for any human 'h1', 'h1' saw *all* humans.\n*   Consider any human 'h_x'. Did every human see 'h_x'? Yes, because every human saw *every* human.\n*   So, *every* human is a human that every human saw. Since we know there's at least one human, there is *at least one* human that every human saw.\n*   Therefore, \"There is a human that every human saw\" is true.\n*   So, \"There is not a human that every human saw\" must be **False**.\n\n**Statement 5: \"A human saw every human.\"**\n*   From Rule 1, \"Every human saw every human.\"\n*   This directly implies that *at least one* human (in fact, *all* humans) saw every human.\n*   Therefore, \"A human saw every human\" must be **True**.\n\n**Statement 6: \"No humans saw a human that saw it.\"**\n*   From Rule 1, \"Every human saw every human.\"\n*   Let 'h' be any human. 'h' saw 'h' (itself).\n*   And 'h' saw 'h' (itself) means 'h' is a human that saw 'h'.\n*   So, 'h' saw a human ('h') that saw 'h'.\n*   Since this applies to *every* human, it is true that humans saw a human that saw it.\n*   Therefore, \"No humans saw a human that saw it\" must be **False**.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\n1.  No humans saw every human. (False)\n2.  No humans saw a human. (False)\n3.  Alfred is a donkey. (Undetermined)\n4.  There is not a human that every human saw. (False)\n5.  A human saw every human. (True)\n6.  No humans saw a human that saw it. (False)\n\nThe only statement that must be true is Statement 5. The other rules (Donkey-Monkey, Donkey-Human, Human-Donkey, Alfred-Lewis) and the existence of other species do not contradict or alter the direct implications of \"Every human saw every human.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

No donkeys saw Hazel. (This means for every donkey X, X did NOT see Hazel).\n7.  It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel. (This means Lewis DOES see Hazel).\n\n**Analysis of Key Information:**\n\n*   From (3): \"Alfred saw every donkey.\" This is a direct and strong statement.\n*   From (6): \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" This is also a direct and strong statement.\n*   Notice that (4) \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is consistent with (6) \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" If no donkeys saw Hazel, then it's certainly true that not all of them did. So (4) doesn't add new, contradictory information.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's use the direct information, especially \"Alfred saw every donkey.\"\n\n*   **Statement 1: Not all donkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   We are told \"Alfred saw every donkey.\" This means *all* donkeys were seen by Alfred.\n    *   Therefore, \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" must be false.\n\n*   **Statement 2: Every donkey saw Alfred.**\n    *   We are told \"Alfred saw every donkey.\" This is precisely what this statement says.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n*   **Statement 3: No donkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   We are told \"Alfred saw every donkey.\" This means *all* donkeys saw Alfred (or rather, were seen by Alfred).\n    *   If \"Alfred saw every donkey,\" then it's impossible that \"No donkeys saw Alfred.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **Statement 4: A donkey saw Alfred.**\n    *   Since \"Alfred saw every donkey,\" and we know there's at least one donkey (from point 2 of the given information: \"there's at least one of each\"), it logically follows that at least one donkey was seen by Alfred.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n*   **Statement 5: Alfred saw a donkey.**\n    *   We are directly told \"Alfred saw every donkey.\" If Alfred saw *every* donkey, then Alfred certainly saw *a* donkey (since we know there's at least one donkey).\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n*   **Statement 6: Alfred is a donkey.**\n    *   The information states \"Alfred saw every donkey.\" This tells us about Alfred's action (seeing donkeys), but it does not tell us what Alfred *is*. Alfred could be a human, a monkey, or even a donkey. The problem doesn't provide any information to determine Alfred's species.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information provided, especially \"Alfred saw every donkey\" and \"there's at least one of each\" (implying there are donkeys), we can definitively conclude the truth of certain statements.\n\nThe statements that must be true are:\n2.

This part is true.\n*   \"no humans will attack\" contradicts (8) \"A human will attack\".\n*   **Conclusion for 4: False.**\n\n**Statement 5: Lewis won't attack.**\n\n*   This is the opposite of Statement 1.\n*   Since we know \"A human will attack\" (8) and Lewis is a human (3), it's possible Lewis is *the* human who attacks.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lewis *won't* attack.\n*   **Conclusion for 5: Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Statement 6: Only humans are hungry and a human will attack.**\n\n*   \"Only humans are hungry\" is directly given in (4). This part is true.\n*   \"a human will attack\" is directly given in (8). This part is true.\n*   Since both conjuncts are true based on the given information, the entire statement must be true.\n*   **Conclusion for 6: Must be true.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet's ensure no other deductions change the outcome.\n\n*   The information about \"Lewis chased Lewis\" (7) and \"Donkey happiness\" (6) and \"Hazel saw Hazel\" (5) and \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" (9) are all conditional or negative statements that don't directly force any of the attack or hunger conclusions for Lewis or Hazel. For example, we don't know if Lewis chased Lewis, so (7) doesn't activate. We don't know if every human saw Hazel, so (6) doesn't activate.\n*   The core of the problem revolves around statements (3), (4), and (8).\n\n    *   (3) Lewis is a human.\n    *   (4) Only humans are hungry.\n    *   (8) A human will attack.\n\n    Statement 6 combines (4) and (8) directly.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

If $C(m_2, m_1)$, then $C(m_1, m_2)$.\n*   **Happiness:** A human is happy and a monkey is happy. (This information seems irrelevant to the chasing statements).\n*   **Specific Events:** Hazel saw Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred. (This information also seems irrelevant to the chasing statements).\n\n**Analyzing the Monkey Chasing Rule:**\n\n\"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\n\nLet $M$ be the set of all monkeys.\nFor any $m_i \\in M$: If there exists $m_j \\in M$ such that $C(m_j, m_i)$, then for all $m_k \\in M$ such that $C(m_k, m_i)$, it must be that $C(m_i, m_k)$.\n\nThis rule implies a specific property for the \"chased\" relationship *among monkeys*.\nIf monkey A chased monkey B ($C(A, B)$), then monkey B chased monkey A ($C(B, A)$).\nThis means the \"chased\" relationship *among monkeys* is symmetric.\n\nLet's consider the implications of this symmetry:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: No monkey chased any other monkey.**\n    *   In this case, the premise \"a monkey that chased it\" is never met. The rule holds vacuously.\n    *   Example: $M = \\{m_1, m_2\\}$. No $C(m_i, m_j)$ exists.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: At least one monkey chased another monkey.**\n    *   Suppose $C(m_A, m_B)$ exists for $m_A, m_B \\in M$.\n    *   Then, according to the rule applied to $m_B$: $m_B$ was chased by $m_A$. Therefore, $m_B$ must have chased $m_A$. So, $C(m_B, m_A)$.\n    *   This confirms the symmetry: if $C(x, y)$ then $C(y, x)$ for monkeys $x, y$.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the statements based on the derived symmetry.\n\n1.  **Every monkey chased a monkey.**\n    *   This means for every monkey $m_i$, there exists some monkey $m_j$ such that $C(m_i, m_j)$.\n    *   Consider Scenario 1: If no monkey chased any other monkey, then this statement is false. The rule \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it\" would still be true (vacuously).\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means for every monkey $m_i$, it is NOT true that $m_i$ chased every other monkey. In other words, for every $m_i$, there exists some $m_j$ such that $m_i$ did not chase $m_j$.\n    *   Consider a scenario with only one monkey, $m_1$. There are no other monkeys for $m_1$ to chase. So $m_1$ vacuously chased \"every monkey\" (itself, and no others). In this case, \"No monkeys chased every monkey\" would be false. However, the problem states \"there's at least one of each\" (donkey, human, monkey), but it doesn't specify the *number* of monkeys. If there's only one monkey, $m_1$, then $m_1$ chased \"every monkey\" (which is just $m_1$ itself, if we interpret \"every monkey\" to include itself, or vacuously true if it means \"every *other* monkey\").\n    *   Let's assume \"every monkey\" means every monkey in the set $M$.\n    *   If there is only one monkey, $m_1$, then $m_1$ chased \"every monkey\" (i.e., $m_1$ chased $m_1$). The rule \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it\" would mean if $m_1$ chased $m_1$, then $m_1$ chased $m_1$. This is consistent. In this case, \"No monkeys chased every monkey\" would be false.\n    *   If there are multiple monkeys, say $m_1, m_2$.\n        *   If $m_1$ chased $m_2$, then $m_2$ chased $m_1$.\n        *   If $m_1$ chased $m_1$, the rule holds.\n        *   It's possible that $m_1$ chased $m_2$ and $m_2$ chased $m_1$, but $m_1$ did *not* chase $m_3$ (if $m_3$ exists).\n        *   It's also possible that *every* monkey chased *every* other monkey (and themselves). In this case, the rule \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it\" would hold (because if $m_j$ chased $m_i$, then $m_i$ chased $m_j$ is true). If this scenario is possible, then \"No monkeys chased every monkey\" would be false.\n    *   Since a scenario where every monkey chased every monkey is consistent with the rule, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Every monkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means for every monkey $m_i$ and every monkey $m_j$, $C(m_i, m_j)$ is true.\n    *   Consider Scenario 1: If no monkey chased any other monkey, then this statement is false. The rule \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it\" would still be true (vacuously).\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **A monkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one monkey $m_i$ such that for every monkey $m_j$, $C(m_i, m_j)$ is true.\n    *   Again, consider Scenario 1: If no monkey chased any other monkey, then this statement is false. The rule \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it\" would still be true (vacuously).\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **A monkey chased a monkey.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one monkey $m_i$ and at least one monkey $m_j$ such that $C(m_i, m_j)$ is true.\n    *   Consider Scenario 1: If no monkey chased any other monkey, then this statement is false. The rule \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it\" would still be true (vacuously).\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.**\n    *   This statement is a direct rephrasing of the given rule, but with \"A monkey\" instead of \"Every monkey\".\n    *   The original rule is: \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\n    *   This means: For *all* monkeys $m_i$, ($m_i$ chased every monkey that chased $m_i$).\n    *   If this is true for *all* monkeys, then it must be true for *at least one* monkey.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nLet's double-check the interpretation of the rule.\n\"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\"\nLet $P(x)$ be the property \"x chased every monkey that chased x\".\nThe rule states: $\\forall m \\in M, P(m)$.\nStatement 6 states: $\\exists m \\in M, P(m)$.\nIf $\\forall m \\in M, P(m)$ is true, then $\\exists m \\in M, P(m)$ must also be true (since we know there is at least one monkey).\n\nFinal check on the other statements:\nAll statements 1-5 describe a specific state of affairs regarding chasing (e.g., everyone chased someone, no one chased everyone, everyone chased everyone, someone chased everyone, someone chased someone). The given rule only describes a *conditional* property of the chasing relationship (symmetry if a chase occurs). It does *not* mandate that any chasing must occur. If no chasing occurs at all, the rule is vacuously true, and statements 1-5 would all be false. Therefore, none of 1-5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

(This is a crucial negative statement).\n4.  **Humans & Monkeys (Kicking):** Every human kicked every monkey that kicked it.\n5.  **Humans & Hazel (Seeing):** Every human saw Hazel OR every donkey kicked Lewis.\n6.  **Monkeys & Lewis (Seeing) / Donkeys & Hazel (Kicking) / Alfred (Seeing):** If every monkey saw Lewis, then (not all donkeys kicked Hazel ONLY IF Alfred saw Alfred).\n7.  **Attack & Hazel:** A human will attack AND Hazel is a monkey.\n\n**Analysis of Key Information:**\n\n*   **Statement 3: \"No humans chased Lewis.\"** This directly tells us that for any human 'h', 'h did not chase Lewis'.\n\n*   **Statement 7: \"A human will attack AND Hazel is a monkey.\"**\n    *   \"Hazel is a monkey\" is a definite fact. This means Hazel belongs to the 'M' category.\n    *   \"A human will attack\" is also a definite fact.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\nLet's use the direct implication from \"No humans chased Lewis.\"\n\n*   **Statement 1: Lewis chased a human.**\n    *   The given information states \"No humans chased Lewis.\" This does *not* tell us anything about Lewis chasing humans. Lewis could have chased a human, or not. We cannot confirm this.\n\n*   **Statement 2: A human chased Lewis.**\n    *   The given information states \"No humans chased Lewis.\" This directly contradicts \"A human chased Lewis.\" Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n*   **Statement 3: Lewis chased every human.**\n    *   Similar to statement 1, the given information \"No humans chased Lewis\" does not provide any information about Lewis chasing humans. We cannot confirm this.\n\n*   **Statement 4: Every human chased Lewis.**\n    *   The given information states \"No humans chased Lewis.\" If *no* humans chased Lewis, then it's impossible for *every* human to have chased Lewis. This statement must be **false**.\n\n*   **Statement 5: Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n    *   The given information states \"No humans chased Lewis.\" If *no* humans chased Lewis, then it is certainly true that \"not all humans chased Lewis\" (in fact, zero humans chased Lewis). This statement must be **true**.\n\n*   **Statement 6: Alfred will attack.**\n    *   We know \"A human will attack.\" This tells us *some* human will attack, but it doesn't specify *which* human. Alfred could be a human, a donkey, or a monkey. Even if Alfred is a human, we don't know if Alfred is *the* human who will attack. We cannot confirm this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct and unambiguous statement \"No humans chased Lewis,\" we can definitively conclude that \"Not all humans chased Lewis\" must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

Therefore, we cannot determine its truth value based on the provided facts.\n\n**Statement 3: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.**\n*   \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\": This is equivalent to \"Some donkeys did not see Hazel.\" Since \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" is true, it implies that *all* donkeys did not see Hazel, which in turn implies that *not all* donkeys saw Hazel. So, this part is true.\n*   \"it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred\": This means \"Alfred chased Alfred.\" We have no information about Alfred chasing himself. This part is unknown.\n*   Since the second part is unknown, the entire conjunction cannot be determined as true.\n\n**Statement 4: Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n*   \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred\": This is a direct fact from the given information. (True)\n*   \"no donkeys saw Hazel\": This is a direct fact from the given information.

(This is a crucial negative statement).\n*   A human chased Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel. (This is a conditional statement).\n\n**Analyzing the Crucial Negative Statement:**\n\n\"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\nThis means: For any donkey 'd' and any monkey 'm', 'd' did not kick 'm'.\nSymbolically: \u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200m \u2208 M, \u00ac(d kicked m).\n\n**Evaluating Each Statement:**\n\n**1. A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n*   This statement claims: \u2203d \u2208 D, \u2203m \u2208 M such that d kicked m.\n*   This directly contradicts the given information \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 1 **must be false**.\n\n**2. A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n*   This statement claims: \u2203d \u2208 D such that \u2200m \u2208 M, d kicked m.\n*   If there exists such a donkey 'd', then 'd' kicked at least one monkey (in fact, all of them).\n*   This also directly contradicts the given information \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 2 **must be false**.\n\n**3. Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n*   This statement claims: \u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200m \u2208 M, d kicked m.\n*   This is an even stronger contradiction to \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 3 **must be false**.\n\n**4. There is not a monkey that every donkey kicked.**\n*   This statement claims: \u00ac(\u2203m \u2208 M such that \u2200d \u2208 D, d kicked m).\n*   This is equivalent to: \u2200m \u2208 M, \u00ac(\u2200d \u2208 D, d kicked m).\n*   This is also equivalent to: \u2200m \u2208 M, \u2203d \u2208 D such that \u00ac(d kicked m).\n*   From the given \"No donkeys kicked a monkey,\" we know that for *any* donkey 'd' and *any* monkey 'm', 'd' did not kick 'm'.\n*   This implies that for any monkey 'm', it's true that no donkey kicked 'm'.\n*   So, it's certainly true that there isn't a monkey that *every* donkey kicked (because no donkey kicked *any* monkey).\n*   Therefore, statement 4 **must be true**.\n\n**5. Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n*   Let P be the proposition \"Every human is asleep.\"\n*   Let Q be the proposition \"Not all humans are asleep.\" (This is equivalent to \"There is at least one human who is not asleep.\")\n*   The statement is \"P if and only if Q\" (P \u2194 Q).\n*   This means (P \u2192 Q) AND (Q \u2192 P).\n*   Consider the truth values:\n    *   If P is true (every human is asleep), then Q must be false (it's not true that not all humans are asleep). So, P \u2194 Q would be True \u2194 False, which is False.\n    *   If P is false (not every human is asleep, i.e., at least one human is not asleep), then Q must be true (not all humans are asleep). So, P \u2194 Q would be False \u2194 True, which is False.\n*   In both possible scenarios for the state of humans being asleep, the statement \"P \u2194 Q\" evaluates to False.\n*   Therefore, statement 5 **must be false**. (This is a classic logical paradox, similar to \"This statement is false.\")\n\n**6. Every donkey kicked a monkey.**\n*   This statement claims: \u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203m \u2208 M such that d kicked m.\n*   This means that for every donkey, there's at least one monkey it kicked.\n*   This directly contradicts the given information \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 6 **must be false**.\n\n**Regarding the conditional statement:** \"A human chased Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\"\n*   Let C be \"A human chased Hazel.\"\n*   Let S be \"Every donkey saw Hazel.\"\n*   The statement is C \u2192 S.\n*   This means if C is true, then S must be true. If S is false, then C must be false.\n*   This statement does not provide enough information to determine the truth value of C or S, or any of the other statements. It simply establishes a relationship between them. For example, if no human chased Hazel, the statement C \u2192 S is true regardless of whether every donkey saw Hazel. This conditional statement does not force any of the other statements to be true or false.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(M -> Ate)\n4.  **Monkey Action 2:** No monkeys saw a monkey that saw it. (This implies that if Monkey A saw Monkey B, then Monkey B did *not* see Monkey A.

Since Lewis is either a donkey or a human, we cannot deduce anything about Lewis's hunger.\n\nLet's check each statement:\n\n1.  **Lewis is hungry.**\n    *   We know Lewis isn't a monkey. We have no information about whether donkeys or humans can be hungry, or if Lewis specifically is hungry. So, this doesn't *must* be true.\n\n2.  **Lewis isn't hungry.**\n    *   Similar to above, we have no information to confirm or deny Lewis's hunger. So, this doesn't *must* be true.\n\n3.  **Lewis is a monkey.**\n    *   As derived above, if Lewis were a monkey, Lewis would have eaten. But Lewis did not eat. Therefore, Lewis cannot be a monkey. So, this is *false*.\n\n4.  **Lewis ate.**\n    *   This directly contradicts the given information \"it is not the case that Lewis ate.\" So, this is *false*.\n\n5.  **Lewis isn't a monkey.**\n    *   As derived above:\n        *   Premise: Every monkey ate.

A human will attack (HA).\n2.  It is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep (\u00ac(\u00acAS)). This simplifies to **Alfred is asleep (AS)**.\n\nSince Alfred is asleep (AS), and \"A human is asleep (HS) if and only if no donkeys will attack (NDA)\", we can infer:\n3.  **No donkeys will attack (NDA)**.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. Alfred will attack.**\n    *   We know \"A human will attack (HA)\". This means *some* human will attack.\n    *   We also know \"Alfred is asleep (AS)\".\n    *   The statement \"A human will attack but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep\" implies that the human who will attack *is* Alfred, because it links the attack directly to Alfred's sleep status. If it were just *some* human attacking and Alfred being asleep, the phrasing would be different. The structure \"A human will attack but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep\" strongly suggests that Alfred is the human in question who will attack.\n    *   Therefore, **Alfred will attack (AA)**.\n    *   This statement must be true.\n\n**2. Alfred drank.**\n    *   We know \"Every monkey drank (MD)\".\n    *   We don't know if Alfred is a monkey.\n    *   We know Alfred is a human (because \"A human will attack\" and \"Alfred is asleep\" are linked, implying Alfred is the human).\n    *   There's no information about humans drinking.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. A human will attack and every monkey drank.**\n    *   We deduced \"A human will attack (HA)\" from the given information.\n    *   We are directly given \"Every monkey drank (MD)\".\n    *   Both parts are true.\n    *   This statement must be true.\n\n**4. Alfred didn't drink.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about humans drinking or not drinking.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. Alfred won't attack.**\n    *   This contradicts statement 1, which we deduced must be true.\n    *   This statement must be false.\n\n**6. Every monkey drank and no humans will attack.**\n    *   We know \"Every monkey drank (MD)\" is true.\n    *   We deduced \"A human will attack (HA)\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, \"no humans will attack\" is false.\n    *   Since one part of the conjunction is false, the entire statement is false.\n    *   This statement must be false.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   Alfred is a human (from \"A human will attack but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep\").\n*   Alfred is asleep (AS).\n*   Since Alfred is asleep, and \"A human is asleep (HS) if and only if no donkeys will attack (NDA)\", then No Donkeys Will Attack (NDA).\n*   The phrase \"A human will attack but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep\" implies that Alfred is the human who will attack. So, Alfred Will Attack (AA).\n*   We are given \"Every monkey drank (MD)\".\n\nBased on this:\n1.  Alfred will attack. (True)\n2.  Alfred drank. (Unknown)\n3.  A human will attack and every monkey drank. (True, as Alfred is a human who will attack, and every monkey drank)\n4.  Alfred didn't drink. (Unknown)\n5.  Alfred won't attack. (False)\n6.  Every monkey drank and no humans will attack. (False, because humans *will* attack)\n\nThe statements that must be true are 1 and 3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1, 3}$",

(This is a crucial negative statement).\n4.  **Rule 2 (Monkey-Monkey-Donkey Kick):** A monkey kicked a monkey that kicked a donkey.\n5.  **Rule 3 (Donkey-Alfred Kick/Hazel-Alfred See):** No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Hazel doesn't see Alfred. (This is a conditional: If a donkey kicked Alfred, then Hazel doesn't see Alfred).\n6.  **Rule 4 (Monkey-Lewis Chase/Monkey-Hazel Chase):** If every monkey chased Lewis, then a monkey chased Hazel.\n7.  **Rule 5 (Monkey-Lewis See/Donkey-Alfred Kick/Alfred-Hazel Kick):** If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel. (This is complex: If (every monkey saw Lewis), then (if (not all donkeys kicked Alfred), then (Alfred didn't kick Hazel))).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements based on Rule 1:**\n\nRule 1 states: \"No donkeys chased a monkey.\"\n\nLet's rephrase this: For any donkey 'd' and any monkey 'm', 'd' did not chase 'm'.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. A donkey chased a monkey.**\nThis directly contradicts Rule 1 (\"No donkeys chased a monkey\").\nTherefore, statement 1 **must be false**.\n\n**2. There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\nThis means there exists at least one donkey 'd' such that for every monkey 'm', 'd' chased 'm'.\nHowever, Rule 1 states that no donkey chased *any* monkey. If a donkey 'd' chased *every* monkey, it would certainly have chased *a* monkey, which is forbidden by Rule 1.\nTherefore, statement 2 **must be false**.\n\n**3. A donkey chased every monkey.**\nThis means there exists at least one donkey 'd' such that for every monkey 'm', 'd' chased 'm'.\nAgain, this implies that 'd' chased *a* monkey, which is forbidden by Rule 1.\nTherefore, statement 3 **must be false**.\n\n**4. Every donkey chased every monkey.**\nThis means for every donkey 'd' and every monkey 'm', 'd' chased 'm'.\nThis clearly implies that donkeys chased monkeys, which is forbidden by Rule 1.\nTherefore, statement 4 **must be false**.\n\n**5. Every donkey chased a monkey.**\nThis means for every donkey 'd', there exists at least one monkey 'm' such that 'd' chased 'm'.\nThis implies that donkeys chased monkeys, which is forbidden by Rule 1.\nTherefore, statement 5 **must be false**.\n\n**6. No donkeys chased every monkey.**\nLet's analyze this carefully.\nRule 1 states: \"No donkeys chased a monkey.\"\nThis means: For any donkey 'd' and any monkey 'm', 'd' did not chase 'm'.\n\nIf no donkey chased *any* monkey, then it is certainly true that no donkey chased *every* monkey.\nIf a donkey 'd' were to chase *every* monkey, it would imply that 'd' chased *a* monkey (since there's at least one monkey). But we know from Rule 1 that no donkey chased *a* monkey.\nTherefore, it must be true that no donkeys chased every monkey.\n\nLet's put it formally:\nLet P(d, m) be \"donkey d chased monkey m\".\nRule 1: $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, \\neg P(d, m)$.\n\nStatement 6: $\\neg \\exists d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, P(d, m)$. (There is no donkey that chased every monkey)\n\nAssume for contradiction that statement 6 is false.\nThis means: $\\exists d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, P(d, m)$. (There exists a donkey 'd' that chased every monkey).\nIf such a 'd' exists, then for any specific monkey 'm_0' (we know there's at least one monkey), P(d, m_0) must be true.\nBut this contradicts Rule 1, which states $\\neg P(d, m_0)$ for all 'd' and 'm_0'.\nTherefore, our assumption that statement 6 is false must be incorrect.\nHence, statement 6 **must be true**.\n\nThe other rules (2-7) are irrelevant to the evaluation of these specific statements, as they all pertain to the \"chasing\" relationship between donkeys and monkeys, which is fully constrained by Rule 1.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

For example, if D = {d1, d2} and H = {h1, h2}, and d1 kicked h1 and h2, but d2 kicked no one, then statement (1) is true, but statement (2) is false. So, this is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **3. Every donkey kicked every human.**\n    *   Statement (1) says $\\exists d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, k(d, h)$. This is weaker than \"Every donkey kicked every human\" ($\\forall d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, k(d, h)$). So, this is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **4. A donkey kicked a human.**\n    *   From statement (1), we know \"A donkey kicked every human.\" If a donkey kicked *every* human, then it must have kicked *at least one* human (since there's at least one human). Therefore, \"A donkey kicked a human\" must be true.\n\n*   **5. No donkeys kicked every human.**\n    *   This directly contradicts statement (1). Statement (1) explicitly states that \"A donkey kicked every human,\" which means there *is* at least one donkey that kicked every human. So, this is **false**.\n\n*   **6. There is a donkey that every human kicked.**\n    *   Statement (1) is about donkeys kicking humans. This statement is about humans kicking donkeys. There is no information given that links these two actions. So, this is not necessarily true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on the direct implication of statement (1).\n\nStatement (1): \"A donkey kicked every human.\"\nThis means: $\\exists d_0 \\in D$ such that for all $h \\in H$, $k(d_0, h)$.\n\nSince there is at least one human ($H \\neq \\emptyset$), if $d_0$ kicked *every* human, then $d_0$ must have kicked *at least one* human.\nTherefore, there exists a donkey ($d_0$) and there exists a human ($h_0 \\in H$) such that $k(d_0, h_0)$.\nThis is precisely what \"A donkey kicked a human\" means.\n\nThe other two statements (2 and 3) are about Lewis and happiness/sleep, but they don't seem to be needed to evaluate the given options, as option 4 is a direct consequence of statement 1.\n\nFinal check:\nIf \"A donkey kicked every human\" is true, then there exists a donkey, say Donkey A, such that Donkey A kicked Human 1, Donkey A kicked Human 2, ..., Donkey A kicked Human N.\nSince there is at least one human, say Human 1, it follows that Donkey A kicked Human 1.\nTherefore, \"A donkey kicked a human\" is true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 3: \"A donkey chased every monkey.\"\n    *   Since we determined that statement 3 \"A donkey chased every monkey\" cannot be determined to be true, its negation \"No donkeys chased every monkey\" also cannot be determined to be true.

We don't have enough information to confirm this from P1-P7. P7 talks about it as a consequent, but we don't know if the antecedent is true. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **If every donkey saw Hazel, then a donkey kicked Hazel.**\n    *   This is $(\\forall x (Dx \\implies Saw(x, Hazel))) \\implies (\\exists x (Dx \\land Kicked(x, Hazel)))$.\n    *   We know NDKH is true, which means $\\neg (\\exists x (Dx \\land Kicked(x, Hazel)))$.\n    *   So, the consequent \"a donkey kicked Hazel\" is false.\n    *   For an implication $A \\implies B$ to be true when $B$ is false, $A$ must also be false.\n    *   Therefore, if this statement were true, it would imply that \"every donkey saw Hazel\" must be false.\n    *   However, the statement itself is an implication. Since the consequent is false, for the *entire implication* to be true, the antecedent *must* be false.\n    *   Let's rephrase: We know \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true. This means \"A donkey kicked Hazel\" is false.\n    *   So, the statement becomes \"If every donkey saw Hazel, then False\".\n    *   For this implication to be true, \"Every donkey saw Hazel\" must be false.\n    *   This means \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" must be true.\n    *   But the question asks if the *entire statement* \"If every donkey saw Hazel, then a donkey kicked Hazel\" must be true.\n    *   Since \"a donkey kicked Hazel\" is false, the only way for the implication to be true is if \"every donkey saw Hazel\" is also false.\n    *   So, this statement is equivalent to saying \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\". We don't know if this is true.\n    *   Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **No donkeys kicked Hazel and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n    *   This is $NDKH \\land \\neg HSH$.\n    *   We know NDKH is true.\n    *   We know HSH is true (from P3), so $\\neg HSH$ is false.\n    *   Therefore, $True \\land False$ is False. This statement is necessarily false.\n\n4.  **No donkeys kicked Hazel and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   This is $NDKH \\land HSH$.\n    *   We know NDKH is true (from P1).\n    *   We know HSH is true (from P3).\n    *   Therefore, $True \\land True$ is True. This statement must be true.\n\n5.  **No donkeys kicked Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n    *   This is $NDKH \\land NDSH$.\n    *   We know NDKH is true.\n    *   Do we know NDSH (No donkeys saw Hazel)? This is equivalent to $\\neg (\\exists x (Dx \\land Saw(x, Hazel)))$. This is stronger than \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" ($\\neg (\\forall x (Dx \\implies Saw(x, Hazel)))$). We don't have information to confirm this. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **No donkeys kicked Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   This is $NDKH \\land \\neg HSH$.\n    *   This is identical to option 3.\n    *   We know NDKH is true.\n    *   We know HSH is true (from P3), so $\\neg HSH$ is false.\n    *   Therefore, $True \\land False$ is False. This statement is necessarily false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct deductions from the problem statements P1 and P3, only option 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively).** This means these three categories are exhaustive and mutually exclusive.\n2.  **There's at least one of each.** So, there's at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3.  **Lewis will attack.** This is a statement about Lewis's action, but Lewis's species is not specified. It doesn't directly relate to the human-monkey interactions.\n4.  **Every human saw every monkey that saw it.** This is a crucial conditional statement. Let H be the set of humans and M be the set of monkeys. For any human $h \\in H$ and any monkey $m \\in M$: If $m$ saw $h$, then $h$ saw $m$.\n5.  **A human will run.** This tells us there's at least one human, which we already knew from point 2. It doesn't directly relate to the human-monkey interactions.\n6.  **Every human saw Alfred.** This is another crucial piece of information. Alfred is an individual. We don't know Alfred's species.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's denote \"A saw B\" as $S(A, B)$.\n\n**Statement 1: No humans saw every monkey.**\nThis means for every human $h$, there exists at least one monkey $m$ that $h$ did not see.\nWe don't have enough information to confirm or deny this. It's possible some humans saw all monkeys, or none did.\n\n**Statement 2: A human saw every monkey that saw it.**\nThis statement is directly given in the problem description: \"Every human saw every monkey that saw it.\" If \"Every human X\" is true, then \"A human X\" must also be true.\nTherefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 3: Every human saw every monkey.**\nThis means for every human $h$, and for every monkey $m$, $h$ saw $m$.\nLet's consider the implications of \"Every human saw every monkey that saw it.\"\nSuppose there is a human $h_1$ and a monkey $m_1$ such that $h_1$ did *not* see $m_1$.\nDoes this contradict \"Every human saw every monkey that saw it\"? Not necessarily. It only contradicts it if $m_1$ saw $h_1$. If $m_1$ did not see $h_1$, then the condition \"every human saw every monkey that saw it\" is still satisfied for $h_1$ and $m_1$.\nWe cannot conclude that every human saw every monkey. For example, if no monkey saw any human, then the condition \"Every human saw every monkey that saw it\" is vacuously true, but it doesn't mean humans saw monkeys.\n\n**Statement 4: A human saw a monkey.**\nThis means there exists at least one human $h$ and at least one monkey $m$ such that $h$ saw $m$.\nWe know there's at least one human and at least one monkey.\nConsider the possibility that no human saw any monkey. In this case, \"Every human saw every monkey that saw it\" would still be true (vacuously, because the \"that saw it\" part of the condition would never be met).\nSo, we cannot definitively conclude that a human saw a monkey.\n\n**Statement 5: Every human saw a monkey.**\nThis means for every human $h$, there exists at least one monkey $m$ such that $h$ saw $m$.\nSimilar to Statement 4, if no human saw any monkey, this statement would be false, but the given conditions would still hold.\nSo, we cannot definitively conclude this.\n\n**Statement 6: A human saw every monkey.**\nThis means there exists at least one human $h$ such that for every monkey $m$, $h$ saw $m$.\nThis is a stronger claim than \"A human saw a monkey.\" We cannot conclude this from the given information.\n\n**Revisiting the \"Alfred\" clause:**\n\"Every human saw Alfred.\"\nThis tells us something about Alfred. If Alfred is a monkey, then every human saw at least one monkey (Alfred).\nIf Alfred is a monkey, then Statement 4 (\"A human saw a monkey\") would be true.\nIf Alfred is a monkey, then Statement 5 (\"Every human saw a monkey\") would be true.\nHowever, we don't know Alfred's species. Alfred could be a human, a donkey, or even another entity not explicitly categorized (though the problem states \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey\"). Assuming Alfred must be one of the three categories:\n*   If Alfred is a human: This doesn't help with human-monkey interactions.\n*   If Alfred is a donkey: This doesn't help with human-monkey interactions.\n*   If Alfred is a monkey: Then every human saw Alfred (a monkey). This would make statements 4 and 5 true.\n\nSince we are looking for statements that *must* be true, we cannot rely on Alfred being a monkey, as it's not stated.\n\n**Conclusion based on strict logical deduction:**\n\nThe only statement that is directly given or a direct logical consequence of a given statement is Statement 2.\n\nThe statement \"Every human saw every monkey that saw it\" directly implies \"A human saw every monkey that saw it.\" If something is true for \"every X,\" it must be true for \"a X.\"\n\nLet's double-check the other statements.\nCould it be that no human saw any monkey?\nIf no human saw any monkey, then:\n*   \"Every human saw every monkey that saw it\" is true (vacuously, because no monkey saw any human, so the \"that saw it\" condition is never met).\n*   \"A human saw a monkey\" is false.\n*   \"Every human saw a monkey\" is false.\n*   \"A human saw every monkey\" is false.\n*   \"No humans saw every monkey\" could be true or false depending on the specific setup.\n*   \"Every human saw every monkey\" is false.\n\nSince the scenario where no human saw any monkey is consistent with the given information (except for the Alfred part, which we'll address), statements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not necessarily true *unless* Alfred is a monkey.\n\n**What if Alfred is a monkey?**\nIf Alfred is a monkey, then \"Every human saw Alfred\" means \"Every human saw a monkey.\" This would make statement 5 true. And if statement 5 is true, then statement 4 (\"A human saw a monkey\") is also true.\nHowever, the problem does not state Alfred is a monkey. It only states \"Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively)\". So Alfred *must* be one of these.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the impact of \"Every human saw Alfred.\"\nCase 1: Alfred is a human. Then \"Every human saw Alfred\" means every human saw another human (or themselves). This doesn't tell us anything about human-monkey interactions.\nCase 2: Alfred is a donkey. Then \"Every human saw Alfred\" means every human saw a donkey. This doesn't tell us anything about human-monkey interactions.\nCase 3: Alfred is a monkey. Then \"Every human saw Alfred\" means every human saw a monkey. This would make statement 5 true, and consequently statement 4 true.\n\nSince we don't know Alfred's species, we cannot definitively conclude statements 4 or 5 are true. They *might* be true if Alfred is a monkey, but they don't *must* be true.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that *must* be true is the one directly derived from a given premise.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Everything is exclusively a donkey, human, or monkey.\n2.  There's at least one of each (D, H, M are non-empty).\n3.  Lewis (L) doesn't see Alfred (A). (L $\\notin$ sees(A)) - This seems like a distractor, as it doesn't relate to the animal interactions.\n4.

This condition also seems to be a distractor for the donkey/monkey chasing relationships in general.\n\n**Focus on the relevant condition:**\nThe only condition that directly relates to donkeys chasing monkeys (or vice-versa) is condition 4:\n\"Every monkey chased a donkey that chased it.\"\nThis can be rephrased as:\nFor every monkey 'm', there exists a donkey 'd' such that 'm' chased 'd' AND 'd' chased 'm'.\n\nLet's analyze what this implies:\n*   Since there is at least one monkey (M is non-empty), let's pick an arbitrary monkey, say m1.\n*   According to condition 4, m1 chased some donkey d1, and d1 chased m1.\n*   This means that there is at least one donkey (d1) that chased at least one monkey (m1).\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1.  **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means: $\\neg$ ($\\exists$d $\\in$ D, $\\forall$m $\\in$ M, d chased m).\n    *   We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this. Condition 4 only guarantees that for *each* monkey, there's *some* donkey that chased it back.

We know that for every monkey 'm', there exists a donkey 'd' such that 'd' chased 'm'. Since there's at least one monkey, there must be at least one donkey that chased at least one monkey. So, this statement is false.\n\n3.  **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall$d $\\in$ D, $\\forall$m $\\in$ M, d chased m.\n    *   Condition 4 only states that for *each* monkey, *some* donkey chased it back.

This doesn't mean that *every* donkey chased *at least one* monkey. For example, if there's a donkey d2 that wasn't involved in any reciprocal chasing, this statement would be false.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze each statement.\n\n**Definitions and Initial Conditions:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Donkey (D), Human (H), Monkey (M). These are exclusive.\n*   **Existence:** At least one of each (D, H, M) exists.\n*   **Hazel:** A specific individual.\n*   **Alfred:** A specific individual.\n\n**Translating the Given Information into Logical Statements:**\n\n1.  **\"A human saw a monkey that saw a monkey.\"**\n    *   This implies there exists at least one human (H1), at least one monkey (M1), and at least one monkey (M2) such that H1 saw M1, and M1 saw M2. (Note: M1 and M2 could be the same monkey, but the phrasing suggests a chain of sight).\n\n2.  **\"Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\"**\n    *   This is a general principle of sight; one cannot see oneself. This doesn't give us much specific information about Hazel's category yet.\n\n3.  **\"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"**\n    *   For all D, D did not see Hazel. (\u00ac(D sees Hazel))\n\n4.  **\"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless every donkey will attack.\"**\n    *   Let DK = \"Donkeys kicked Alfred\" (meaning at least one donkey kicked Alfred).\n    *   Let EDA = \"Every donkey will attack.\"\n    *   The statement is: \u00acDK unless EDA. This is equivalent to: If DK, then EDA.\n    *   So, DK \u2192 EDA.\n\n5.  **\"Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\"**\n    *   Let HH = \"Hazel is a human.\"\n    *   Let EDS = \"Every donkey saw Hazel.\"\n    *   The statement is: \u00acHH only if EDS. This is equivalent to: If \u00acHH, then EDS.\n    *   So, \u00acHH \u2192 EDS.\n    *   From statement 3, we know \"No donkeys saw Hazel,\" which means EDS is false (\u00acEDS).\n    *   Since \u00acEDS is true, and \u00acHH \u2192 EDS, it must be that \u00ac(\u00acHH) is true.\n    *   Therefore, HH must be true. **Hazel is a human.**\n\n6.  **\"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\"**\n    *   Let NDA = \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" (This means either no donkeys kicked Alfred, or some donkeys kicked Alfred but not all of them).\n    *   Let ASA = \"Alfred saw Alfred.\"\n    *   Let NMKH = \"No monkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n    *   The statement is: NDA \u2192 (ASA only if NMKH).\n    *   This is: NDA \u2192 (ASA \u2192 NMKH).\n    *   From statement 2, we know \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\" Similarly, it's a general principle that one cannot see oneself. So, \"Alfred saw Alfred\" (ASA) must be false (\u00acASA).\n    *   Since \u00acASA is true, the implication (ASA \u2192 NMKH) is true regardless of NMKH's truth value (False implies anything is True).\n    *   Therefore, the entire statement 6 (NDA \u2192 (ASA \u2192 NMKH)) is true regardless of NDA. This statement doesn't give us any new specific information about donkeys, Alfred, or monkeys kicking Hazel.\n\n**Summary of Deductions:**\n\n*   **Hazel is a human.** (From statement 5 and 3)\n*   **No donkeys saw Hazel.** (Given in statement 3)\n*   **Alfred did not see Alfred.** (General principle)\n\n**Analyzing the Options based on Deductions:**\n\nWe know:\n*   Hazel is a human.\n*   No donkeys saw Hazel.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options:\n\n1.  **Every donkey saw a human.**\n    *   This means for every donkey D, there exists a human H such that D saw H.\n    *   We know Hazel is a human. If a donkey saw *any* human, it could be Hazel. But we know \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    *   If every donkey saw *a* human, and Hazel is *a* human, then it's possible that every donkey saw a human *other than* Hazel. This statement is not necessarily true or false based on our information.\n\n2.  **No donkeys saw a human.**\n    *   This means for every donkey D, and for every human H, D did not see H.\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" Since Hazel is a human, this part is consistent.\n    *   However, this statement claims *no* donkey saw *any* human. We only know they didn't see Hazel. They could have seen other humans. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **No donkeys saw every human.**\n    *   This means for every donkey D, it is NOT the case that D saw every human.\n    *   In other words, for every donkey D, there exists at least one human H that D did not see.\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" Since Hazel is a human, for every donkey D, D did not see Hazel.\n    *   This directly implies that for every donkey D, there exists at least one human (namely, Hazel) that D did not see.\n    *   Therefore, **this statement must be true.**\n\n4.  **A donkey saw a human.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one donkey D and at least one human H such that D saw H.\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" So, if a donkey saw a human, it must have been a human other than Hazel.\n    *   We have no information to confirm or deny this. It's not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **Every donkey saw every human.**\n    *   This means for every donkey D, and for every human H, D saw H.\n    *   This contradicts \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" because Hazel is a human.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n6.  **A donkey saw every human.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one donkey D such that for every human H, D saw H.\n    *   This contradicts \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" because Hazel is a human. If a donkey saw every human, it would have to see Hazel.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the deductions, only statement 3 (\"No donkeys saw every human\") must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This is consistent with \"Every monkey saw a human\" (if the human kicked was also seen by *every* monkey, but we only know *a* monkey kicked *a* human).\n\nSuppose Alfred *is not* a human (A \u2260 H).\nThis means Alfred is either a donkey or a monkey.\nIn this case, the condition \"every donkey chased Alfred\" doesn't necessarily have to be true.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the \"Alfred isn't a human unless every donkey chased Alfred\" statement.**\nThis is a conditional: (A = H) => (\u2200D_chased_A).\n\nWe know \"A monkey kicked Alfred.\"\nIf Alfred is a human, then a monkey kicked a human. This is possible.\nIf Alfred is a donkey, then a monkey kicked a donkey. This is possible.\nIf Alfred is a monkey, then a monkey kicked a monkey. This is possible.\n\nThe crucial part is that we *don't know* if Alfred is a human or not.\nIf Alfred *is* a human, then every donkey chased Alfred.\nIf Alfred *is not* a human, then Alfred is a donkey or a monkey.\n\n**Let's analyze the given statements:**\n\n**Statement 1: No humans saw every monkey.**\nThis means for every human H, there is at least one monkey M that H did not see.\nWe know \"Every monkey saw a human.\" This is about monkeys seeing humans, not humans seeing monkeys. This statement is not necessarily true or false based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 2: A monkey saw a human.**\nWe are given: \"Every monkey saw a human.\"\nSince there is at least one monkey, and every monkey saw a human, it *must* be true that at least one monkey saw a human. This statement is a direct consequence of the given information.\n\n**Statement 3: Every human saw a monkey.**\nWe know \"Every monkey saw a human.\" This means for every monkey M, there exists a human H such that M saw H. It does *not* mean that for every human H, there exists a monkey M such that H saw M. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: A human saw every monkey.**\nThis means there exists at least one human H_0 such that H_0 saw every monkey.\nWe know \"Every monkey saw a human.\" This is about monkeys seeing humans. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: Every human saw every monkey.**\nThis means for every human H and every monkey M, H saw M.\nThis is a very strong statement and is not supported by \"Every monkey saw a human.\" This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: A human saw a monkey.**\nThis means there exists at least one human H and at least one monkey M such that H saw M.\nWe know \"Every monkey saw a human.\" This means for every monkey M_i, there is some human H_j that M_i saw. This does not guarantee that any human saw any monkey. For example, if Monkey1 saw HumanA, and Monkey2 saw HumanB, it doesn't mean HumanA saw Monkey1 or HumanB saw Monkey2.\nHowever, let's consider the implications of \"Every monkey saw a human.\"\nLet M be the set of monkeys and H be the set of humans.\nFor every m in M, there exists h in H such that m saw h.\nThis is a one-way relationship. It does not imply the reverse.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Statement 2 and 6 carefully.\n\n**Re-evaluation of Statement 2: A monkey saw a human.**\nGiven: \"Every monkey saw a human.\"\nAnd: \"there's at least one of each [monkey, human, donkey].\"\nSince there is at least one monkey, let's call it Monkey1.\nAccording to the rule, Monkey1 saw a human.\nTherefore, \"A monkey saw a human\" must be true. This is a direct and undeniable consequence.\n\n**Re-evaluation of Statement 6: A human saw a monkey.**\nGiven: \"Every monkey saw a human.\"\nThis means for every monkey M, there exists a human H such that M saw H.\nThis does *not* imply that any human saw any monkey.\nConsider a scenario:\nMonkeys: M1, M2\nHumans: H1, H2\nM1 saw H1.\nM2 saw H2.\nThis satisfies \"Every monkey saw a human.\"\nDoes H1 necessarily see M1? No. Does H2 necessarily see M2? No.\nSo, \"A human saw a monkey\" is not necessarily true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   **Everything is D, H, or M (exclusively). At least one of each.**\n*   **Every monkey saw a human.** (M -> H_seen_by_M)\n*   **Lewis isn't a donkey.** (L is H or M)\n*   **A monkey kicked Alfred.** (M_kicked_A)\n*   **Alfred isn't a human unless every donkey chased Alfred.** (A=H => \u2200D_chased_A)\n\nLet's focus on the statements again.\n\n1.  **No humans saw every monkey.** (Not necessarily true)\n2.  **A monkey saw a human.** (TRUE. Directly from \"Every monkey saw a human\" and \"at least one monkey exists.\")\n3.  **Every human saw a monkey.** (Not necessarily true. The seeing relationship is from monkey to human, not human to monkey.)\n4.  **A human saw every monkey.** (Not necessarily true.)\n5.  **Every human saw every monkey.** (Not necessarily true.)\n6.  **A human saw a monkey.** (Not necessarily true. As shown in the example above, M1 saw H1, M2 saw H2. This doesn't mean H1 saw M1 or H2 saw M2. The act of seeing is directional.)\n\nThe information about Lewis and Alfred doesn't seem to directly impact the truth of these six statements, which primarily revolve around the \"seeing\" relationship between humans and monkeys. The only relevant piece of information for these statements is \"Every monkey saw a human\" and the existence of at least one of each category.\n\nTherefore, only statement 2 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(This is a crucial negative statement)\n*   Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n*   Lewis is happy.\n*   A monkey kicked Hazel only if a monkey saw Alfred. (M_kicked_H -> M_saw_A)\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nThe most important piece of information for evaluating statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 is: **\"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"**\n\nThis means for any donkey 'd' and any monkey 'm', it is *not* true that 'd kicked m'.\n\nLet's rephrase \"No donkeys kicked a monkey\" as:\nFor all 'd' in D and all 'm' in M, d did not kick m.\nOR\nThere does not exist a donkey 'd' and a monkey 'm' such that 'd kicked m'.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. Every donkey kicked a monkey.**\nThis means: For every donkey 'd', there exists a monkey 'm' such that 'd kicked m'.\nThis directly contradicts \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\nTherefore, statement 1 is **False**.\n\n**2. A donkey kicked every monkey.**\nThis means: There exists a donkey 'd' such that for every monkey 'm', 'd kicked m'.\nIf such a donkey 'd' existed, it would have kicked *at least one* monkey (since there's at least one monkey). This contradicts \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\nTherefore, statement 2 is **False**.\n\n**3. Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\nThis means: For every donkey 'd' and every monkey 'm', 'd kicked m'.\nThis directly contradicts \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\nTherefore, statement 3 is **False**.\n\n**4. Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\nLet P be the statement \"Every human is asleep.\"\nLet Q be the statement \"Not all humans are asleep.\"\nThe statement is \"P just in case Q\", which means (P AND Q) OR (NOT P AND NOT Q).\nIf P is true, then \"Every human is asleep.\" This implies Q (\"Not all humans are asleep\") is false. So (P AND NOT Q) would be true.\nIf P is false, then \"Not every human is asleep.\" This implies Q (\"Not all humans are asleep\") is true. So (NOT P AND Q) would be true.\nIn either case, (P AND Q) is false and (NOT P AND NOT Q) is false.\nThis statement is a logical contradiction. If \"Every human is asleep\" is true, then \"Not all humans are asleep\" must be false. If \"Every human is asleep\" is false, then \"Not all humans are asleep\" must be true.\nIt's impossible for P and Q to be true simultaneously, and it's impossible for P and Q to be false simultaneously.\nTherefore, this statement is a logical impossibility and cannot be true.\nTherefore, statement 4 is **False**.\n\n**5. There is not a monkey that every donkey kicked.**\nThis means: It is *not* true that (there exists a monkey 'm' such that every donkey 'd' kicked 'm').\nLet's rephrase the part in parentheses: \"There exists a monkey 'm' such that for every donkey 'd', 'd kicked m'.\"\nDoes this part in parentheses contradict \"No donkeys kicked a monkey\"? Yes. If such a monkey 'm' existed, then at least one donkey (in fact, every donkey) would have kicked it, which violates \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\nSince the part in parentheses is false due to the given information, its negation (\"There is not a monkey that every donkey kicked\") must be true.\nTherefore, statement 5 is **True**.\n\n**6. A donkey kicked a monkey.**\nThis means: There exists a donkey 'd' and a monkey 'm' such that 'd kicked m'.\nThis directly contradicts \"No donkeys kicked a monkey.\"\nTherefore, statement 6 is **False**.\n\n**Summary of Truth Values:**\n1. False\n2. False\n3. False\n4. False\n5. True\n6. False\n\nThe information \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel,\" \"Lewis is happy,\" and \"A monkey kicked Hazel only if a monkey saw Alfred\" are distractors for these specific statements, as they don't impact the truth value of the given options based on the \"No donkeys kicked a monkey\" rule or the logical structure of statement 4.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

So, \"No donkeys kicked Alfred OR not all donkeys will attack.\"\n    *   Let's assume \"attack\" refers to kicking in general. \"Not all donkeys will attack\" could mean \"$\\neg \\forall d \\in D \\exists x : K(d, x)$\" (not every donkey kicks someone) or \"$\\neg \\forall d \\in D \\forall x : K(d, x)$\" (not every donkey kicks everyone).\n    *   Given the context of \"kicked Alfred\", it's highly probable that \"attack\" refers to kicking *someone*.\n    *   Let's try a common interpretation of \"X unless Y\": $\\neg Y \\implies X$.\n        *   So, \"If it is not the case that (not all donkeys will attack), then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n        *   This means: \"If all donkeys will attack, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n        *   This still leaves \"attack\" vague.\n\n    *   Let's consider the possibility that \"attack\" refers to kicking *Alfred*.\n        *   \"No donkeys kicked Alfred unless not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n        *   Let P = \"No donkeys kicked Alfred\" ($\\neg \\exists d \\in D : K(d, A)$).\n        *   Let Q = \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" ($\\neg \\forall d \\in D : K(d, A)$).\n        *   The statement is \"P unless Q\", which is $\\neg Q \\implies P$.\n        *   So, \"If it is not the case that (not all donkeys kicked Alfred), then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n        *   \"If all donkeys kicked Alfred, then no donkeys kicked Alfred.\"\n        *   This implies that it's impossible for all donkeys to kick Alfred. So, $\\neg \\forall d \\in D : K(d, A)$. This means **\"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\"**\n\n    *   Let's go with this interpretation: **$\\neg \\forall d \\in D : K(d, A)$** (Not all donkeys kicked Alfred). This means there is at least one donkey that did not kick Alfred.\n\n3.  **\"If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\"**\n    *   Let P = \"Not all humans are asleep\" ($\\neg \\forall h \\in H : S(h)$).\n    *   Let Q = \"Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" ($\\neg K(A, Z)$).\n    *   Let R = \"Every monkey is hungry\" ($\\forall m \\in M : Hu(m)$).\n    *   The structure is \"If P, then (Q only if R)\".\n    *   \"Q only if R\" is equivalent to \"If Q, then R\".\n    *   So, the statement is: $P \\implies (Q \\implies R)$.\n    *   Substituting: $(\\neg \\forall h \\in H : S(h)) \\implies ((\\neg K(A, Z)) \\implies (\\forall m \\in M : Hu(m)))$.\n\n4.  **\"If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"**\n    *   Let P = \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred\" ($\\neg \\forall d \\in D : K(d, A)$). (This is the conclusion from statement 2).\n    *   Let Q = \"Hazel kicked Hazel\" ($K(Z, Z)$).\n    *   Let R = \"Not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" ($\\neg \\forall d \\in D : K(d, Z)$).\n    *   The structure is \"If P, then (Q only if R)\".\n    *   So, the statement is: $P \\implies (Q \\implies R)$.\n    *   Substituting: $(\\neg \\forall d \\in D : K(d, A)) \\implies (K(Z, Z) \\implies (\\neg \\forall d \\in D : K(d, Z)))$.\n\n5.  **\"Alfred isn't hungry and Lewis is a donkey.\"**\n    *   $\\neg Hu(A)$\n    *   $L \\in D$\n\n**Deductions:**\n\nFrom (2), we deduced:\n*   **D1: $\\neg \\forall d \\in D : K(d, A)$** (Not all donkeys kicked Alfred).\n\nNow, use D1 in (4):\n*   Since the antecedent of (4) is true (D1), the consequent must be true.\n*   So, $K(Z, Z) \\implies (\\neg \\forall d \\in D : K(d, Z))$.\n*   This means: **If Hazel kicked Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n\nLet's re-examine statement (1): **\"There is a monkey that every donkey kicked.\"**\n*   $\\exists m_0 \\in M \\forall d \\in D : K(d, m_0)$\n*   This means there exists at least one specific monkey, let's call it $m_0$, such that every single donkey kicked $m_0$.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n1.  **No donkeys kicked every monkey.**\n    *   This means $\\neg \\exists d \\in D \\forall m \\in M : K(d, m)$.\n    *   This is equivalent to $\\forall d \\in D \\exists m \\in M : \\neg K(d, m)$. (For every donkey, there's some monkey it didn't kick).\n    *   Does our information support this? We know there's a monkey $m_0$ that *every* donkey kicked. This statement says no donkey kicked *every* monkey. These seem contradictory.\n    *   If there is a monkey $m_0$ that every donkey kicked, then for any donkey $d$, $K(d, m_0)$ is true. This doesn't directly tell us if any donkey kicked *every* monkey.\n    *   Let's re-read. \"No donkeys kicked every monkey\" means \"It is not the case that there exists a donkey $d$ such that $d$ kicked every monkey.\"\n    *   From (1), we have $\\exists m_0 \\in M \\forall d \\in D : K(d, m_0)$. This means every donkey kicked *some* monkey ($m_0$).\n    *   This statement (1) does not imply that any donkey kicked *every* monkey.\n    *   Consider a scenario: Donkeys $D_1, D_2$. Monkeys $M_1, M_2$.\n        *   Statement (1): $D_1$ kicked $M_1$, $D_2$ kicked $M_1$. (So $M_1$ is the $m_0$).\n        *   Option 1: \"No donkeys kicked every monkey.\"\n            *   Did $D_1$ kick every monkey? Maybe $D_1$ didn't kick $M_2$.\n            *   Did $D_2$ kick every monkey? Maybe $D_2$ didn't kick $M_2$.\n            *   In this scenario, option 1 could be true.\n    *   Consider another scenario: Donkeys $D_1$. Monkeys $M_1, M_2$.\n        *   Statement (1): $D_1$ kicked $M_1$. (So $M_1$ is the $m_0$).\n        *   If $D_1$ also kicked $M_2$, then $D_1$ kicked every monkey. In this case, option 1 would be false.\n    *   So, statement (1) alone doesn't make option 1 necessarily true.\n\n2.  **Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n    *   $\\forall d \\in D \\forall m \\in M : K(d, m)$.\n    *   From (1), we know $\\exists m_0 \\in M \\forall d \\in D : K(d, m_0)$. This means all donkeys kicked *one specific* monkey. It does not mean they kicked *all* monkeys.\n    *   This is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **No donkeys kicked a monkey.**\n    *   $\\neg \\exists d \\in D \\exists m \\in M : K(d, m)$.\n    *   This is equivalent to $\\forall d \\in D \\forall m \\in M : \\neg K(d, m)$. (No donkey kicked any monkey).\n    *   This directly contradicts statement (1) which says $\\exists m_0 \\in M \\forall d \\in D : K(d, m_0)$. If every donkey kicked $m_0$, then certainly donkeys kicked a monkey.\n    *   So, this is false.\n\n4.  **A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n    *   $\\exists d \\in D \\forall m \\in M : K(d, m)$.\n    *   This is the negation of option 1.\n    *   Does our information imply this? No. Statement (1) says every donkey kicked *a* monkey (the same one). It doesn't say *a* donkey kicked *every* monkey",

Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.**\n    *   This is P \u2227 (A chased A).\n    *   If P is false (all donkeys saw Hazel), then this statement is false. So, this doesn't *must* be true.\n\n**6.

So, this doesn't *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatement 4 is the only one that is directly constructed from two explicitly stated facts in the problem description.\n\n*   \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is given as true in Fact 4.\n*   \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" is equivalent to \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\", which is given as true in Fact 1.\n\nSince both parts of statement 4 are explicitly true based on the problem's given information, statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

It means that for every individual that is a donkey, that individual did not see Hazel.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's go through each statement and see if it *must* be true based on the given information.\n\n*   **Statement 1: Every donkey saw Hazel.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    *   Therefore, Statement 1 **must be false**.\n\n*   **Statement 2: Hazel saw every donkey.**\n    *   The information \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" tells us about the donkeys' action of seeing Hazel. It doesn't tell us anything about Hazel's action of seeing donkeys.\n    *   It's possible Hazel saw every donkey, or some donkeys, or no donkeys. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 2 **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n*   **Statement 3: A donkey saw Hazel.**\n    *   This means \"There exists at least one donkey that saw Hazel.\"\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n    *   Therefore, Statement 3 **must be false**.\n\n*   **Statement 4: Not all donkeys saw Hazel.**\n    *   \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" implies that *zero* donkeys saw Hazel.\n    *   If zero donkeys saw Hazel, then it is certainly true that \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" (because \"all donkeys saw Hazel\" would mean every single one did, which is false).\n    *   Therefore, Statement 4 **must be true**.\n\n*   **Statement 5: Hazel saw a donkey.**\n    *   Similar to Statement 2, this tells us about Hazel's action of seeing. The given information \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" is about the donkeys' action.\n    *   We know there's at least one donkey. It's possible Hazel saw one, or didn't. We don't have enough information.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 5 **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n*   **Statement 6: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel saw Hazel.**\n    *   We've already established that \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" must be true (from Statement 4).\n    *   The second part is \"Hazel saw Hazel.\" We have no information about Hazel seeing herself. This is not implied or contradicted by any of the given premises.\n    *   Since the second part (\"Hazel saw Hazel\") is not necessarily true, the entire conjunction (\"A and B\") is not necessarily true.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 6 **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**Conclusion based on the direct statement \"No donkeys saw Hazel\":**\n\nThe most direct and impactful piece of information is \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\" This statement directly implies that \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n\nThe conditional statement: \"If (not all humans are asleep), then (Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel).\"\nLet P = \"not all humans are asleep\"\nLet Q = \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis\"\nLet R = \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\"\nThe statement is: P -> (Q -> R)\n\nWe have already established that R (\"not all donkeys saw Hazel\") is true based on \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\nIf R is true, then (Q -> R) is true regardless of Q's truth value (because if the consequent of an implication is true, the implication is true).\nTherefore, the entire conditional P -> (Q -> R) is true. This consistency check confirms our understanding, but it doesn't add new information about the truth of R itself, which was already directly given.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is the one directly implied by \"No donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(If *no* donkeys kicked Hazel, then it's certainly true that *not all* donkeys kicked Hazel).\n\nSince R is true, the implication (Q -> R) is true, regardless of Q.

So, this part is not necessarily true.\n5.  **A human is happy and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n    *   \"A human is happy\" is true from (4).\n    *   \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\" is true from (6).\n    *   Both parts of this conjunction are directly stated as true in the problem description.

(D -> M: For every donkey d and every monkey m, d chased m).\n*   **Rule 2:** A monkey chased a human that chased a donkey. (M -> H -> D: There exists a monkey m1, a human h1, and a donkey d1 such that m1 chased h1 and h1 chased d1).\n*   **Rule 3 (Conditional):** If a monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred is asleep. (This rule is about Alfred and Hazel and doesn't directly relate to the chasing relationships between D, H, M, so it's likely a distractor for the core question about chasing).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's use the notation \"X chased Y\" as C(X, Y).\n\n*   **Rule 1 restated:** For all d in D and all m in M, C(d, m).\n\n**Statement 1: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n*   This means: $\\exists d \\in D \\text{ such that } \\forall m \\in M, C(m, d)$.\n*   Our given Rule 1 states that *every donkey chased every monkey*. It does *not* state that *every monkey chased every donkey*.\n*   Consider a scenario: Donkey A chased Monkey X and Monkey Y. Donkey B chased Monkey X and Monkey Y. But Monkey X might not have chased any donkey, and Monkey Y might not have chased any donkey.\n*   The given information only tells us about donkeys chasing monkeys, not monkeys chasing donkeys.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude this. **False.**\n\n**Statement 2: Every monkey chased every donkey.**\n*   This means: $\\forall m \\in M \\text{ and } \\forall d \\in D, C(m, d)$.\n*   Again, the given Rule 1 is \"Every donkey chased every monkey\" (D -> M). This statement is the reverse (M -> D).\n*   We have no information to support monkeys chasing donkeys universally. We only know *a* human chased *a* donkey, and *a* monkey chased *a* human.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude this. **False.**\n\n**Statement 3: No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n*   This means: $\\neg (\\exists d \\in D \\text{ such that } \\forall m \\in M, C(d, m))$.\n*   This is equivalent to: $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists m \\in M \\text{ such that } \\neg C(d, m)$. (For every donkey, there's at least one monkey it *didn't* chase).\n*   However, the given Rule 1 explicitly states: \"Every donkey chased every monkey.\" This means for *every* donkey, it *did* chase *every* monkey.\n*   This statement directly contradicts Rule 1.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false. **False.**\n\n**Statement 4: There is not a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n*   This means: $\\neg (\\exists d \\in D \\text{ such that } \\forall m \\in M, C(m, d))$.\n*   This is the negation of Statement 1.\n*   Since we determined that Statement 1 is not necessarily true (we don't have enough information to confirm it), its negation is also not necessarily true. We simply don't know if such a donkey exists or not.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude this. **False.**\n\n**Statement 5: Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n*   This means: $\\forall d \\in D, \\exists m \\in M \\text{ such that } C(d, m)$.\n*   The given Rule 1 states: \"Every donkey chased every monkey.\"\n*   If every donkey chased *every* monkey, then it logically follows that every donkey chased *at least one* monkey (since we know there's at least one monkey).\n*   This statement is a direct logical consequence of Rule 1 and the existence of monkeys.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true. **True.**\n\n**Statement 6: No donkeys chased a monkey.**\n*   This means: $\\neg (\\exists d \\in D \\text{ such that } \\exists m \\in M, C(d, m))$.\n*   This is equivalent to: $\\forall d \\in D, \\forall m \\in M, \\neg C(d, m)$. (No donkey chased any monkey).\n*   This directly contradicts the given Rule 1: \"Every donkey chased every monkey.\"\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false. **False.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(This is a direct and strong statement).\n4.  **Monkey-Human Chain:** A monkey chased a monkey that chased a human.\n5.  **Donkey-Alfred/Lewis:** If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n6.  **Human-Hazel/Lewis-Hazel Equivalence:** A human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel. (This means: (Human saw Hazel) IFF (Lewis saw Hazel)).\n7.  **Lewis-Donkey/Monkey-Hazel/Human-Hazel Implication:** If Lewis is a donkey, then (every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel). (This means: If Lewis is D, then ( (Every M saw H) => (Every H saw H) ) ).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's use the given information to evaluate each of the options.\n\n**Key Deduction from (3): \"No monkeys chased Hazel.\"**\n\nThis statement is crucial. It directly tells us about the relationship between monkeys and Hazel.\n\n*   If \"No monkeys chased Hazel\" is true, then it means that for any monkey 'x', 'x did not chase Hazel'.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n*   **1. Not all monkeys chased Hazel.**\n    *   If \"No monkeys chased Hazel\" is true, then it implies that *zero* monkeys chased Hazel. If zero monkeys chased Hazel, then it's certainly true that \"not all monkeys chased Hazel\" (because \"all monkeys chased Hazel\" would mean every single one did, which is contradicted by \"no monkeys\").\n    *   **This statement must be true.**\n\n*   **2. Hazel chased every monkey.**\n    *   The given information (3) \"No monkeys chased Hazel\" is about monkeys chasing Hazel, not Hazel chasing monkeys. We have no information about Hazel's actions.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **3. Hazel chased a monkey.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about Hazel's actions.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **4. Every monkey chased Hazel.**\n    *   This directly contradicts given information (3) \"No monkeys chased Hazel.\" If no monkeys chased Hazel, then it's impossible for every monkey to have chased Hazel.\n    *   **This statement must be false.**\n\n*   **5. A monkey chased Hazel.**\n    *   This also directly contradicts given information (3) \"No monkeys chased Hazel.\" If no monkeys chased Hazel, then it's impossible for *a* monkey (meaning at least one) to have chased Hazel.\n    *   **This statement must be false.**\n\n*   **6. Alfred is a donkey.**\n    *   Let's look at information (5): \"If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\"\n    *   We don't know if \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is true or false.\n    *   We don't know if \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is true or false. (Lewis not chasing Lewis is a self-referential statement, often considered true if Lewis exists and is not a self-chaser, but we can't definitively say without more context on \"chasing oneself\").\n    *   We also have no information that links Alfred's species to anything else. Alfred could be a human, a monkey, or a donkey.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct contradiction or implication from the given statement \"No monkeys chased Hazel,\" only one of the options must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This implies a reciprocal kicking relationship: h -> m and m -> h.\n4.  **Lewis/Hazel Condition:** If not all humans are asleep (\u00ac\u2200h(asleep(h))), then Lewis didn't chase Lewis (\u00acchase(Lewis, Lewis)) only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel (\u00ac\u2200d(kicked(d, Hazel))).\n    *   This can be written as: (\u00ac\u2200h(asleep(h))) => (\u00acchase(Lewis, Lewis) <=> \u00ac\u2200d(kicked(d, Hazel)))\n5.  **Running/Hazel State:** Not all humans will run (\u00ac\u2200h(will_run(h))) AND Hazel isn't asleep (\u00acasleep(Hazel)).\n\n**Analysis of the Kicking Rule (Point 3):**\n\n\"Every human kicked a monkey that kicked it.\"\nLet H be the set of humans and M be the set of monkeys.\nFor every h \u2208 H, there exists an m \u2208 M such that:\n(h kicked m) AND (m kicked h).\n\nThis means that for every human, there's at least one monkey they're in a mutual kicking relationship with.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's go through each statement:\n\n**1. A human kicked a monkey.**\n*   From the kicking rule: \"Every human kicked a monkey that kicked it.\"\n*   Since there is at least one human (from point 2), let's call this human 'h1'.\n*   According to the rule, h1 kicked a monkey.\n*   Therefore, \"A human kicked a monkey\" must be true.\n\n**2. A human kicked every monkey.**\n*   The kicking rule states: \"Every human kicked *a* monkey that kicked it.\" It doesn't say *every* monkey.\n*   Consider a scenario: Human H1 kicks Monkey M1. Human H2 kicks Monkey M2. There are no other humans or monkeys.\n*   In this scenario, H1 did not kick M2, and H2 did not kick M1. So, no single human kicked *every* monkey.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. No humans kicked a monkey.**\n*   This directly contradicts the kicking rule: \"Every human kicked a monkey that kicked it.\"\n*   Since there is at least one human, at least one human *did* kick a monkey.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**4. No humans kicked every monkey.**\n*   This is the negation of \"A human kicked every monkey.\"\n*   We determined that \"A human kicked every monkey\" is not necessarily true.\n*   Could it be that *some* human *did* kick every monkey? The rule doesn't preclude it.\n*   Example: H1 kicks M1, M2, M3. M1, M2, M3 kick H1. This satisfies the rule. In this case, H1 *did* kick every monkey.\n*   So, \"No humans kicked every monkey\" is not necessarily true. It could be false if there's a human who kicked every monkey.\n\n**5. There is a human that every monkey kicked.**\n*   The kicking rule states: \"Every human kicked a monkey that kicked it.\" This means for every human 'h', there's an 'm' such that 'm kicked h'.\n*   It does *not* say that there's one specific human 'h_x' such that *every* monkey 'm_i' kicked 'h_x'.\n*   Consider a scenario: H1 kicks M1 (M1 kicks H1). H2 kicks M2 (M2 kicks H2).\n*   In this case, M1 did not kick H2, and M2 did not kick H1. So there is no single human that *every* monkey kicked.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. Every human kicked every monkey.**\n*   The kicking rule states: \"Every human kicked *a* monkey that kicked it.\" It does not say *every* monkey.\n*   This is a much stronger claim than what's given.\n*   Consider the same scenario as in statement 2: H1 kicks M1. H2 kicks M2.\n*   H1 did not kick M2. H2 did not kick M1. So, \"Every human kicked every monkey\" is false in this scenario.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion based on the Kicking Rule:**\n\nOnly statement 1 is directly and necessarily implied by the kicking rule and the existence of humans. The other statements are either too strong, too weak, or directly contradicted.\n\n**Do the Lewis/Hazel conditions affect the kicking statements?**\n\nThe Lewis/Hazel conditions (points 4 and 5) deal with \"asleep,\" \"chase,\" and \"will_run\" predicates. These predicates are entirely separate from the \"kicked\" predicate. There is no logical connection established between these two sets of predicates. Therefore, the Lewis/Hazel conditions do not provide any information that would change the truth value of the statements about kicking.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   **Statement 1: A human kicked a monkey.**\n    *   \"Every human kicked a monkey that kicked it.\"\n    *   There is at least one human.\n    *   Therefore, that human kicked a monkey. **TRUE.**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

(D -> not saw Lewis)\n*   Every monkey saw Alfred. (M -> saw Alfred)\n*   Hazel doesn't see Hazel. (This is a general truth, not specific to the animal types, but good to note).\n*   A monkey chased Alfred. (M_x chased Alfred)\n*   A monkey saw Alfred only if Lewis chased Lewis. (M_y saw Alfred -> Lewis chased Lewis)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" and \"A monkey saw Alfred only if Lewis chased Lewis\", we can deduce something crucial.\n\n1.  **Every monkey saw Alfred.**\n2.  **A monkey saw Alfred only if Lewis chased Lewis.** This can be rephrased as: If there exists a monkey that saw Alfred, then Lewis chased Lewis.\n\nSince we know that *every* monkey saw Alfred, it means there *does* exist a monkey that saw Alfred (in fact, all of them did).\n\nTherefore, the condition for \"Lewis chased Lewis\" is met.\n\n**Deduction 1: Lewis chased Lewis.**\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n*   **1. Alfred isn't a donkey.**\n    *   We know \"Every monkey saw Alfred\".\n    *   We also know \"No donkeys saw Lewis\".\n    *   We don't have direct information about what Alfred is. Alfred could be a human, a donkey, or a monkey. If Alfred were a donkey, then a monkey saw a donkey. This doesn't contradict \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" (Alfred is a donkey, not Lewis). This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **2. Lewis chased Lewis.**\n    *   As deduced above, this statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **3. Lewis is a donkey.**\n    *   We know \"No donkeys saw Lewis\".\n    *   If Lewis is a donkey, then Lewis (a donkey) saw Lewis (himself). This would contradict \"No donkeys saw Lewis\".\n    *   Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey. This statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **4. Lewis didn't chase Lewis.**\n    *   This is the opposite of statement 2, which we determined must be true. So, this statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **5. Alfred is a donkey.**\n    *   As discussed for statement 1, we don't have enough information to confirm or deny this. It's possible, but not necessary.\n\n*   **6. Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n    *   As deduced for statement 3, if Lewis were a donkey, it would contradict \"No donkeys saw Lewis\". Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey. This statement **must be true**.\n\n**Summary of Must-Be-True Statements:**\n\n*   Lewis chased Lewis.\n*   Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{2, 6}}$",

Each human might have been kicked by a different donkey.\n    *   So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **Every donkey kicked every human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, K(d, h))\n    *   This is a very strong statement. Our rule only says that for every human, *some* donkey kicked them back. It doesn't say *all* donkeys kicked *all* humans.\n    *   This is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Every donkey kicked a human.** (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H, K(d, h))\n    *   Let's re-examine the core rule: For every h \u2208 H, there exists a d \u2208 D such that K(h, d) AND K(d, h).\n    *   This means that for every human, there is at least one donkey that kicked that human.\n    *   Now, consider an arbitrary donkey, say 'x'. Does 'x' necessarily kick *a* human?\n    *   The rule states that *every human* has a reciprocal kicking relationship with *some donkey*. It doesn't state that *every donkey* has a reciprocal kicking relationship with *some human*.\n    *   For example, imagine H = {h1}, D = {d1, d2}.\n        *   h1 kicked d1, and d1 kicked h1. (This satisfies the rule for h1).\n        *   What about d2? The rule doesn't say anything about d2 kicking anyone. d2 might not have kicked any human.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **No donkeys kicked a human.** (\u00ac\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H, K(d, h)) which simplifies to (\u2200d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, \u00acK(d, h))\n    *   This directly contradicts our core rule. The core rule states that for every human, there *is* a donkey that kicked it. So, there must be at least one donkey that kicked at least one human.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5.  **A donkey kicked a human.** (\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H, K(d, h))\n    *   From the core rule: \"Every human kicked a donkey that kicked it.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one human (stated in the problem: \"there's at least one of each\"), let's call this human 'h1'.\n    *   According to the rule, h1 kicked a donkey (let's call it 'd1') AND d1 kicked h1.\n    *   So, we have found a donkey (d1) that kicked a human (h1).\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6.  **No donkeys kicked every human.** (\u00ac\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, K(d, h))\n    *   This is the negation of statement 1.\n    *   Statement 1 was \"A donkey kicked every human.\" (\u2203d \u2208 D, \u2200h \u2208 H, K(d, h))\n    *   Since statement 1 is not necessarily true (it could be false), its negation (statement 6) is not necessarily true either. It could be true, or it could be false.\n    *   For example, if there's only one human and one donkey, and they kick each other, then \"A donkey kicked every human\" is true, making \"No donkeys kicked every human\" false.\n    *   If there are multiple humans and each is kicked by a different donkey, then \"A donkey kicked every human\" is false, making \"No donkeys kicked every human\" true.\n    *   Since we cannot definitively say it must be true, it's not the answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the core rule \"Every human kicked a donkey that kicked it\" and the fact that there is at least one human, it necessarily follows that there is at least one donkey that kicked at least one human.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

If no donkeys kicked a human, then statement (1) \"Every donkey kicked a human that kicked it\" would be false, because for any donkey, there would be no human it kicked (let alone one that kicked it back).\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n3.  **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n    *   This means $\\neg (\\exists d \\in D, \\forall h \\in H, d \\text{ kicked } h)$.\n    *   This is the negation of statement 1.\n    *   We don't have enough information to definitively say this is true.

No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n    *   \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" is not supported. We only know Lewis saw every donkey, not the other way around.\n    *   \"Lewis isn't a donkey.\" If Lewis saw *every* donkey, and there's at least one donkey, then Lewis cannot be a donkey himself, because he would have to see himself, which is generally not implied by \"seeing every X\" in this context (it usually implies seeing distinct entities). More importantly, if Lewis *is* a donkey, then he is one of the \"every donkey\" that he saw. This is a bit of a philosophical point, but typically \"X saw every Y\" implies X is distinct from Y. However, the core issue is \"No donkeys saw Lewis\" which is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **2. Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n    *   We know \"Lewis saw every donkey.\" This statement is the inverse. Just because Lewis saw every donkey, it doesn't mean every donkey saw Lewis. For example, Lewis could be a hidden observer. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **3. Lewis saw a donkey.**\n    *   Since \"Lewis saw every donkey\" and we know \"there's at least one of each\" (meaning there's at least one donkey), it logically follows that Lewis must have seen at least one donkey. This statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **4. A donkey saw Lewis.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, this is the inverse. We only know Lewis saw donkeys, not that any donkey saw Lewis. This is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **5. Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 2. Since statement 2 (\"Every donkey saw Lewis\") is not necessarily true, its negation (\"Not all donkeys saw Lewis\") is also not necessarily true. It could be true, or it could be false (if every donkey *did* see Lewis). We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n\n*   **6. No donkeys saw Lewis.**\n    *   This is a stronger version of \"Not all donkeys saw Lewis.\" Again, we don't have information to support this. It's possible some donkeys saw Lewis, or none did. We only know Lewis saw them.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the given information, the only statement that *must be true* is that Lewis saw at least one donkey, which is captured by statement 3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

If every donkey chased h\u2080, then certainly *a* donkey (any donkey) chased *a* human (h\u2080).\n    *   **This must be true.**\n\n2.  **There is a donkey that every human chased.**\n    *   P3 tells us about a human chased by all donkeys. It does *not* tell us anything about a donkey being chased by all humans. This is the inverse relationship and is not guaranteed by P3.\n    *   **This is not necessarily true.**\n\n3.  **Every donkey chased every human.**\n    *   P3 states that every donkey chased *a specific* human (h\u2080). It does not state that every donkey chased *every single* human. There could be other humans that some donkeys did not chase.\n    *   **This is not necessarily true.**\n\n4.  **No donkeys chased a human.**\n    *   This directly contradicts P3, which states that every donkey chased at least one human (h\u2080).\n    *   **This must be false.**\n\n5.  **A donkey chased every human.**\n    *   P3 states that every donkey chased *a specific* human (h\u2080). It does not state that there is *one specific donkey* that chased *every single human*. This is a different quantification.\n    *   **This is not necessarily true.**\n\n6.  **No donkeys chased every human.**\n    *   This means for every donkey, there is at least one human that it did not chase.\n    *   P3 states that every donkey chased *a specific* human (h\u2080). It does not preclude the possibility that some donkey (or even all donkeys) chased *every* human. For example, if there's only one human (h\u2080), then every donkey chasing h\u2080 means every donkey chased every human.\n    *   However, if there are multiple humans (h\u2080, h\u2081, h\u2082...), P3 only guarantees that every donkey chased h\u2080. It doesn't say anything about h\u2081 or h\u2082.\n    *   Consider the case where there are two humans, H = {h1, h2}. P3 says there is a human that every donkey chased, let's say h1. So, every donkey chased h1. This doesn't mean that no donkey chased h2. It's possible that some donkey chased h2, or even that every donkey chased h2 as well.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate. P3: \u2203h\u2080 \u2208 H such that \u2200d \u2208 D, d chased h\u2080.\n        Option 6: \u2200d \u2208 D, \u2203h \u2208 H such that d did not chase h.\n        Can both be true? Yes. If H = {h1, h2}, and every donkey chased h1, but no donkey chased h2. Then P3 is true. And if no donkey chased h2, then for every donkey d, d did not chase h2, so option 6 is true.\n        Can option 6 be false? If option 6 is false, then \u2203d \u2208 D such that \u2200h \u2208 H, d chased h. (i.e., there is a donkey that chased every human). This is perfectly compatible with P3. P3 says every donkey chased *at least one specific human*. It doesn't say that no donkey chased *all* humans.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true due to the direct implication of P3. The other statements are either not necessarily true or directly contradicted.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

It means for any individual 'x', if 'x' is a monkey, then 'x' saw Alfred.\n\n*   **Consider Lewis's identity again:**\n    *   Lewis isn't happy (9).\n    *   If Lewis were a human, Lewis would be happy (4). So Lewis is not human.\n    *   Therefore, Lewis is either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n*   **What about Hazel?**\n    *   A monkey saw Hazel (3). This means Hazel exists.\n    *   Hazel didn't chase Hazel (8). This doesn't tell us much about Hazel's species directly, but it implies Hazel is an individual.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's go through each statement and see if it *must* be true.\n\n**1. Alfred saw a monkey.**\n    *   We know \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" (6). This means for every monkey M, M saw Alfred.\n    *   This does *not* automatically mean Alfred saw a monkey. Alfred could be blind, or looking the other way. The action \"saw\" is directional. If A saw B, it doesn't mean B saw A.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" (6).\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**3. A monkey saw Alfred.**\n    *   We are given \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" (6).\n    *   We are also told \"there's at least one of each\" (2), meaning there is at least one monkey.\n    *   If there is at least one monkey, and *every* monkey saw Alfred, then it *must* be true that a monkey saw Alfred.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**4. Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" (6).\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**5. Alfred drank.**\n    *   We know \"only humans drank\" (4).\n    *   For Alfred to have drunk, Alfred must be a human.\n    *   Do we know Alfred's species?\n        *   Lewis saw Alfred (5).\n        *   Every monkey saw Alfred (6).\n        *   We don't know if Alfred is a human, a donkey, or a monkey.\n        *   If Alfred were a donkey or a monkey, Alfred could not have drunk.\n        *   Since we don't know Alfred's species, we cannot conclude Alfred drank.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. Alfred saw every monkey.**\n    *   We know \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" (6).\n    *   As explained for statement 1, \"A saw B\" does not imply \"B saw A\". Even if every monkey saw Alfred, Alfred might not have seen any of them, let alone every single one.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   Statement 3 (\"A monkey saw Alfred\") is the only one that directly follows from \"Every monkey saw Alfred\" and the existence of at least one monkey.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

(This implies Lewis could be a human, or something else that can be happy, but the \"Every human is happy\" is more general).\n*   **Hazel's Hunger:** Hazel isn't hungry if and only if no humans are hungry.\n    *   Let HNH = \"Hazel isn't hungry\"\n    *   Let NHH = \"No humans are hungry\"\n    *   So, HNH <=> NHH\n*   **Hazel's Sight:** Hazel saw Hazel.\n*   **Sleep:** Only donkeys are asleep. This means:\n    *   If something is asleep, it's a donkey.\n    *   If something is not a donkey, it's not asleep.\n    *   Humans are not asleep.\n    *   Monkeys are not asleep.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each of the numbered statements to see if they *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 1: Hazel doesn't see Hazel and every human is happy.**\n\n*   \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\": The given information explicitly states \"Hazel saw Hazel.\" Therefore, \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" is false.\n*   \"Every human is happy\": The given information explicitly states \"Every human is happy.\" This is true.\n*   Since the first part of the conjunction is false, the entire conjunction \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel and every human is happy\" is **false**.\n\n**Statement 2: A human is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.**\n\n*   \"A human is happy\": Since \"Every human is happy\" and there's at least one human, it must be true that \"A human is happy.\"\n*   \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\": As established above, this is false because \"Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n*   Since the second part of the conjunction is false, the entire conjunction \"A human is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" is **false**.\n\n**Statement 3: Hazel saw Hazel and every human is happy.**\n\n*   \"Hazel saw Hazel\": The given information explicitly states this. This is true.\n*   \"Every human is happy\": The given information explicitly states this. This is true.\n*   Since both parts of the conjunction are true, the entire conjunction \"Hazel saw Hazel and every human is happy\" is **true**.\n\n**Statement 4: A human is happy but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n\n*   \"A human is happy\": True (as established in Statement 2).\n*   \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\": This is equivalent to \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel,\" which is false.\n*   Since the second part of the conjunction (implied by \"but\") is false, the entire statement is **false**.\n\n**Statement 5: Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n\n*   Let A = \"Every human is asleep.\"\n*   Let B = \"Not all humans are asleep.\"\n*   The statement is A <=> B.\n*   From \"Only donkeys are asleep,\" we know that humans are not asleep.\n*   Therefore, \"Every human is asleep\" (A) is **false**.\n*   If \"Every human is asleep\" is false, then it must be true that \"Not all humans are asleep\" (B). (If not all humans are asleep, then some are not asleep, which is consistent with no humans being asleep).\n*   So, we have False <=> True.\n*   A biconditional (X <=> Y) is true only if X and Y have the same truth value. Since False and True have different truth values, the statement \"False <=> True\" is **false**.\n\n**Statement 6: Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n\n*   Let X = \"Not all donkeys will run.\"\n*   Let Y = \"Every donkey will run.\"\n*   The statement is X and Y.\n*   If \"Every donkey will run\" (Y) is true, then it logically implies that \"Not all donkeys will run\" (X) must be false (because if *every* donkey runs, then it's not true that *not all* donkeys run).\n*   Therefore, X and Y cannot both be true simultaneously. If Y is true, X is false. If X is true, Y is false.\n*   A conjunction (X and Y) requires both parts to be true. Since X and Y are contradictory, they cannot both be true.\n*   Therefore, the statement \"Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run\" is **false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",
