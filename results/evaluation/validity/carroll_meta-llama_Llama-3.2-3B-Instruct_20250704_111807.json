We know that Zindle is uffish, but we don't have any information about whether Zindle will burble.\n\n4. Zindle won't burble.\n\nThis statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information. We know that if Zindle won't burble, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo, but we don't have any information about whether Zindle won't burble.\n\n5. Zindle and Bungo will burble.\n\nThis statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information. We know that every borogove snicker-snacked a tove, but we don't have any information about whether Zindle and Bungo will burble.\n\n6. A rath is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\nThis statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information. We know that a rath galumphed over Zindle, but we don't have any information about whether a rath is uffish.\n\nHowever, we can analyze the given statements and the information provided to find a connection between them.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that every borogove snicker-snacked a tove, and a rath galumphed over Zindle. We also know that if a rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\n\nLet's analyze statement 4: If Zindle won't burble, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\nIf Zindle won't burble, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo. This statement implies that if Zindle won't burble, then there are two possibilities: either no raths galumphed over Bungo, or all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\nHowever, we know that a rath galumphed over Zindle, and Zindle is uffish. Since every borogove snicker-snacked a tove, and Zindle is uffish, it is possible that all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\nTherefore, if Zindle won't burble, then all toves galumphed over Bungo, which means that no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement 6: A rath is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\nSince we know that a rath galumphed over Zindle, and we have determined that if Zindle won't burble, then all toves galumphed over Bungo, and no raths galumphed over Bungo, it is possible that a rath is uffish.\n\nTherefore, statement 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n6.

No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   - This statement is possible, but it does not provide any information about whether Zindle snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n6. A tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n   - This statement is possible, but it does not provide any information about whether Zindle snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that statements 2 and 6 are the only possibilities. However, we cannot determine which one is true without more information.\n\nHowever, we can use the process of elimination to find a statement that must be true. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Zindle snicker-snacked every tove. \n\nFrom statement 1, we know that not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo. \n\nSince everything is a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and there's at least one of each, we can conclude that Bungo is a tove.\n\nSince Zindle snicker-snacked every tove (statement 2), and Bungo is a tove, we can conclude that Zindle snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is true.\n\nThe final answer is: 2.",

Not all raths gimbled: This statement cannot be true because we know that every rath gimbled.\n\n3. A rath gimbled: This statement is true because we know that every rath gimbled.\n\n4. No raths gimbled: This statement cannot be true because we know that every rath gimbled.\n\n5. Bungo gimbled: This statement cannot be determined as true or false because we don't have any information about Bungo's behavior.\n\n6. Not all raths gimbled if and only if a rath gimbled: This statement is true because it is a tautology. If a rath gimbled, then not all raths gimbled, and if not all raths gimbled, then a rath gimbled.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n6. Not all raths gimbled if and only if a rath gimbled.",

We know that not all borogoves will whiffle, but we don't have any information about Rafin's whiffing behavior.\n\n2. Only toves are mimsy and no borogoves will whiffle: This statement is true.

We know that Rafin is a tove, but we don't have any information about his whiffing behavior.\n\n4. A borogove is mimsy or not all toves will whiffle: This statement is true. If not all toves will whiffle, then it is possible that a borogove is mimsy.\n\n5. A borogove is mimsy unless not all toves will whiffle: This statement is false. We know that not all borogoves will whiffle, but we don't have any information about the whiffing behavior of borogoves.\n\n6. Not all borogoves will whiffle and only toves are mimsy: This statement is true. We know that not all borogoves will whiffle, and we also know that only toves are mimsy.\n\nTherefore, the true statements are:\n\n- 2. Only toves are mimsy and no borogoves will whiffle.\n- 4.
