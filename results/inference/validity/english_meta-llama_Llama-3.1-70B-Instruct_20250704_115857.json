This means that if Alfred is a human, he must be happy.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that a monkey chased Alfred. This does not provide direct information about Alfred's happiness, but it does tell us that Lewis is happy. Since Lewis is happy, Lewis must be a human (from statement 2).\n\nFrom statement 4, we have two possibilities:\n- Every human saw Hazel.\n- Every donkey chased Alfred.\n\nIf every human saw Hazel, then Hazel must be visible to humans. However, this does not provide direct information about Alfred's happiness.\n\nIf every donkey chased Alfred, then it's possible that Alfred is a donkey (since donkeys are chasing him). However, this would not necessarily make Alfred happy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. Alfred and Hazel are happy: We don't have enough information to confirm that Hazel is happy, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. A human will attack and no humans will attack: This statement is contradictory and cannot be true.\n\n3. A monkey is happy and every human chased Alfred: We don't have information about the monkey's happiness, and we don't know if every human chased Alfred, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.

Since a monkey kicked Alfred, and only humans will run, Alfred cannot be a human (because if he were, the monkey wouldn't have kicked him, as the condition for kicking is related to running). \n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. Alfred drank and not all humans will run. This statement is false because we know only humans will run.\n2. Alfred drank and only humans will run. This statement is true because we know only humans will run, and Alfred drank.\n3. Alfred drank and no humans will run. This statement is false because we know only humans will run.\n4. Alfred won't run. This statement is true because Alfred is not a human (as deduced earlier), and only humans will run.\n5. Alfred will run. This statement is false because Alfred is not a human.\n6. Alfred and Hazel will run. This statement is false because Alfred is not a human.\n\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n\n- 2. Alfred drank and only humans will run.\n- 4.

We only know that a monkey kicked Hazel unless every donkey chased Alfred, but we don't have enough information to confirm that every monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n2.

We know that a monkey kicked Hazel unless every donkey chased Alfred, and since not all donkeys chased Alfred, it's possible that a monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n3. A monkey kicked Hazel.\n   - This statement must be true. We know that not all donkeys chased Alfred, and according to statement 4, a monkey kicked Hazel unless every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n4. Hazel kicked a monkey.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. There is no information provided that suggests Hazel kicked a monkey.\n\n5. Not all monkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - This statement must be true. We know that a monkey kicked Hazel, but we don't have enough information to confirm that every monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n6.

Every monkey chased every human that chased every monkey.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that every monkey chased every donkey.

Hazel drank: We don't have enough information to confirm that Hazel drank.\n\n5. Alfred isn't asleep and Hazel isn't asleep: This statement might be false, as we know Alfred might be asleep and Hazel might be asleep.\n\n6. Alfred isn't asleep but it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep: This statement is the most likely to be true. We know Alfred might be asleep, but we also know that it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep (which means Alfred might be asleep). However, the statement says Alfred isn't asleep, which is a possibility. The second part of the statement says it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep, which aligns with the given information that Hazel might be asleep.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we can see that statement 6 is actually not necessarily true. The correct interpretation of the given information is that Alfred might be asleep, and Hazel might be asleep. \n\nThe correct answer is actually none of the above statements must be true.",

If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\n6. Only donkeys are asleep, but it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.\n\nFrom statement 6, we know that Hazel is asleep and she is a donkey (since only donkeys are asleep).\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n2. Lewis saw every donkey.\n3. Every donkey saw Lewis.\n4. A donkey saw Lewis.\n5. Lewis saw a donkey.\n6. No donkeys saw Lewis.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that Hazel saw Lewis. Since Hazel is a donkey, we can conclude that at least one donkey (Hazel) saw Lewis. This eliminates statement 6 (No donkeys saw Lewis).\n\nNow, let's analyze the remaining statements. We know that Hazel is asleep and she is a donkey. Statement 4 says that if not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry. Since Hazel is asleep, it is possible that not all humans are asleep. If Lewis is not hungry, then not all donkeys saw Hazel. However, we know that Hazel saw Lewis, so it is possible that Lewis is hungry.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 5. If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry. This statement implies that if Lewis is hungry, then no humans are hungry. However, we don't have enough information to conclude that Lewis is hungry or not.\n\nConsidering the given information, we can conclude that at least one donkey (Hazel) saw Lewis. This makes statement 4 (A donkey saw Lewis) true.\n\nFinal answer: Statement 4 (A donkey saw Lewis) must be true in this situation.",

Since \"No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis,\" we can say that \"Hazel is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred\" is equivalent to \"Hazel is happy just in case not all humans kicked Lewis\" (given condition 2). But this connection does not make statement 1 or 3 necessarily true, as it is not a direct implication of the given conditions.\n\nBut we can make a conclusion about statement 3. Since \"No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis,\" and \"Hazel is happy just in case not all humans kicked Lewis,\" we can say that \"Hazel is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is true, but only because of the given conditions that connect the two. However, this is not among the options.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that statement 3 is the closest to being true, but it is not among the options.",

This directly supports statement 5: \"Lewis saw a donkey.\" Since there's at least one donkey, and Lewis saw every donkey, it must be true that Lewis saw a donkey.\n\nNow, let's analyze the other statements:\n\n1. No donkeys saw Lewis: We don't have enough information to confirm this statement. It's possible that some donkeys saw Lewis, but we can't be sure.\n2. A donkey saw Lewis: Similar to statement 1, we don't have enough information to confirm this statement.\n3. No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey: We can't confirm that Lewis isn't a donkey, and we also can't confirm that no donkeys saw Lewis.\n4. Every donkey saw Lewis: We don't have enough information to confirm this statement. It's possible that some donkeys saw Lewis, but we can't be sure that every donkey saw him.\n6. Not all donkeys saw Lewis: This statement is the negation of statement 4. Since we can't confirm that every donkey saw Lewis, we can't rule out the possibility that not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n\nHowever, we can't confirm that not all donkeys saw Lewis with absolute certainty. But we can confirm that statement 5 is true.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n5. Lewis saw a donkey.",

There is not a donkey that every donkey chased.\n3. Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\n4. Not all monkeys will run but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n\nFrom statement 4, we can infer that Hazel chased Alfred. Since Hazel and Alfred can be either a donkey, human, or monkey, we have a few possibilities:\n\n- If Hazel is a monkey and Alfred is a human, then a monkey chased a human.\n- If Hazel is a donkey and Alfred is a human, then a donkey chased a human.\n- If Hazel is a monkey and Alfred is a monkey, then a monkey chased a monkey (this doesn't provide any information about donkeys or humans).\n- If Hazel is a donkey and Alfred is a monkey, then a donkey chased a monkey (this doesn't provide any information about donkeys chasing humans).\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. A donkey chased every human: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm that every human was chased by a donkey.\n\n2. Every donkey chased a human: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm that every donkey chased a human.\n\n3. A donkey chased a human: This statement is possible but not necessarily true. If Hazel is a donkey and Alfred is a human, then this statement is true.

If Hazel is a donkey and Alfred is a human, then this statement is false.\n\n5. No donkeys chased every human: This statement is true. If every donkey had chased every human, then there would be a donkey (the one that chased every human) that every donkey chased, which contradicts statement 2.\n\n6. Every donkey chased every human: This statement is not necessarily true. This would imply that there is a donkey that every donkey chased, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n5.

Alfred will run.\n3. Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel.\n4. Not all humans will run and no humans will run.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that no humans will run. Since Alfred will run (statement 2), Alfred cannot be a human. This eliminates statement 1 as a possibility.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement 3: \"Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if a human chased Hazel.\" This statement implies that if a human chased Hazel, then Alfred won't see himself. However, this is a conditional statement and doesn't provide direct information about Alfred's species or running status.\n\nConsidering statement 2 (\"Alfred will run\") and the fact that no humans will run, we can conclude that Alfred is not a human. This supports statement 6: \"Alfred isn't a human.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining options:\n\n- Statements 2 and 4 are contradictory, as statement 2 says Alfred will run, while statement 4 implies that if Hazel and Alfred will run, it's not possible since no humans will run, but we already know Alfred isn't a human.\n- Statement 3 is not necessarily true, as it's a conditional statement and we don't have enough information to confirm it.\n- Statement 5 (\"Hazel will run\") is not necessarily true, as we don't have enough information about Hazel's species or running status.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that statement 6 (\"Alfred isn't a human\") must be true, given that Alfred will run and no humans will run.\n\nFinal answer: Statement 6: \"Alfred isn't a human.\"",

If Alfred is a donkey, then he will run, but if he's a human or a monkey, we don't have enough information to say he will run.\n- Statement 3: Alfred doesn't see Hazel. We can't confirm this statement, as there's no information provided about Alfred's actions or what he sees.\n- Statement 5: Hazel doesn't see Alfred. This statement is false, as we've already established that Hazel saw Alfred (since she's a monkey and every monkey saw Alfred).\n- Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel will run.

A donkey chased a monkey that chased a human.\n3. Not all humans will run.\n4. Only donkeys are asleep.\n5. It is not the case that Lewis drank (this statement doesn't provide much information, but we can infer that Lewis is not asleep since only donkeys are asleep and it's not the case that Lewis drank, which might imply Lewis is awake).\n6. It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry (this statement implies Lewis is hungry).\n\nFrom the given information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since a donkey chased a monkey that chased a human, at least one human will run (the one being chased).\n- Since not all humans will run, there must be at least one human who won't run.\n- Since only donkeys are asleep, no humans or monkeys are asleep.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. A human is asleep or not all donkeys will run. This statement is not necessarily true because we know that no humans are asleep.\n2. Lewis will run. We can't be certain about this, as Lewis might be the human who won't run.\n3. Not all humans will run and only donkeys are asleep. This statement is true based on the given information.\n4. Only donkeys are asleep and no humans will run. This statement is not necessarily true because we know that at least one human will run (the one being chased).\n5. A human is asleep unless not all donkeys will run. This statement is not necessarily true because we know that no humans are asleep.\n6. Lewis won't run. We can't be certain about this, as Lewis might be the human who will run.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nStatement 3: Not all humans will run and only donkeys are asleep.",

Alfred drank and every monkey drank.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that a human saw Lewis, and Lewis is happy. This doesn't provide any direct information about drinking, but it tells us that Lewis is not unhappy.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that Alfred drank and every monkey drank. This means that if Alfred is a monkey, then he drank. If Alfred is not a monkey, then he still drank.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n1. A human saw Lewis and Alfred drank. This statement must be true because we know a human saw Lewis (statement 3) and Alfred drank (statement 4).\n\n2. A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Alfred drank. This statement cannot be true because we know Alfred drank (statement 4).\n\n3. Alfred didn't drink. This statement cannot be true because we know Alfred drank (statement 4).\n\n4. Lewis drank. We don't have enough information to confirm this statement. Lewis could be a donkey, human, or monkey, and we don't know if donkeys or humans drank.\n\n5. Alfred and Lewis drank. We don't have enough information to confirm this statement. While we know Alfred drank, we don't know if Lewis drank.\n\n6. Alfred and Hazel drank. We don't have enough information to confirm this statement. While we know Alfred drank, we don't know if Hazel drank.\n\nBased on the given information, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n1.
