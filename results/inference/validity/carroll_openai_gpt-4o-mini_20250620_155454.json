(Not necessarily true, as we don't know if Zindle or Bungo are borogoves.)\n   - **Statement 2**: Zindle won't whiffle. (This could be true since Zindle is not confirmed to be a borogove.)\n   - **Statement 3**: Zindle gyred and only borogoves will whiffle. (This is true, but we don't know if Zindle is a borogove.)\n   - **Statement 4**: Zindle gyred and not all borogoves will whiffle. (This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm.)\n   - **Statement 5**: Zindle gyred and no borogoves will whiffle. (This contradicts the fact that only borogoves will whiffle.)\n   - **Statement 6**: Zindle will whiffle.

If Bungo chortled at every tove, then at least one tove would have to chortle back at Bungo, which is not possible.\n\n2. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**  \n   - This must be true because we know that no toves chortled at Bungo. Therefore, it is true that not all toves chortled at Bungo (in fact, none did).\n\n3. **Bungo chortled at a tove.**  \n   - This cannot be determined as true. We have no information that confirms Bungo chortled at any tove.\n\n4. **Every tove chortled at Bungo.**  \n   - This is false because we know that no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n5. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**  \n   - The first part is true (not all toves chortled at Bungo), but the second part is false (Bungo did not chortle at any toves). Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at Bungo.**  \n   - This is false because we know that no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 2.

Everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there is at least one of each.\n2. No raths chortled at a tove.\n3. Not all toves chortled at Bungo, and no toves chortled at Bungo.\n4. If Zindle gimbled, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if no toves gimbled.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Every tove chortled at a rath.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. We know that no raths chortled at a tove, but we have no information about whether all toves chortled at raths.\n\n2. **A tove chortled at every rath.**  \n   This is also not necessarily true. Similar to the first statement, we cannot conclude that a tove chortled at every rath.\n\n3. **No raths chortled at every tove.**  \n   This statement is true because it is given that no raths chortled at a tove.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at every rath.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. We do not have information that prevents some toves from chortling at raths.\n\n5. **Every tove chortled at every rath.**  \n   This is not true based on the information we have. We cannot conclude that every tove chortled at every rath.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at a rath.**  \n   This is not necessarily true. We do not have enough information to conclude that at least one tove chortled at a rath.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. No raths chortled at every tove.** \n\nFinal answer: **3. No raths chortled at every tove.**",
