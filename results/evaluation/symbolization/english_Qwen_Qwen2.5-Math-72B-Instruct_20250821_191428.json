      "question": "Sentence:\n\nNot all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack.\n\nAbbreviations:\n\nM: [1] is a donkey\nG: [1] will attack",
      "model_response": "To formalize the sentence \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack\" using the given abbreviations, we need to break down the sentence into its logical components and then translate it into predicate logic.\n\nThe sentence can be rephrased as: \"If not all donkeys will attack, then every donkey will attack.\"\n\nLet's define the components:\n- \"Not all donkeys will attack\" can be expressed as: It is not the case that every donkey will attack, or in logical terms: \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)).\n- \"Every donkey will attack\" is: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx).\n\nThe sentence \"Not all donkeys will attack unless every donkey will attack\" can now be written as: \"If \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)), then \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx).\"\n\nIn logical terms, this is: \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx).\n\nHowever, this statement is a contradiction because it implies that if it is not true that every donkey will attack, then it must be true that every donkey will attack. This is not possible, so the correct interpretation should be that the sentence is always true if the condition is false, which means the sentence is a tautology.\n\nThe correct formalization should be: \"If not all donkeys will attack, then it is not the case that not all donkeys will attack.\" This is a tautology and can be written as: \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)) \u2192 \u00ac(\u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx))).\n\nBut the original sentence is actually a tautology in a different form: \"If not all donkeys will attack, then every donkey will attack\" is a tautology because it is always true if the condition is false.\n\nSo the correct formalization is: \"If not all donkeys will attack, then every donkey will attack\" is a tautology and can be written as: \u00ac(\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx)) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Gx).\n\nTherefore, the correct formalization is: \\boxed{\\neg \\exists x (Mx \\land \\neg Gx) \\lor \\forall x (Mx \\rightarrow Gx)}.\n\nBut the

Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Identify the variables and their domains:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be a variable representing a monkey.\n   - Let \\( y \\) be a variable representing a human.\n\n2. Use the given abbreviations:\n   - \\( O(x) \\): \\( x \\) is a monkey.\n   - \\( N(y) \\): \\( y \\) is a human.\n   - \\( Q(x, y) \\): \\( x \\) kicked \\( y \\).\n\n3. Express the sentence in English in a form that can be easily translated to predicate logic:\n   - \"There does not exist any monkey \\( x \\) such that there exists any human \\( y \\) that \\( x \\) kicked \\( y \\).\"\n\n4. Translate this into predicate logic:\n   - The existential quantifier \"there exists\" is represented by \\( \\exists \\).\n   - The universal quantifier \"for all\" is represented by \\( \\forall \\).\n   - The negation \"not\" is represented by \\( \\neg \\).\n\n   Therefore, the sentence \"No monkeys kicked a human\" can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\neg \\exists x (O(x) \\land \\exists y (N(y) \\land Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify the expression using the properties of quantifiers and connectives:\n   - The negation of an existential quantifier is a universal quantifier, and vice versa.\n   - The negation of a conjunction is a disjunction of the negations.\n\n   Applying these rules, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\forall x \\neg (O(x) \\land \\exists y (N(y) \\land Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\forall x (\\neg O(x) \\lor \\neg \\exists y (N(y) \\land Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\forall x (\\neg O(x) \\lor \\forall y \\neg (N(y) \\land Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\forall x (\\neg O(x) \\lor \\forall y (\\neg N(y) \\lor \\neg Q(x, y)))\n   \\]\n\nHowever, the most straightforward and common way to express this sentence in predicate logic is:\n\\[\n\\neg \\exists x \\exists y (O(x) \\land N(y) \\land Q(x, y))\n\\]\n\nThus, the final formalization of the sentence \"No monkeys kicked a human\" is:\n\\boxed{\\neg \\exists x \\exists y (O(x) \\land N(y) \\land Q(x, y))}",

Construct the logical formula:\n   - The sentence \"Every donkey saw a monkey\" can be translated as \"For every \\( x \\), if \\( x \\) is a donkey, then there exists a \\( y \\) such that \\( y \\) is a monkey and \\( x \\) saw \\( y \\).\"\n   - In formal predicate logic, this is written as:\n     \\[\n     \\forall x (Mx \\rightarrow \\exists y (Oy \\land Pxy))\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the formalization of the sentence \"Every donkey saw a monkey\" is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\forall x (Mx \\rightarrow \\exists y (Oy \\land Pxy))}\n\\]",

Substitute this back into the biconditional:\n   - \u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(\u00acMx \u2228 \u00acGx)\n\nThe final formalization of the sentence in predicate logic is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\u00acNc \u2194 \u2200x(\u00acMx \u2228 \u00acGx)}\n\\]",

      "model_response": "To formalize the sentence \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey will attack\" using the given abbreviations, we need to break down the sentence into its logical components and then translate it into predicate logic.\n\nThe sentence can be rephrased as: \"If it is not the case that every donkey will attack, then a monkey is hungry.\" This is because \"unless\" can be translated as \"if not.\"\n\nHere are the steps to formalize the sentence:\n\n1. Identify the logical components:\n   - \"A monkey is hungry\" can be written as \\( Lx \\) where \\( x \\) is a monkey.\n   - \"Every donkey will attack\" can be written as \\( \\forall y (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\).\n\n2. Translate the sentence into logical form:\n   - The sentence \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey will attack\" becomes \"If it is not the case that every donkey will attack, then a monkey is hungry.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is \\( \\neg \\forall y (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\rightarrow Lx \\).\n\n3. Simplify the negation of the universal quantifier:\n   - The negation of \\( \\forall y (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\) is \\( \\exists y \\neg (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\).\n   - Using the equivalence \\( \\neg (My \\rightarrow Gy) \\equiv My \\land \\neg Gy \\), we get \\( \\exists y (My \\land \\neg Gy) \\).\n\n4. Substitute back into the logical form:\n   - The sentence now becomes \\( \\exists y (My \\land \\neg Gy) \\rightarrow Lx \\).\n\n5. Since the sentence is about a monkey in general, we can use a variable \\( x \\) and a quantifier to indicate that there exists a monkey that is hungry if there exists a donkey that will not attack:\n   - The final formalization is \\( \\exists y (My \\land \\neg Gy) \\rightarrow \\exists x (Ox \\land Lx) \\).\n\nTherefore, the formalization of the sentence \"A monkey is hungry unless every donkey will attack\" is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\exists y (My \\land \\neg Gy) \\rightarrow \\exists x (Ox \\land Lx)}\n\\]",

      "model_response": "To formalize the sentence \"Every donkey is happy unless every donkey chased Alfred\" using the given abbreviations, we need to break down the sentence into its logical components and then translate it into predicate logic.\n\n1. Identify the two main parts of the sentence:\n   - \"Every donkey is happy\" can be formalized as: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx)\n   - \"Every donkey chased Alfred\" can be formalized as: \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa)\n\n2. The sentence states that \"Every donkey is happy unless every donkey chased Alfred.\" This can be interpreted as: \"If it is not the case that every donkey chased Alfred, then every donkey is happy.\" In logical terms, this is: \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx).\n\n3. Using the logical equivalence of \u00ac\u2200x(Px) \u2261 \u2203x(\u00acPx), we can rewrite \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) as \u2203x(\u00ac(Mx \u2192 Rxa)). And using the logical equivalence of \u00ac(P \u2192 Q) \u2261 P \u2227 \u00acQ, we can further rewrite \u00ac(Mx \u2192 Rxa) as Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa. Therefore, \u00ac\u2200x(Mx \u2192 Rxa) is equivalent to \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa).\n\n4. Substituting this back into our formula, we get: \u2203x(Mx \u2227 \u00acRxa) \u2192 \u2200x(Mx \u2192 Kx).\n\nSo, the formalization of the sentence \"Every donkey is happy unless every donkey chased Alfred\" in predicate logic is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\exists x(Mx \\land \\neg Rxa) \\rightarrow \\forall x(Mx \\rightarrow Kx)}\n\\]",
