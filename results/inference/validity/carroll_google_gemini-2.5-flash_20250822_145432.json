We don't know Bungo's type yet.\n\n4.  **\"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle.\"**\n    *   `NOT snicker_snacked(Bungo, Zindle)`\n    *   `NOT chortled_at(Rafin, Zindle)`\n    *   This introduces Zindle and Rafin. We don't know their types. This information seems largely irrelevant to the statements about Toves, Borogoves, and Raths, unless Bungo or Zindle are one of those types. Let's assume for now they are not, or their types don't affect the core T/B/R logic.\n\n5.  **\"Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo just in case every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\"**\n    *   `(For every `r` in R, `snicker_snacked(r, Bungo)`) IFF (For every `b` in B, `snicker_snacked(b, Bungo)`)`\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n---\n\n**Statement 1: \"No toves chortled at a rath.\"**\n\n*   This means: For every `t` in T, for every `r` in R, `NOT chortled_at(t, r)`.\n*   This directly contradicts Fact 1: \"Every tove chortled at a rath.\" Fact 1 states that for every tove, there *is* at least one rath it chortled at.\n*   Therefore, Statement 1 **must be false**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 2: \"There is a tove that every rath chortled at.\"**\n\n*   This means: There exists a `t` in T such that for every `r` in R, `chortled_at(r, t)`.\n*   The given facts do not provide any information about raths chortling at toves. Fact 1 is about toves chortling at raths.\n*   We cannot deduce this from the given information. It *might* be true, or it *might* be false.\n*   Therefore, Statement 2 **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 3: \"No toves chortled at every rath.\"**\n\n*   This means: For every `t` in T, there exists an `r` in R such that `NOT chortled_at(t, r)`.\n*   Let's consider the opposite: \"There exists a tove that chortled at every rath.\"\n    *   If this opposite were true, it would mean there's a `t0` such that for all `r`, `chortled_at(t0, r)`. This is consistent with Fact 1 (if `t0` chortled at *every* rath, it certainly chortled at *a* rath).\n*   The given facts do not preclude a scenario where one or more toves chortled at *every* rath. For example, if there's only one rath, then \"every tove chortled at a rath\" implies \"every tove chortled at *the* rath\".\n*   We cannot deduce this from the given information. It *might* be true, or it *might* be false.\n*   Therefore, Statement 3 **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 4: \"A tove chortled at every rath.\"**\n\n*   This means: There exists a `t` in T such that for every `r` in R, `chortled_at(t, r)`.\n*   Similar to Statement 3, the given facts do not provide enough information to confirm or deny this.\n*   Fact 1 says \"Every tove chortled at *a* rath\" (meaning at least one). It doesn't say *every* tove chortled at *every* rath, nor does it say *no* tove chortled at *every* rath.\n*   We cannot deduce this from the given information. It *might* be true, or it *might* be false.\n*   Therefore, Statement 4 **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 5: \"Every tove chortled at every rath.\"**\n\n*   This means: For every `t` in T, for every `r` in R, `chortled_at(t, r)`.\n*   Fact 1 states: \"Every tove chortled at *a* rath.\" This is a weaker statement.\n*   Consider a scenario: Toves = {T1, T2}, Raths = {R1, R2}.\n    *   Fact 1 satisfied if: `chortled_at(T1, R1)` and `chortled_at(T2, R2)`.\n    *   Statement 5 would require: `chortled_at(T1, R1)`, `chortled_at(T1, R2)`, `chortled_at(T2, R1)`, `chortled_at(T2, R2)`.\n*   The given facts do not force this stronger condition.\n*   Therefore, Statement 5 **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 6: \"A tove chortled at a rath.\"**\n\n*   This means: There exists a `t` in T such that there exists an `r` in R such that `chortled_at(t, r)`.\n*   Fact 1 states: \"Every tove chortled at a rath.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one tove (given in the problem setup: \"there's at least one of each\"), let's call it `t0`.\n    *   According to Fact 1, `t0` chortled at a rath.\n    *   Therefore, there exists a tove (`t0`) and there exists a rath (the one `t0` chortled at) such that the tove chortled at the rath.\n*   This statement is a direct logical consequence of Fact 1 and the existence of at least one tove.\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 **must be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n*   Statement 1 is false.\n*   Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are not necessarily true.\n*   Statement 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

This statement is about Rafin chortling *at* borogoves. We have no information about Rafin's chortling habits towards borogoves. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **Statement 2: Every borogove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   We know Bungo is a borogove and Bungo chortled at Rafin. This means *at least one* borogove chortled at Rafin. However, we have no information to conclude that *every* borogove chortled at Rafin. There could be other borogoves that did not chortle at Rafin.

This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Borogoves & Whiffling:** Not all borogoves will whiffle. (This means there's at least one borogove that won't whiffle, or some borogoves will whiffle and some won't, or no borogoves will whiffle. The key is that it's not the case that *all* of them will whiffle.)\n*   **Bungo & Borogoves & Chortling:** Bungo isn't a borogove just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n    *   Let P be \"Bungo isn't a borogove.\"\n    *   Let Q be \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   The statement is \"P if and only if Q\" (P $\\iff$ Q). This means:\n        *   If Bungo isn't a borogove, then not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n        *   If not all borogoves chortled at Bungo, then Bungo isn't a borogove.\n*   **Raths & Gimbling:** Every rath gimbled.\n*   **Bungo & Chortling:** Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n\n**Analyzing the \"Bungo & Borogoves & Chortling\" statement:**\n\n\"Bungo isn't a borogove just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nWe also know: \"Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" This piece of information seems to be a red herring for the \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" part, as it doesn't directly link to *other* borogoves chortling at Bungo.\n\nLet's consider the two possibilities for Bungo's category:\n\n**Case 1: Bungo is a borogove.**\n*   If Bungo is a borogove, then \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" (P) is false.\n*   For P $\\iff$ Q to be true, Q must also be false.\n*   If Q (\"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\") is false, then its negation is true: \"All borogoves chortled at Bungo.\"\n*   So, if Bungo is a borogove, then all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n\n**Case 2: Bungo isn't a borogove.**\n*   If Bungo isn't a borogove, then \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" (P) is true.\n*   For P $\\iff$ Q to be true, Q must also be true.\n*   If Q (\"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\") is true, then not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n*   So, if Bungo isn't a borogove, then not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n\nThis statement doesn't definitively tell us whether Bungo is a borogove or not. It sets up a conditional relationship.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n1.  **Every rath gimbled and not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n    *   \"Every rath gimbled\" is directly stated in the problem. (True)\n    *   \"Not all borogoves will whiffle\" is directly stated in the problem. (True)\n    *   Since both parts are true, the conjunction is true.\n    *   **Must be true.**\n\n2.  **Every rath gimbled and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n    *   \"Every rath gimbled\" is true.\n    *   \"No borogoves will whiffle\" is *not* directly stated. \"Not all borogoves will whiffle\" means that it's not the case that *every single* borogove whiffling. This allows for \"no borogoves will whiffle\" (a subset of \"not all\"), but it also allows for \"some borogoves will whiffle and some won't.\" We cannot conclude \"no borogoves will whiffle.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Bungo will whiffle.**\n    *   We have no information about Bungo's whiffling. We don't even know what category Bungo belongs to (tove, borogove, or rath).\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n4.  **Bungo won't whiffle.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, we have no information about Bungo's whiffling.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n5.  **Not all raths will whiffle and only borogoves gimbled.**\n    *   \"Not all raths will whiffle\": We know \"Every rath gimbled,\" but we have no information about raths whiffling. This cannot be determined.\n    *   \"only borogoves gimbled\": We know \"Every rath gimbled.\" Since raths gimbled, it's false that *only* borogoves gimbled.\n    *   Since the second part is false, the entire conjunction is false.\n    *   **Must be false.**\n\n6.  **Bungo gimbled.**\n    *   We know \"Every rath gimbled.\"\n    *   If Bungo is a rath, then Bungo gimbled.\n    *   However, Bungo could be a tove or a borogove. We have no information about toves or borogoves gimbling.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot conclude that Bungo gimbled.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nStatement 1 is the only one that combines two directly stated facts.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

It doesn't directly involve toves or Rafin's category.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to be Evaluated:**\n\nLet's re-examine premise 1: **\"No toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"**\nThis is equivalent to saying: **\"It is not the case that a tove snicker-snacked Rafin.\"**\nOr, **\"For all toves X, X did not snicker-snack Rafin.\"**\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n1.  **\"Rafin is a tove.\"**\n    *   We have no information about Rafin's category. Rafin could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. The premises don't specify.\n    *   *Must be true?* No.\n\n2.  **\"Not all toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"**\n    *   Premise 1 states: \"No toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" This means *zero* toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n    *   If zero toves snicker-snacked Rafin, then it is certainly true that \"not all toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" (Because \"all toves snicker-snacked Rafin\" would imply at least one did, which contradicts premise 1).\n    *   *Must be true?* Yes, this is a direct consequence of premise 1.\n\n3.  **\"Rafin snicker-snacked a tove.\"**\n    *   We know \"No toves snicker-snacked Rafin\" (T -> not SS(T, Rafin)). This tells us about toves *doing* the snicker-snacking to Rafin.\n    *   It tells us nothing about Rafin *doing* the snicker-snacking to a tove.\n    *   *Must be true?* No.\n\n4.  **\"Every tove snicker-snacked Rafin.\"**\n    *   This directly contradicts Premise 1 (\"No toves snicker-snacked Rafin\").\n    *   *Must be true?* No, it must be false.\n\n5.  **\"A tove snicker-snacked Rafin.\"**\n    *   This also directly contradicts Premise 1 (\"No toves snicker-snacked Rafin\").\n    *   *Must be true?* No, it must be false.\n\n6.  **\"Rafin snicker-snacked every tove.\"**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, this tells us about Rafin *doing* the snicker-snacking to toves. Premise 1 is about toves *doing* the snicker-snacking to Rafin. There's no information to confirm or deny this.\n    *   *Must be true?* No.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 2, as it is a direct logical consequence of premise 1.

(Or, if X is a borogove or a rath, then X is not mimsy).\n\n**Analysis of the Statements to be Evaluated:**\n\nLet's analyze each statement based on the given rules.\n\n**1. A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n\n*   We know there's a specific tove, T_0, that every borogove galumphed over. This means for any borogove B_i, B_i galumphed over T_0.\n*   This statement asks if there exists a tove T_x and a borogove B_y such that T_x galumphed over B_y.\n*   The given information (Rule 1) is about borogoves galumphing over a tove, not the other way around.\n*   There is no information that implies a tove *must* galumph over a borogove. It's possible that no tove ever galumphs over any borogove.\n*   **Conclusion for 1:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**2. Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n\n*   This statement claims that for every tove T_x, there exists at least one borogove B_y such that T_x galumphed over B_y.\n*   Again, the given information (Rule 1) is about borogoves galumphing over *a specific* tove (T_0). It doesn't provide any information about toves galumphing over borogoves.\n*   It's possible that no tove galumphed over any borogove.\n*   **Conclusion for 2:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**3. Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n\n*   This is a very strong claim: for every tove T_x and every borogove B_y, T_x galumphed over B_y.\n*   This is even less supported than statement 2.\n*   **Conclusion for 3:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**4. No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n\n*   This statement claims that for every tove T_x, it is *not* the case that T_x galumphed over every borogove.\n*   This is equivalent to saying: for every tove T_x, there exists at least one borogove B_y such that T_x did *not* galumph over B_y.\n*   We have no information to support or refute this. It's possible that some tove *did* galumph over every borogove, or that no tove did.\n*   **Conclusion for 4:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**5. A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n\n*   This statement claims there exists at least one tove T_x such that for every borogove B_y, T_x galumphed over B_y.\n*   This is the inverse relationship of Rule 1. Rule 1 states: $\\exists T_0 \\in T$ such that $\\forall B_i \\in B$, $B_i$ galumphed over $T_0$.\n*   This statement asks: $\\exists T_x \\in T$ such that $\\forall B_y \\in B$, $T_x$ galumphed over $B_y$.\n*   There is no logical connection between these two statements. The fact that borogoves galumphed over a tove doesn't mean a tove galumphed over borogoves.\n*   **Conclusion for 5:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**6. A borogove galumphed over a tove.**\n\n*   Let's re-examine Rule 1: \"There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.\"\n*   This means: $\\exists T_0 \\in T$ such that $\\forall B_i \\in B$, $B_i$ galumphed over $T_0$.\n*   Since there is at least one borogove (given in the initial setup: \"there's at least one of each\"), let's call one such borogove B_1.\n*   According to Rule 1, B_1 galumphed over T_0.\n*   Therefore, there exists a borogove (B_1) that galumphed over a tove (T_0).\n*   This directly satisfies the statement \"A borogove galumphed over a tove.\"\n*   **Conclusion for 6:** Must be true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe information about Rafin, Bungo, snicker-snacking, chortling, and mimsy seems to be distractors for the \"galumphing\" questions. None of those rules provide any insight into the \"galumphing\" relationships between toves and borogoves, except for Rule 1. Rule 1 is the key to solving this.\n\nRule 1: \"There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.\"\nLet this specific tove be $T_k$.\nSo, for *every* borogove $B_i$, it is true that $B_i$ galumphed over $T_k$.\nWe are also told that \"there's at least one of each\" (tove, borogove, rath).\nSince there is at least one borogove, let's pick any borogove, say $B_j$.\nAccording to Rule 1, $B_j$ galumphed over $T_k$.\nThe statement \"A borogove galumphed over a tove\" means there exists *some* borogove and *some* tove such that the borogove galumphed over the tove.\nWe just showed that $B_j$ (a borogove) galumphed over $T_k$ (a tove).\nTherefore, statement 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

So, if this statement were true, it would imply $\\neg C(Bungo, Bungo)$.\n    *   We already know $\\neg C(Bungo, Bungo)$ is true from the problem statement.\n    *   However, this statement claims *no* borogoves chortled at Bungo. We only know that *Bungo* (who is a borogove) didn't chortle at Bungo. This doesn't preclude *other* borogoves from chortling at Bungo. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **Every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   This means $\\forall b \\in B : C(b, Bungo)$.\n    *   If this were true, then $C(Bungo, Bungo)$ would have to be true (since Bungo is a borogove).\n    *   But we know $\\neg C(Bungo, Bungo)$ is true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n3.  **Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   This means $\\neg (\\forall b \\in B : C(b, Bungo))$.\n    *   This is equivalent to $\\exists b \\in B : \\neg C(b, Bungo)$.\n    *   Since Bungo is a borogove, and we know $\\neg C(Bungo, Bungo)$, this means there exists at least one borogove (Bungo itself) that did not chortle at Bungo.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n4.  **Bungo chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means $\\forall b \\in B : C(Bungo, b)$.\n    *   If this were true, then $C(Bungo, Bungo)$ would have to be true (since Bungo is a borogove).\n    *   But we know $\\neg C(Bungo, Bungo)$ is true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n5.  **Bungo chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   This means $\\exists b \\in B : C(Bungo, b)$.\n    *   If this were true, it could be $C(Bungo, Bungo)$ or $C(Bungo, \\text{some other borogove})$.\n    *   We know $\\neg C(Bungo, Bungo)$. So, if this statement were true, it would imply that Bungo chortled at some *other* borogove.\n    *   We don't have information to confirm or deny this. It's not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **A borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   This means $\\exists b \\in B : C(b, Bungo)$.\n    *   If this were true, it could be $C(Bungo, Bungo)$ or $C(\\text{some other borogove}, Bungo)$.\n    *   We know $\\neg C(Bungo, Bungo)$. So, if this statement were true, it would imply that some *other* borogove chortled at Bungo.\n    *   We don't have information to confirm or deny this. It's not necessarily true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe crucial deductions are:\n1.  Bungo is a borogove. (From \"If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove.\")\n2.  Bungo did not chortle at Bungo ($\\neg C(Bungo, Bungo)$). (From \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\")\n\nGiven that Bungo is a borogove, and Bungo did not chortle at Bungo, it means there exists at least one borogove (Bungo itself) that did not chortle at Bungo. This directly supports statement 3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

Let's rephrase: If there exists a rath $R_j$ such that $R_j$ galumphed over *every* rath, then *every* tove galumphed over $R_j$.\n    *   Alternatively, if $R_j$ galumphed over $R_k$ for all $R_k$, then for all $T_i$, $T_i$ galumphed over $R_j$.\n    *   This statement seems to imply a specific relationship between toves and raths based on rath-on-rath galumphing. However, the phrasing \"every rath that galumphed over every rath\" is very strong. It means if a rath $R_j$ galumphed over *all* other raths (including itself, if galumphing is reflexive, or all other distinct raths), then every tove galumphed over $R_j$.\n    *   Let's consider the simpler interpretation: For any rath $R_j$, if $R_j$ galumphed over *every* rath (meaning for all $R_k$, $R_j$ galumphed over $R_k$), then for every tove $T_i$, $T_i$ galumphed over $R_j$.\n\n2.  \"Every rath will whiffle or Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.\"\n    *   For all $R_i$: ($R_i$ will whiffle) OR (Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin).\n    *   This means if Zindle *did* chortle at Rafin, then every rath will whiffle.\n\n3.  \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n    *   (A rath galumphed over Bungo) OR (Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle).\n    *   This is equivalent to: IF (NOT (Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle)) THEN (A rath galumphed over Bungo).\n\n4.  \"If every rath chortled at Rafin, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin won't whiffle.\"\n    *   IF (Every rath chortled at Rafin) THEN (IF (A borogove snicker-snacked Bungo) THEN (Rafin won't whiffle)).\n\n5.  \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\"\n    *   (NOT (Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle)) AND (A rath galumphed over Zindle).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet's use the premises to deduce information.\n\nFrom Premise 5:\n*   \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true.\n*   \"A rath galumphed over Zindle\" is true.\n\nNow, let's use the first part of Premise 5 (\"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\") with Premise 3:\n*   Premise 3: (A rath galumphed over Bungo) OR (Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle).\n*   Since \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true, it means \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" is false.\n*   Therefore, from Premise 3, \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\" must be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the logical deduction from Premise 5 and Premise 3, we have definitively established that \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\" must be true.\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n\n1.  Bungo galumphed over every rath. (Not necessarily true)\n2.  Every rath galumphed over Bungo. (Not necessarily true, we only know *a* rath did)\n3.  A rath galumphed over Bungo. (This is what we deduced)\n4.  Not all raths galumphed over Bungo. (Could be true, could be false. If only one rath galumphed over Bungo, and there are multiple raths, this would be true. But if all raths galumphed over Bungo, this would be false.)\n5.  Bungo galumphed over a rath. (Not necessarily true)\n6.  No raths galumphed over Bungo. (This is the opposite of what we deduced, so it must be false)\n\nTherefore, statement 3 must be true.

So, $Q$ being true is a consistent possibility.\n\nCase 2: Assume $Q$ is false (i.e., \"Not every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\").\nIf $Q$ is false, then for Premise 3 ($P \\lor Q$) to be true, $P$ must be true. So, \"Every tove is uffish\" must be true.\nIf $Q$ is false, then for Premise 4 ($P_N \\lor Q$) to be true, $P_N$ must be true. So, \"No toves are uffish\" must be true.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction: If $Q$ is false, then \"Every tove is uffish\" AND \"No toves are uffish\" must both be true. This is impossible, as there is at least one tove ($|T| \\ge 1$). If every tove is uffish, then it's not true that no toves are uffish. If no toves are uffish, then it's not true that every tove is uffish.\n\nTherefore, Case 2 (where $Q$ is false) is impossible.\nThis means $Q$ must be true.\n\n**Conclusion from Premises 3 and 4:**\n\nIt must be true that \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n**1. Zindle is uffish.**\n*   We know \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This tells us nothing about Zindle's uffishness. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, a rath, or something else entirely (though the problem implies everything is one of the three categories). Even if Zindle is a tove, we don't know if it's uffish. The premises only force \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle,\" not \"Every tove is uffish.\"\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n*   As derived above, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**3. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n*   This is the negation of statement 2. Since statement 2 must be true, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**4. Zindle snicker-snacked a tove.**\n*   We know \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This is a one-way relationship. It does not imply the reverse. For example, if I like every student, it doesn't mean every student likes me.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n*   This is the negation of statement 2 (or a stronger negation, as \"not all\" is different from \"none\"). Since statement 2 must be true, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**6. Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.**\n*   Similar to statement 4, this is the reverse of the established relationship. We know every tove snicker-snacked Zindle, not that Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the premises, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**2. Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**",

This means \u2200x (R(x) \u2192 G(x, Rafin)) is false.\n*   Therefore, the consequent of the inner conditional (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 G(x, Rafin))) is false.\n*   For the inner conditional (\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo) \u2192 \u2200x (R(x) \u2192 G(x, Rafin))) to be true, its antecedent (\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) must be false.\n    This means G(Zindle, Bungo) must be true.\n*   So, if the overall statement 1 is true, then (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 SS(x, Bungo))) \u2192 (G(Zindle, Bungo) is true).\n*   However, we don't have enough information to determine if G(Zindle, Bungo) is true or false, nor do we know anything about raths snicker-snacking Bungo.\n*   Since the consequent of the inner conditional is false, the inner conditional (\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo) \u2192 False) is only true if \u00acG(Zindle, Bungo) is false, i.e., G(Zindle, Bungo) is true.\n*   So, Statement 1 simplifies to: (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 SS(x, Bungo))) \u2192 G(Zindle, Bungo).\n*   We cannot deduce G(Zindle, Bungo) from the premises.

The problem states \"Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively)\". We don't know the category of Rafin or Zindle or Bungo.\n*   If Rafin is a rath, then \u2203x (R(x) \u2227 C(x, Zindle)) would be true.\n    In that case, by P5, (\u2203x (B(x) \u2227 \u00acG(x, Zindle))) would be false, meaning \u2200x (B(x) \u2192 G(x, Zindle)) would be true. This doesn't help with raths galumphing over Zindle.\n*   If Rafin is *not* a rath, then P2 (C(Rafin, Zindle)) doesn't directly tell us anything about raths chortling at Zindle.\n*   We cannot deduce whether \u2203x (R(x) \u2227 G(x, Zindle)) is true or false from the given premises.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 6: Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   Statement 1: False (cannot be determined)\n*   Statement 2: False\n*   Statement 3: False (cannot be determined)\n*   Statement 4: True\n*   Statement 5: False (cannot be determined)\n*   Statement 6: False (cannot be determined)\n\nThe only statement that must be true is Statement 4.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

We are told that everything is exclusively one of these, and there's at least one of each.\n\nLet 'C(x, y)' denote 'x chortled at y'.\nLet 'G(x, y)' denote 'x galumphed over y'.\n\nHere are the given rules:\n\n1.  **Every borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means for any b1, b2 in B, C(b1, b2) is true.\n\n2.  **Every rath chortled at every tove that chortled at it.**\n    *   For any r in R, and any t in T: if C(t, r), then C(r, t).\n\n3.  **A borogove galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it.**\n    *   There exists b in B and r in R such that G(b, r) and G(r, b).\n\n4.  **A rath galumphed over every borogove that galumphed over it.**\n    *   For any r in R, and any b in B: if G(b, r), then G(r, b).\n\n5.  **A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if Rafin chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   Let 'X' be the statement \"A borogove chortled at Zindle.\" (i.e., there exists b in B such that C(b, Zindle)).\n    *   Let 'Y' be the statement \"Rafin chortled at Bungo.\" (i.e., C(Rafin, Bungo)).\n    *   So, X <=> Y.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: There is not a borogove that every borogove chortled at.**\n*   From rule 1: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\"\n*   This means if you pick any borogove (say, b_x), then every other borogove (b_y) chortled at b_x.\n*   It also means that b_x chortled at every other borogove.\n*   So, if we pick any borogove, say 'b', then 'b' chortled at every borogove (including itself, if we interpret \"every borogove\" to include the chortler).\n*   And also, every borogove chortled at 'b'.\n*   Therefore, *every* borogove is a borogove that every borogove chortled at.\n*   This statement claims there is *not* such a borogove. This contradicts rule 1.\n*   **Statement 1 is False.**\n\n**Statement 2: No borogoves chortled at every borogove.**\n*   From rule 1: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\"\n*   This directly implies that *every* borogove chortled at every borogove.\n*   This statement claims that *no* borogoves did this. This contradicts rule 1.\n*   **Statement 2 is False.**\n\n**Statement 3: No borogoves chortled at a borogove that chortled at it.**\n*   From rule 1: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\"\n*   Let b1 and b2 be any two borogoves.\n*   Rule 1 implies C(b1, b2) and C(b2, b1).\n*   So, b1 chortled at b2, and b2 chortled at b1. This means b1 chortled at a borogove (b2) that chortled at it.\n*   This statement claims that *no* borogoves did this. This contradicts rule 1.\n*   **Statement 3 is False.**\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle is a tove.**\n*   We know: (Exists b in B such that C(b, Zindle)) <=> C(Rafin, Bungo).\n*   This statement tells us nothing about Zindle's type. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, a rath, or even something outside of these categories if the problem implies that Zindle, Rafin, and Bungo are specific named entities that may or may not be among the general \"everything\".\n*   Even if Zindle must be one of T, B, or R, we have no information to determine its type. The truth value of \"A borogove chortled at Zindle\" depends on whether Zindle is a borogove (in which case it's true by rule 1), or if it's a tove or rath and some borogove happened to chortle at it.\n*   The logical equivalence (X <=> Y) does not provide information about the type of Zindle.\n*   **Statement 4 is Not Necessarily True.**\n\n**Statement 5: No borogoves chortled at a borogove.**\n*   From rule 1: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\"\n*   This means if you pick any borogove (say, b1), then b1 chortled at every borogove (including itself, if we interpret \"every borogove\" to include the chortler).\n*   So, b1 chortled at *a* borogove (at least one, in fact, all of them).\n*   This statement claims that *no* borogoves did this. This contradicts rule 1.\n*   **Statement 5 is False.**\n\n**Statement 6: A borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n*   From rule 1: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\"\n*   This means that for any borogove b1, and any borogove b2, C(b1, b2) is true.\n*   This directly implies that if you pick *any* borogove (say, b_x), then b_x chortled at *every* borogove.\n*   Therefore, there exists a borogove (in fact, every borogove) that chortled at every borogove.\n*   **Statement 6 is True.**\n\nLet's double-check the interpretation of \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\"\nThis is a universal quantification: For all x, if x is a borogove, then for all y, if y is a borogove, then x chortled at y.\nSymbolically: $\\forall x \\in B, \\forall y \\in B, C(x, y)$.\n\nNow let's re-evaluate the statements based on this precise interpretation:\n\n1.  **There is not a borogove that every borogove chortled at.**\n    *   This means: $\\neg \\exists x \\in B, \\forall y \\in B, C(y, x)$.\n    *   Rule 1 states: $\\forall y \\in B, \\forall x \\in B, C(y, x)$.\n    *   This means that for *any* x in B, it is true that $\\forall y \\in B, C(y, x)$.\n    *   So, *every* borogove is a borogove that every borogove chortled at.\n    *   Therefore, the statement \"There is not a borogove that every borogove chortled at\" is false.\n\n2.  **No borogoves chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means: $\\neg \\exists x \\in B, \\forall y \\in B, C(x, y)$.\n    *   Rule 1 states: $\\forall x \\in B, \\forall y \\in B, C(x, y)$.\n    *   This means that for *every* x in B, it is true that $\\forall y \\in B, C(x, y)$.\n    *   So, *every* borogove chortled at every borogove.\n    *   Therefore, the statement \"No borogoves chortled at every borogove\" is false.\n\n3.  **No borogoves chortled at a borogove that chortled at it.**\n    *   This means: $\\neg \\exists x \\in B, \\exists y \\in B, (C(x, y) \\land C(y, x))$.\n    *   Rule 1 states: $\\forall x \\in B, \\forall y \\in B, C(x, y)$.\n    *   So, if we pick any x in B and any y in B, then C(x, y) is true and C(y, x) is true.\n    *   Therefore, for any x in B, there exists a y in B (namely, any y in B, including x itself) such that C(x, y) and C(y, x).\n    *   Thus, the statement \"No borogoves chortled at a borogove that chortled at it\" is false.\n\n4.  **Zindle is a tove.**\n    *   As discussed, no information supports this.\n\n5.  **No borogoves chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   This means: $\\neg \\exists x \\in B, \\exists y \\in B, C(x, y)$.\n    *   Rule 1 states: $\\forall x \\in B, \\forall y \\in B, C(x, y)$.\n    *   This means that for *every* x in B, there exists a y in B (namely, any y in B) such that C(x, y).\n    *   Therefore, the statement \"No borogoves chortled at a borogove\" is false.\n\n6.  **A borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists x \\in B, \\forall y \\in B, C(x, y)$.\n    *   Rule 1 states: $\\forall x \\in B, \\forall y \\in B, C(x, y)$.\n    *   If it's true for *all* x in B that x chortled at every y in B, then it must be true that there *exists* at least one x in B (in fact, all of them) such that x chortled at every y in B.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nThe key to this problem lies almost entirely in the first rule: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\" This is a very strong statement. It means the \"chortled at\" relationship is universal within the set of borogoves.\n\nFinal check on the galumphing rules:\nRule 3: $\\exists b \\in B, \\exists r \\in R, (G(b, r) \\land G(r, b))$.\nRule 4: $\\forall r \\",

So, (Z chortle Rafin is False) must be False, which means Z chortle Rafin is True.\n*   So the entire statement simplifies to: If (not all borogoves are mimsy), then (Zindle chortled at Rafin).\n*   We don't know if \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" is true or false.\n*   We don't know if \"Zindle chortled at Rafin\" is true or false.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if this statement must be true.\n*   **Statement 4 is NOT necessarily TRUE.**\n\n**Statement 5: A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n*   \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" is True (from given information 4).\n*   \"it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy\" means \"Zindle is mimsy\".\n*   We know \"Zindle isn't mimsy\" is True (from given information 5), so \"Zindle is mimsy\" is False.\n*   So the statement is: True BUT False.\n*   A \"but\" statement is a conjunction, so True AND False is False.\n*   **Statement 5 is FALSE.**\n\n**Statement 6: Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin unless a borogove is mimsy.**\n*   \"A unless B\" is equivalent to \"If not B, then A\".\n*   So, \"If it is not the case that a borogove is mimsy, then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.\"\n*   This is equivalent to: \"If no borogove is mimsy, then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.\"\n*   We don't know if \"no borogove is mimsy\" is true or false.\n*   We don't know if \"Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin\" is true or false.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if this statement must be true.\n*   **Statement 6 is NOT necessarily TRUE.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nOnly Statement 1 was definitively true based on the direct facts provided.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets, and their union covers everything.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Borogoves & Zindle:** Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Zindle. (\u2203b \u2208 B such that b did not snicker-snack Zindle).\n4.  **Toves & Borogoves:** There is not a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked. (\u00ac\u2203t \u2208 T such that \u2200b \u2208 B, b snicker-snacked t). This is equivalent to: \u2200t \u2208 T, \u2203b \u2208 B such that b did not snicker-snack t.\n5.  **Mimsy:** Only toves are mimsy. (If x is mimsy, then x is a tove).\n6.  **Bungo:** It is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy. (\u00ac(Bungo is not mimsy)). This means Bungo *is* mimsy.\n\n**Deductions from Given Information:**\n\n*   From (5) and (6): Since Bungo is mimsy, and only toves are mimsy, **Bungo must be a tove.** (Bungo \u2208 T).\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement based on our deductions and the given information.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nWe know Bungo is a tove. Let's use this crucial piece of information, especially in conjunction with point (4).\n\nPoint (4) states: \"There is not a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.\"\nThis can be rephrased as: \"For *every* tove, there is *at least one* borogove that did *not* snicker-snack that tove.\"\n\nSince Bungo is a tove, this rule must apply to Bungo.\n\nTherefore, for Bungo (who is a tove), there must exist at least one borogove that did not snicker-snack Bungo.\n\nThis directly translates to: **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n1.  **Every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n    *   This contradicts our deduction that \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo.\" So, this statement is **false**.\n\n2.  **Bungo snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   We know Bungo is a tove. The information given is about borogoves snicker-snacking *things*, not about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. We have no information to confirm or deny this. This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n3.  **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n    *   As derived above, this statement **must be true** because Bungo is a tove, and for every tove, there's a borogove that didn't snicker-snack it.\n\n4.  **No borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n    *   This means \"For all borogoves, that borogove did not snicker-snack Bungo.\"\n    *   Our deduction \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo\" means \"There exists at least one borogove that did not snicker-snack Bungo.\" This does *not* imply that *no* borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo. It's possible some did, and some didn't. So, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n5.  **A borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n    *   This means \"There exists at least one borogove that snicker-snacked Bungo.\"\n    *   Our deduction \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo\" means \"There exists at least one borogove that did *not* snicker-snack Bungo.\" This doesn't tell us anything about whether *any* borogoves *did* snicker-snack Bungo. It's possible none did, or some did.

No raths chortled at a rath that chortled at it.**\n    *   This means: For all x in R, for all y in R, if C(x, y) then not C(y, x).\n    *   However, we know \"Every rath chortled at every rath\". So, if x and y are raths, C(x, y) is true AND C(y, x) is true.\n    *   This statement claims that if C(x, y) is true, then C(y, x) is false. This directly contradicts our given information.\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 is **False**.\n\n**2. There is not a rath that every rath chortled at.**\n    *   This means: There does not exist a rath 'y' such that for all raths 'x', C(x, y).\n    *   From \"Every rath chortled at every rath\", we know that for any rath 'y', every rath 'x' *did* chortle at 'y'.\n    *   So, such a rath 'y' *does* exist (in fact, every rath is such a rath).\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 is **False**.\n\n**3.

Zindle will whiffle.**\n    *   We know \"Not all raths will whiffle.\" This means there is at least one rath that will not whiffle. It doesn't tell us anything about Zindle specifically. Zindle could be a rath that whiffling, a rath that isn't whiffling, a tove, or a borogove.\n    *   We also have the conditional: ZG -> (ERSB -> NTG). This doesn't directly tell us about Zindle whiffling.\n    *   We don't have enough information to determine if Zindle will whiffle.\n    *   Therefore, statement 5 is **Cannot be determined / Not necessarily true**.\n\n**6. A rath chortled at every rath.**\n    *   This means: There exists a rath 'x' such that for all raths 'y', C(x, y).\n    *   From \"Every rath chortled at every rath\", we know that *every* rath 'x' chortled at *every* rath 'y'.\n    *   Since \"every\" implies \"at least one\", this statement must be true. For example, pick any rath (we know there's at least one). That rath chortled at every rath.\n    *   Therefore, statement 6 is **True**.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding \"Every rath chortled at every rath.\" This is a universal affirmative statement.\n\n*   If A is a rath and B is a rath, then A chortled at B.\n*   If A is a rath, then A chortled at A.\n*   If A is a rath, then A chortled at every other rath.\n*   If B is a rath, then every rath chortled at B.\n\nStatement 6: \"A rath chortled at every rath.\"\nThis means: $\\exists x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, C(x,y)$.\nOur given information states: $\\forall x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, C(x,y)$.\nIf something is true for *all* x, it must be true for *at least one* x.

(This means if X is a tove, X did not chortle at Rafin).\n5.  **Borogoves & Gyring:** Only borogoves gyred. (This means if X gyred, then X is a borogove).\n6.  **Raths & Zindle:** Every rath chortled at Zindle. (This means if X is a rath, X chortled at Zindle).\n7.  **Rafin & Bungo:** It is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo. (This is a double negative. \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is false. Therefore, Rafin *did* chortle at Bungo).\n\n**Analyzing Each Statement:**\n\n**Statement 1: Zindle and Bungo will burble.**\n\n*   From point 3, we know Zindle will burble.\n*   We have no information about whether Bungo will burble. The information about Bungo is only related to Rafin chortling at Bungo.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: A rath chortled at Zindle only if a tove chortled at Rafin.**\n\n*   This statement can be rephrased as: \"If a rath chortled at Zindle, then a tove chortled at Rafin.\"\n*   From point 6, we know \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" This means it *is* true that \"a rath chortled at Zindle\" (since there's at least one rath, and all of them chortled at Zindle).\n*   From point 4, we know \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This means it *is not* true that \"a tove chortled at Rafin.\"\n*   So, the statement becomes: \"If (True), then (False).\"\n*   A true premise leading to a false conclusion makes the entire conditional statement false.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\n**Statement 3: No toves chortled at Rafin and every rath chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   From point 4, \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" is explicitly stated as true.\n*   From point 6, \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" is explicitly stated as true.\n*   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire conjunction is true.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 4: Rafin and Bungo will burble.**\n\n*   From point 3, we know Rafin will burble.\n*   We have no information about whether Bungo will burble. The information about Bungo is only related to Rafin chortling at Bungo.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: If a rath chortled at Zindle, then a tove chortled at Rafin.**\n\n*   This is the same as Statement 2.\n*   From point 6, \"a rath chortled at Zindle\" is true.\n*   From point 4, \"a tove chortled at Rafin\" is false.\n*   So, the statement is \"If (True), then (False)\", which is false.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\n**Statement 6: Zindle won't burble.**\n\n*   From point 3, we are explicitly told that \"Zindle will burble.\"\n*   Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

Zindle must be one of these.\n\n*   **Case 1: Zindle is a Rath (R(Zindle))**\n    If Zindle is a rath, and Zindle isn't beamish (\u00acBeamish(Zindle)), then it is NOT true that \"every rath is beamish\" (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))).\n    Therefore, the antecedent of the implication in Conditional 1's consequent, (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))), is false.\n    If the antecedent is false, the entire implication (False \u2192 Q) is true.\n    So, if Zindle is a rath, then [ (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) ] is true, regardless of the truth of (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))). This doesn't lead to a contradiction yet.\n\n*   **Case 2: Zindle is a Borogove (B(Zindle))**\n    If Zindle is a borogove, then from point 6, \"No borogoves will whiffle\" (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 \u00acWhiffle(y))), it must be that Zindle won't whiffle (\u00acWhiffle(Zindle)).\n    This contradicts our initial assumption that Zindle will whiffle (Whiffle(Zindle)).\n    Therefore, Zindle cannot be a borogove.\n\n*   **Case 3: Zindle is a Tove (T(Zindle))**\n    If Zindle is a tove, then point 6 (\"No borogoves will whiffle\") doesn't directly apply to Zindle.\n    If Whiffle(Zindle) is true, then [ (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) ] must be true.\n    We don't have enough information to determine the truth of (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) or (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) if Zindle is a tove.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the assumption that Whiffle(Zindle) is true.\n\nIf Whiffle(Zindle) is true, then:\n[ (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) ] is true.\n\nWe know:\n*   \u00acBeamish(Zindle)\n*   Chortled(Bungo, Zindle)\n*   \u2200y (B(y) \u2192 \u00acWhiffle(y))\n\nFrom \u2200y (B(y) \u2192 \u00acWhiffle(y)), if Zindle were a borogove, then \u00acWhiffle(Zindle) would be true. This contradicts our assumption that Whiffle(Zindle) is true.\nTherefore, Zindle cannot be a borogove.\n\nSo, Zindle must be either a tove or a rath.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Zindle will whiffle (Whiffle(Zindle)).\nIf Whiffle(Zindle) is true, then the conditional [ (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) ] must be true.\n\nWe know \u00acBeamish(Zindle).\nIf Zindle is a rath (R(Zindle)), then it is not true that \"every rath is beamish\" (\u00ac\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))).\nIn this case, the antecedent (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) is false.\nA false antecedent makes the entire implication true (False \u2192 Q is True).\nSo, if Zindle is a rath, then Whiffle(Zindle) being true is consistent with the conditional.\n\nWhat if Zindle is a tove (T(Zindle))?\nIf Zindle is a tove, then \u00acBeamish(Zindle) is still true.\nThe conditional [ (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) ] must be true.\nWe don't know if (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) is true or false.\nWe don't know if (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) is true or false.\n\nLet's re-examine the structure of the problem. We are looking for statements that *must* be true.\n\nConsider the statement \"Zindle won't whiffle\" (\u00acWhiffle(Zindle)).\nLet's assume \u00acWhiffle(Zindle) is false, meaning Whiffle(Zindle) is true.\n\nIf Whiffle(Zindle) is true:\n1.  From (6) \"No borogoves will whiffle\", Zindle cannot be a borogove. (If Zindle were a borogove, then \u00acWhiffle(Zindle) would be true, contradicting our assumption).\n2.  So, Zindle is either a tove or a rath.\n3.  From (4) \"If Zindle will whiffle, then (every rath is beamish only if every borogove chortled at Bungo)\", we have:\n    (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) must be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of Zindle being a rath or a tove, given Whiffle(Zindle) is true.\n\n*   **Scenario A: Zindle is a Rath (R(Zindle))**\n    *   We know \u00acBeamish(Zindle) (from 3).\n    *   Since Zindle is a rath and not beamish, it is *not* true that \"every rath is beamish\" (\u00ac\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))).\n    *   This means the antecedent of the implication in (4) is false.\n    *   (False \u2192 Q) is always true. So, the conditional in (4) holds.\n    *   This scenario (Zindle is a rath and Whiffle(Zindle) is true) is consistent with all given information.\n\n*   **Scenario B: Zindle is a Tove (T(Zindle))**\n    *   We know \u00acBeamish(Zindle) (from 3).\n    *   If Whiffle(Zindle) is true, then (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) must be true.\n    *   We don't have any information that forces a contradiction here. For example, it could be that \"every rath is beamish\" is false (e.g., there's a rath that isn't beamish, but it's not Zindle), making the conditional true. Or it could be that \"every rath is beamish\" is true, and \"every borogove chortled at Bungo\" is also true.\n\nSince we found a consistent scenario where Whiffle(Zindle) is true (Scenario A: Zindle is a rath, Zindle isn't beamish, Zindle will whiffle), then the statement \"Zindle won't whiffle\" (\u00acWhiffle(Zindle)) is not necessarily true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. The key is \"must be true\".\n\nLet's assume Zindle will whiffle (Whiffle(Zindle)).\nFrom (6), \"No borogoves will whiffle\", Zindle cannot be a borogove.\nSo Zindle is either a tove or a rath.\n\nFrom (3), Zindle isn't beamish (\u00acBeamish(Zindle)).\n\nFrom (4), if Whiffle(Zindle), then [ (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) ].\nSince we assume Whiffle(Zindle), then [ (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) ] must be true.\n\nNow, consider the term (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))).\nIf Zindle is a rath (R(Zindle)), then since \u00acBeamish(Zindle), it means that (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) is false.\nIf (\u2200x (R(x) \u2192 Beamish(x))) is false, then the implication [ (False) \u2192 (\u2200y (B(y) \u2192 Chortled(y, Bungo))) ] is true, regardless of the consequent.\nSo, if Zindle is a rath, then Whiffle(Zindle) is consistent with all the premises.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle won't",

It means that for any individual that is a rath, that individual chortled at Zindle.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this crucial piece of information:\n\n*   **1. Zindle is a tove.**\n    *   We know that every rath chortled at Zindle. This tells us something about the *relationship* between raths and Zindle, but it doesn't tell us what *type* Zindle is. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. There's no information to definitively classify Zindle.\n    *   *Must be true? No.*\n\n*   **2. No raths chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   This directly contradicts point 4, which states \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   *Must be true? No. In fact, it must be false.*\n\n*   **3. A rath chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   Since we know \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" (point 4), and we are told there is \"at least one of each\" (meaning there is at least one rath), it logically follows that *at least one* rath chortled at Zindle. If every single rath did it, then certainly *a* rath did it.\n    *   *Must be true? Yes.*\n\n*   **4. Not all raths chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   This directly contradicts point 4, which states \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" \"Every\" means \"all.\"\n    *   *Must be true? No. In fact, it must be false.*\n\n*   **5. Zindle chortled at every rath.**\n    *   We know \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" This is a one-way relationship (rath -> Zindle). It does *not* imply the reverse (Zindle -> rath). Zindle might or might not have chortled at any rath, let alone every rath.\n    *   *Must be true? No.*\n\n*   **6. Zindle chortled at a rath.**\n    *   Similar to statement 5, this is the reverse direction of the known relationship. We only know rath -> Zindle. We don't know Zindle -> rath.\n    *   *Must be true? No.*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct statement \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" and the fact that there is at least one rath, only statement 3 logically follows.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This is equivalent to saying \"It is not the case that a tove chortled at Rafin.\"\n\nLet's use formal logic for clarity:\nLet $C(x, y)$ be \"x chortled at y\".\nLet $T(x)$ be \"x is a tove\".\nStatement (3) is: $\\forall x (T(x) \\rightarrow \\neg C(x, \\text{Rafin}))$.\nThis is equivalent to: $\\neg \\exists x (T(x) \\land C(x, \\text{Rafin}))$.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n*   **1. A tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This is $\\exists x (T(x) \\land C(x, \\text{Rafin}))$.\n    *   This directly contradicts statement (3) which says \"No toves chortled at Rafin\".\n    *   Therefore, statement (1) must be **false**.\n\n*   **2. Every tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This is $\\forall x (T(x) \\rightarrow C(x, \\text{Rafin}))$.\n    *   This also directly contradicts statement (3).

We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n    *   Therefore, statement (4) is **undetermined**.\n\n*   **5. No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n    *   We know \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" is true from statement (3) of the given information.\n    *   We also know that \"Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively)\".\n    *   If Rafin were a tove, then \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" would imply that Rafin did not chortle at Rafin. This is consistent.\n    *   However, the problem doesn't state what Rafin is. Rafin could be a tove, a borogove, a rath, or something else entirely (though the initial premise \"Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath\" suggests Rafin must be one of them).\n    *   If Rafin is a tove, then \"Rafin isn't a tove\" would be false, making the entire conjunction false.\n    *   If Rafin is a borogove or a rath, then \"Rafin isn't a tove\" would be true, making the entire conjunction true (since \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" is true).\n    *   Since we don't know what Rafin is, we cannot definitively say \"Rafin isn't a tove\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, statement (5) is **undetermined**.\n\n*   **6. Rafin chortled at every tove.**\n    *   This is $\\forall x (T(x) \\rightarrow C(\\text{Rafin}, x))$.\n    *   Similar to statement (4), we have no information about Rafin chortling at toves.\n    *   Therefore, statement (6) is **undetermined**.\n\n**Revisiting the implications of the given rules:**\n\n*   **Rule 5: Every tove chortled at Bungo only if a tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   Let P = \"Every tove chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   Let Q = \"A tove chortled at Rafin.\"\n    *   The rule is P -> Q.\n    *   We established that Q (\"A tove chortled at Rafin\") is false based on \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\"\n    *   If Q is false, then for P -> Q to be true, P must also be false.\n    *   So, \"Every tove chortled at Bungo\" must be false. This means \"Not every tove chortled at Bungo\" or \"At least one tove did not chortle at Bungo.\" This is an interesting deduction but doesn't help with the given options.\n\n*   **Rule 6: If not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   Let S = \"All borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n    *   Let C = \"All toves chortled at Rafin.\"\n    *   The rule is (not S) -> (not C).\n    *   We established that \"All toves chortled at Rafin\" (C) is false.\n    *   Therefore, \"not C\" is true.\n    *   Since (not S) -> (not C) is true, and (not C) is true, this implication gives us no information about (not S). (If the consequent is true, the implication is true regardless of the antecedent).\n    *   So, we cannot deduce anything about borogoves snicker-snacking Rafin from this rule.\n\nThe crucial piece of information is \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This directly negates options 1 and 2, and directly supports option 3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This means if something is a borogove, it will not whiffle.\n\nFrom (3):\n*   $G(\\text{Rafin})$ (Rafin gimbled).\n*   $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg W(t)$ (Not all toves will whiffle, meaning at least one tove will not whiffle).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to be Checked:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on our derived facts.\n\n**Statement 1: Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n*   Let $M(x)$ be \"$x$ is mimsy\".\n*   The statement is: $(\\forall b \\in B, M(b)) \\iff \\neg (\\forall b \\in B, M(b))$.\n*   Let $P$ be the proposition \"Every borogove is mimsy\" ($\\forall b \\in B, M(b)$).\n*   The statement becomes $P \\iff \\neg P$.\n*   A biconditional $P \\iff Q$ is true if and only if $P$ and $Q$ have the same truth value.\n*   Here, $Q = \\neg P$. So, $P \\iff \\neg P$ is true if and only if $P$ and $\\neg P$ have the same truth value.\n*   This is impossible, as $P$ and $\\neg P$ always have opposite truth values.\n*   Therefore, the statement \"Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy\" is a logical contradiction. It can never be true.\n*   **Conclusion for Statement 1: Must be False.**\n\n**Statement 2: Zindle will whiffle.**\n*   We know $\\forall b \\in B, \\neg W(b)$ (no borogoves whiffle).\n*   We know $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg W(t)$ (at least one tove doesn't whiffle).\n*   We don't know if Zindle is a tove, borogove, or rath.\n*   If Zindle is a borogove, then Zindle will not whiffle.\n*   If Zindle is a tove or a rath, Zindle *could* whiffle or *could not* whiffle.\n*   There is no information that forces Zindle to whiffle.\n*   **Conclusion for Statement 2: Not necessarily True.**\n\n**Statement 3: Rafin gimbled and only borogoves will whiffle.**\n*   From (3), we know $G(\\text{Rafin})$ (Rafin gimbled). So the first part is true.\n*   The second part is \"only borogoves will whiffle\". This means: $\\forall x, W(x) \\implies x \\in B$.\n*   From (4), we know $\\forall b \\in B, \\neg W(b)$ (no borogoves will whiffle).\n*   If no borogoves will whiffle, then it's impossible for *only* borogoves to whiffle, because nothing that is a borogove will whiffle.\n*   In fact, if no borogoves whiffle, then \"only borogoves will whiffle\" implies that nothing at all will whiffle (because if something whiffles, it must be a borogove, but borogoves don't whiffle).\n*   So, \"only borogoves will whiffle\" combined with \"no borogoves will whiffle\" implies \"nothing will whiffle\".\n*   However, we have no information that forces \"nothing will whiffle\" to be true. For example, a rath could whiffle.\n*   More directly, the statement \"only borogoves will whiffle\" means that if something whiffles, it must be a borogove. But we know that borogoves *don't* whiffle. This means that if anything whiffles, it must be a borogove that doesn't whiffle, which is a contradiction. Therefore, \"only borogoves will whiffle\" implies that *nothing* will whiffle.\n*   Is it true that nothing will whiffle? We don't know. We know at least one tove *doesn't* whiffle, but other toves *could* whiffle. Rath's *could* whiffle.\n*   The statement \"only borogoves will whiffle\" is false because borogoves don't whiffle. If something whiffles, it cannot be a borogove. Therefore, it cannot be true that *only* borogoves whiffle.\n*   Since the second part of the conjunction is false, the entire conjunction is false.\n*   **Conclusion for Statement 3: Must be False.**\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n*   From (4), we know $\\neg W(\\text{Bungo})$ (Bungo will not whiffle).\n*   Since Bungo will not whiffle, the conjunction \"Zindle will whiffle AND Bungo will whiffle\" must be false.\n*   **Conclusion for Statement 4: Must be False.**\n\n**Statement 5: Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n*   We know nothing about Zindle whiffing (as seen in Statement 2).\n*   We know nothing about Rafin whiffing. Rafin is not stated to be a tove, borogove, or rath. Even if Rafin were a tove, we only know *not all* toves whiffle, not that Rafin specifically does or doesn't. If Rafin were a borogove, Rafin would not whiffle.\n*   There is no information that forces both Zindle and Rafin to whiffle.\n*   **Conclusion for Statement 5: Not necessarily True.**\n\n**Statement 6: Rafin gimbled and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n*   From (3), we know $G(\\text{Rafin})$ (Rafin gimbled). This part is true.\n*   From (4), we know $\\forall b \\in B, \\neg W(b)$ (no borogoves will whiffle). This part is true.\n*   Since both conjuncts are true based on the given information, the entire statement must be true.\n*   **Conclusion for Statement 6: Must be True.**\n\nFinal check:\nStatement 1: Contradiction, so False.\nStatement 2: Not enough info, could be false (e.g., if Zindle is a borogove).\nStatement 3: \"only borogoves will whiffle\" is false because borogoves don't whiffle. So the conjunction is false.\nStatement 4: Bungo doesn't whiffle, so the conjunction is false.\nStatement 5: Not enough info.\nStatement 6: Both parts are directly stated or directly derivable from the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

For example, if T1 galumphed over T2, T2 over T3, etc., but no single tove galumphed over all others, then statement 1 would be false.\n\n**Statement 2: No toves galumphed over every tove.**\n*   This means: $\\neg (\\exists T_1 \\forall T_2, G(T_1, T_2))$. This is equivalent to $\\forall T_1 \\exists T_2, \\neg G(T_1, T_2)$.\n*   This means for every tove, there's at least one tove it *didn't* galumph over.\n*   Again, we have no information to confirm or deny this. It's the negation of Statement 1. If Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, and vice-versa. Since we can't prove Statement 1, we can't prove Statement 2 either.\n\n**Statement 3: There is a tove that every tove galumphed over.**\n*   This means: $\\exists T_1 \\forall T_2, G(T_2, T_1)$.\n*   This is the \"universal target\" scenario. There's one tove that was galumphed over by all other toves.\n*   We have no information to confirm or deny this. The given information (3) is about what toves *do* (they galumph over *a* tove), not what happens *to* them.\n\n**Statement 4: Every tove galumphed over every tove.**\n*   This means: $\\forall T_1 \\forall T_2, G(T_1, T_2)$.\n*   This is a very strong statement. It implies that every tove galumphed over itself, and every tove galumphed over every other tove.\n*   The given information (3) is \"Every tove galumphed over *a* tove.\" This is much weaker. It only guarantees that for any given tove, there's *at least one* tove it galumphed over. It doesn't say it galumphed over *all* of them.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true. For example, if T1 galumphed over T2, but T1 did not galumph over T3, then this statement would be false.\n\n**Statement 5: A tove galumphed over a tove.**\n*   This means: $\\exists T_1 \\exists T_2, G(T_1, T_2)$.\n*   From the given information (3): \"Every tove galumphed over a tove.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one tove (from given information 2), let's call it T_A.\n    *   According to information (3), T_A galumphed over *a* tove (let's call it T_B).\n    *   Therefore, there exists a tove (T_A) that galumphed over a tove (T_B).\n*   This statement *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 6: No toves galumphed over a tove.**\n*   This means: $\\neg (\\exists T_1 \\exists T_2, G(T_1, T_2))$. This is equivalent to $\\forall T_1 \\forall T_2, \\neg G(T_1, T_2)$.\n*   This means no tove galumphed over any tove.\n*   This directly contradicts Statement 5. Since Statement 5 must be true, Statement 6 must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Statement 5 is necessarily true based on the given information. The information about raths and mimsy, and Bungo/Zindle, and whiffling, is not relevant to the relationships between toves and their galumphing. The crucial pieces of information are:\n*   There is at least one tove.\n*   Every tove galumphed over a tove.\n\nIf there's at least one tove, and every tove galumphed over *a* tove, then that \"at least one tove\" must have galumphed over *a* tove. This directly implies that \"a tove galumphed over a tove.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Bungo:** Bungo is a borogove (Bungo $\\in$ B).\n*   **Toves & Chortling:**\n    *   No toves chortled at Rafin. (For any t $\\in$ T, t did not chortle at Rafin).\n    *   No toves chortled at Bungo. (For any t $\\in$ T, t did not chortle at Bungo).\n*   **Raths & Snicker-snacking Rafin:** Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin (RSR) only if not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin ($\\neg \\forall$ RSR).\n    *   Let P be \"Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\" ($\\forall$ r $\\in$ R, r snicker-snacked Rafin).\n    *   The statement is P $\\implies \\neg$ P.\n    *   If P is true, then $\\neg$ P must also be true, which is a contradiction. Therefore, P must be false.\n    *   This means: **It is NOT true that every rath snicker-snacked Rafin.** (i.e., $\\neg \\forall$ r $\\in$ R, r snicker-snacked Rafin, which implies $\\exists$ r $\\in$ R such that r did not snicker-snack Rafin).\n*   **Borogoves & Raths & Bungo:** If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin (BSR), then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo (RSB) only if Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo ($\\neg$ BSB).\n    *   Let Q be \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" ($\\exists$ b $\\in$ B, b snicker-snacked Rafin).\n    *   Let S be \"Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\" ($\\forall$ r $\\in$ R, r snicker-snacked Bungo).\n    *   Let U be \"Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo\" ($\\neg$ Bungo snicker-snacked Bungo).\n    *   The statement is Q $\\implies$ (S $\\implies$ U).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to be Evaluated:**\n\nWe are looking for statements that *must* be true. Let's focus on the \"Toves & Chortling\" information, as the options are all about toves and borogoves chortling.\n\nFrom the given information:\n*   \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\" This means for any tove 't', 't' did not chortle at Bungo.\n*   Since Bungo is a borogove, this implies that **no toves chortled at *that specific borogove* (Bungo).**\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n1.  **Every tove chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   This means for every tove 't', there exists *some* borogove 'b' such that 't' chortled at 'b'.\n    *   We know no toves chortled at Bungo. But there could be other borogoves.\n    *   Does the information force every tove to chortle at *some* borogove? No. The given information only tells us about chortling at Rafin and Bungo. It doesn't provide any general rule about toves chortling at borogoves. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **Every tove chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means for every tove 't' and every borogove 'b', 't' chortled at 'b'.\n    *   We know \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\" Since Bungo is a borogove, this directly contradicts \"Every tove chortled at every borogove.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n3.  **No toves chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   This means for every tove 't' and every borogove 'b', 't' did not chortle at 'b'.\n    *   We know \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\" This is consistent with this statement.\n    *   Does the information *force* this to be true for *all* borogoves?\n    *   The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\" This means for any tove 't', t did not chortle at Bungo.\n    *   This statement claims that for *any* tove 't' and *any* borogove 'b', 't' did not chortle at 'b'.\n    *   The given information only specifies Bungo. It doesn't say anything about other borogoves. It's possible there's another borogove, say \"Flumph\", and some tove chortled at Flumph.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **No toves chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means it is NOT true that \"A tove chortled at every borogove.\" (i.e., $\\neg \\exists$ t $\\in$ T such that $\\forall$ b $\\in$ B, t chortled at b).\n    *   Alternatively, for every tove 't', there exists at least one borogove 'b' such that 't' did not chortle at 'b'.\n    *   We know \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   Let 't' be any tove. We know 't' did not chortle at Bungo (which is a borogove).\n    *   So, for any tove 't', we can identify Bungo as a borogove that 't' did not chortle at.\n    *   This means that for every tove, there is at least one borogove (Bungo) that it did not chortle at.\n    *   Therefore, it is impossible for any tove to have chortled at *every* borogove.\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n5.  **A tove chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one tove 't' such that for every borogove 'b', 't' chortled at 'b'.\n    *   We know \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   If there were such a tove 't', then 't' would have to chortle at Bungo. But we know no toves chortled at Bungo.\n    *   This statement directly contradicts \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n6.  **A tove chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one tove 't' and at least one borogove 'b' such that 't' chortled at 'b'.\n    *   We know \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\" This means Bungo cannot be that 'b'.\n    *   Does the information force this to be true? No. It's possible that no tove chortled at any borogove. The information only restricts chortling at Bungo.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let T be the set of toves, B be the set of borogoves, and R be the set of raths.\nThe problem states that these three sets are exclusive and exhaustive, meaning every entity is exactly one of these types.\nAlso, there is at least one of each type, so $|T| \\ge 1$, $|B| \\ge 1$, $|R| \\ge 1$.\nLet $S(x, y)$ denote \"x snicker-snacked y\".\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1. Every rath snicker-snacked every tove.\n   This can be written as: $\\forall r \\in R, \\forall t \\in T, S(r, t)$.\n\n2. A borogove snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked a tove.\n   This can be written as: $\\exists b_1 \\in B, \\exists b_2 \\in B \\text{ such that } S(b_1, b_2) \\text{ and } S(b_2, t_0) \\text{ for some } t_0 \\in T$.\n\n3. Zindle snicker-snacked a tove.\n   Let Z be Zindle. So, $S(Z, t_1)$ for some $t_1 \\in T$.\n   The problem does not state what type Zindle is. Zindle could be a tove, borogove, or rath, or none of these (if Zindle is not \"everything\"). However, the statements to evaluate are about toves, raths, and their snicker-snacking relationships. Zindle's information seems to be a distractor for the given options.\n\nLet's analyze the given statements based on the information:\n\nFrom statement 1: $\\forall r \\in R, \\forall t \\in T, S(r, t)$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n**1. Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   This means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, S(t, r)$.\n   We only know about raths snicker-snacking toves, not the other way around. This statement is not necessarily true. For example, if there is a tove $t_x$ that didn't snicker-snack any rath, this statement would be false. The given information does not provide any basis to conclude this.\n\n**2. There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(r, t)$.\n   This is directly implied by the given information 1: \"Every rath snicker-snacked every tove.\" If every rath snicker-snacked *every* tove, then for any specific tove $t_0$, every rath must have snicker-snacked $t_0$. Since we know there is at least one tove ($|T| \\ge 1$), let $t_0$ be any tove. Then, by the given information, every rath snicker-snacked $t_0$. So, there exists a tove (in fact, every tove) that every rath snicker-snacked. This statement must be true.\n\n**3. No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   This means: $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(t, r))$.\n   This is equivalent to: $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, \\neg S(t, r)$.\n   We have no information about toves snicker-snacking raths. This statement is not necessarily true. It's possible that some tove *did* snicker-snack every rath.\n\n**4. A tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(t, r)$.\n   This is the negation of statement 3. As with statement 3, we have no information to confirm or deny this. It's not necessarily true.\n\n**5. A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, S(t, r)$.\n   Again, we only know about raths snicker-snacking toves. We don't know if any tove snicker-snacked any rath. This is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   This means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(t, r)$.\n   This is a very strong statement. We only know the reverse: every rath snicker-snacked every tove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nLet's re-examine statement 2 carefully.\nGiven: $\\forall r \\in R, \\forall t \\in T, S(r, t)$.\nStatement 2: $\\exists t_0 \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(r, t_0)$.\nSince $|T| \\ge 1$, let $t_0$ be any arbitrary tove from the set T.\nAccording to the given information \"Every rath snicker-snacked every tove\", it means that for this specific $t_0$, every rath $r \\in R$ snicker-snacked $t_0$.\nSo, $\\forall r \\in R, S(r, t_0)$ is true for any $t_0 \\in T$.\nSince there is at least one tove, we can pick one, say $t^*$. Then, for this $t^*$, it is true that every rath snicker-snacked $t^*$.\nTherefore, \"There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked\" must be true.\n\nThe information about borogoves and Zindle is not relevant to the truth of statement 2.\n\nFinal check:\nThe core information is \"Every rath snicker-snacked every tove.\"\nLet $R = \\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_m\\}$ and $T = \\{t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_n\\}$, where $m \\ge 1$ and $n \\ge 1$.\nThe given statement means:\n$S(r_1, t_1), S(r_1, t_2), \\dots, S(r_1, t_n)$\n$S(r_2, t_1), S(r_2, t_2), \\dots, S(r_2, t_n)$\n...\n$S(r_m, t_1), S(r_m, t_2), \\dots, S(r_m, t_n)$\n\nNow consider statement 2: \"There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked.\"\nThis means $\\exists t_j \\in T$ such that $S(r_i, t_j)$ for all $r_i \\in R$.\nFrom the list above, pick any $t_j$ (e.g., $t_1$).\nIs it true that $S(r_i, t_1)$ for all $r_i \\in R$? Yes, it is true from the first column of the list.\nSince there is at least one tove ($n \\ge 1$), we can always pick such a $t_j$.\nSo, statement 2 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

There is not a borogove that every tove chortled at.**\n    *   This means: $\\neg (\\exists b \\in B, \\forall t \\in T, \\text{Chortled}(t, b))$.\n    *   From given information #2, we know $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\neg \\text{Chortled}(t, b)$.\n    *   If no tove chortled at any borogove, then it's certainly true that there isn't a borogove that *every* tove chortled at. This statement must be true.\n\n**2. Every tove chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\text{Chortled}(t, b)$.\n    *   This directly contradicts given information #2, which states $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\neg \\text{Chortled}(t, b)$.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**3. Every tove chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, \\text{Chortled}(t, b)$.\n    *   This also contradicts given information #2. If no tove chortled at any borogove, then it's impossible for every tove to have chortled at *a* borogove.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**4. A tove chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, \\text{Chortled}(t, b)$.\n    *   This directly contradicts given information #2.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**5. A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.**\n    *   This statement is a logical contradiction within itself: $(\\exists b \\in B, \\text{Burble}(b)) \\land (\\forall b \\in B, \\neg \\text{Burble}(b))$.\n    *   A statement that is a contradiction cannot be true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**6. A tove chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\text{Chortled}(t, b)$.\n    *   This also contradicts given information #2. If no tove chortled at any borogove, then there cannot be a tove that chortled at *every* borogove.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means T, B, and R form a partition of all things.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Mimsy Borogoves:** Every borogove is mimsy. (B $\\implies$ M)\n4.  **Chortling (Tove-Borogove):** A borogove chortled at every tove that chortled at it. Let C(x, y) mean x chortled at y. So, if T is a tove and B is a borogove, and C(T, B), then C(B, T).\n5.  **Bungo's Snicker-Snack:** If not all toves chortled at Bungo (\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, C(t, Bungo)), then Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo (\u00acSS(Bungo, Bungo)) only if every borogove chortled at Bungo (\u2200b\u2208B, C(b, Bungo)).\n    This can be written as: (\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, C(t, Bungo)) $\\implies$ [\u00acSS(Bungo, Bungo) $\\implies$ (\u2200b\u2208B, C(b, Bungo))]\n\n**Analysis of the \"Mimsy\" property:**\n\nFrom statement 3, \"Every borogove is mimsy,\" we can directly deduce information about mimsy borogoves.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **1. No borogoves are mimsy.**\n    This directly contradicts statement 3 (\"Every borogove is mimsy\"). So, this is **false**.\n\n*   **2. Bungo is mimsy.**\n    We don't know what Bungo is (a tove, borogove, or rath). If Bungo is a borogove, then Bungo is mimsy. If Bungo is a tove or a rath, we have no information about whether it's mimsy. Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **3. Not all borogoves are mimsy if and only if a borogove is mimsy.**\n    Let's analyze this biconditional:\n    *   **Part 1: (Not all borogoves are mimsy) $\\implies$ (A borogove is mimsy)**\n        From statement 3, \"Every borogove is mimsy.\" This means it's *not* true that \"Not all borogoves are mimsy.\" So, the antecedent (Not all borogoves are mimsy) is false. A false antecedent makes an implication true. So, this direction is true.\n    *   **Part 2: (A borogove is mimsy) $\\implies$ (Not all borogoves are mimsy)**\n        From statement 3, \"Every borogove is mimsy.\" This means \"A borogove is mimsy\" is true. However, \"Not all borogoves are mimsy\" is false (because *all* are mimsy). So, (True $\\implies$ False) is false.\n    Since one part of the biconditional is false, the entire statement is **false**.\n\n*   **4. Only borogoves are mimsy.**\n    This means if something is mimsy, it must be a borogove (M $\\implies$ B). We know that every borogove is mimsy (B $\\implies$ M). However, we have no information about whether toves or raths can be mimsy. For example, a tove could be mimsy. If a tove is mimsy, then \"Only borogoves are mimsy\" would be false. We cannot conclude this from the given information. So, this is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **5. Not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n    This directly contradicts statement 3 (\"Every borogove is mimsy\"). So, this is **false**.\n\n*   **6. A borogove is mimsy.**\n    Statement 3 says \"Every borogove is mimsy.\" If every borogove is mimsy, then it logically follows that at least one borogove is mimsy (since we are told there's at least one borogove). So, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct implication of \"Every borogove is mimsy\" and the existence of at least one borogove, only statement 6 must be true. The information about chortling and Bungo is not needed to answer this specific question about mimsy borogoves.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets, and their union covers everything.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Uffishness:** Bungo (Bu) and Zindle (Zi) are uffish (U). So, U(Bu) and U(Zi) are true.\n4.  **Toves & Zindle:** Not all toves snicker-snacked (SS) Zindle. This means $\\exists t \\in T$ such that $\\neg SS(t, Zi)$.\n5.  **Raths, Borogoves, Toves:** Every rath snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked every tove.\n    Formally: $\\forall r \\in R, \\forall b \\in B, \\forall t \\in T: (SS(b, t) \\implies SS(r, b))$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\n**Statement 1: Zindle is a tove.**\n*   We know Zindle is uffish. We know Zindle is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n*   The given information does not provide any direct or indirect link to determine Zindle's category. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 2: Zindle isn't a tove.**\n*   Similar to Statement 1, we have no information to confirm or deny Zindle's category. Zindle could be a tove.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Bungo is uffish just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n*   \"Bungo is uffish just in case X\" means $U(Bu) \\iff X$.\n*   We are given that Bungo *is* uffish ($U(Bu)$ is true).\n*   So, for this statement to be true, \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" must be true.\n*   \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" means $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg SS(t, Zi)$.\n*   However, we are given \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle,\" which means $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg SS(t, Zi)$. This is *not* the same as \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" \"Not all\" allows for *some* toves to have snicker-snacked Zindle.\n*   Since $U(Bu)$ is true, this statement would only be true if \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" were also true. But we only know \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 4: Bungo is uffish just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n*   \"Bungo is uffish just in case X\" means $U(Bu) \\iff X$.\n*   We are given that Bungo *is* uffish ($U(Bu)$ is true).\n*   We are also given that \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true.\n*   So, we have (True) $\\iff$ (True), which is true.\n*   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Bungo isn't uffish.**\n*   We are explicitly given that \"Bungo and Zindle are uffish.\"\n*   Therefore, this statement is false and cannot *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Zindle isn't uffish.**\n*   We are explicitly given that \"Bungo and Zindle are uffish.\"\n*   Therefore, this statement is false and cannot *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

In this case, R1 did not snicker-snack R1 (unless specified, and it's not implied by the rule), and R2 did not snicker-snack R2. Neither R1 nor R2 snicker-snacked *every* rath (they only snicker-snacked one other rath).\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This means for any two raths X and Y (including X=Y), X snicker-snacked Y.\n    *   The given rule states that *every* rath snicker-snacked *a* rath (that snicker-snacked it). It does not imply that every rath snicker-snacked *every* rath.\n    *   Again, consider R1 and R2 where R1 snicker-snacked R2 and R2 snicker-snacked R1. This satisfies the rule. But R1 did not snicker-snack R1 (unless specified), and R2 did not snicker-snack R2. So, it's not true that *every* rath snicker-snacked *every* rath.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **No raths snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 1.\n    *   Since statement 1 (\"A rath snicker-snacked a rath\") must be true, its negation (\"No raths snicker-snacked a rath\") must be false.\n    *   This statement is not true.\n\n5.  **No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 2.\n    *   Since statement 2 (\"A rath snicker-snacked every rath\") is not necessarily true, its negation (\"No raths snicker-snacked every rath\") is not necessarily true either. It could be true, or it could be false depending on the specific configuration of raths.\n    *   For example, if there's only one rath, R1. The rule says R1 snicker-snacked a rath (Y) that snicker-snacked R1. If Y must be R1 itself, then R1 snicker-snacked R1. In this case, R1 snicker-snacked *every* rath (since R1 is the only rath). So statement 2 would be true, and statement 5 would be false.\n    *   If there are multiple raths, and none of them snicker-snacked every other rath, then statement 5 would be true.\n    *   Since we can't definitively say it must be true, it's not the answer.\n\n6.  **There is a rath that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n    *   This means there exists a specific rath (let's call it RathZ) such that for every rath X, X snicker-snacked RathZ.\n    *   The given rule states that *every* rath X snicker-snacked *a* rath Y (where Y snicker-snacked X). It does not imply the existence of a single rath that is snicker-snacked by all other raths.\n    *   Consider the R1-R2 example: R1 snicker-snacked R2, R2 snicker-snacked R1.\n        *   Is there a rath that every rath snicker-snacked?\n        *   If RathZ = R1: Did R1 snicker-snack R1? Not necessarily. Did R2 snicker-snack R1? Yes. So R1 is not necessarily snicker-snacked by *every* rath.\n        *   If RathZ = R2: Did R1 snicker-snack R2? Yes. Did R2 snicker-snack R2? Not necessarily. So R2 is not necessarily snicker-snacked by *every* rath.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given \"Rath Snicker-Snack Rule\" and the existence of at least one rath is statement 1.\n\nThe other information (Zindle, Rafin/Bungo, Tove/Beamish) is distractors for this specific question about raths and snicker-snacking relationships among them.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

Rafin galumphed over Bungo. (`G(Rafin, Bungo)`) - This contradicts D3. So, statement 1 must be false.\n*   6. Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo. (`\u00acG(Rafin, Bungo)`) - This is exactly D3. So, statement 6 must be true.\n\nLet's check if we can deduce anything else.\n\nFrom \"Rafin will whiffle unless every tove galumphed over Rafin\":\n`W(Rafin) \u2228 \u2200x (T(x) \u2192 G(x, Rafin))`\n\nFrom \"If not all toves will whiffle, then Rafin won't whiffle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n`\u2203x (T(x) \u2227 \u00acW(x)) \u2192 (\u00acW(Rafin) \u2192 \u2203x (T(x) \u2227 \u00acG(x, Bungo)))`\n\nWe know `\u00acG(Rafin, Bungo)` (D3). This means `\u2203x (T(x) \u2227 \u00acG(x, Bungo))` is true because Rafin is a tove (`T(Rafin)`) and Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo (`\u00acG(Rafin, Bungo)`).\nSo, the consequent of the implication `(\u00acW(Rafin) \u2192 \u2203x (T(x) \u2227 \u00acG(x, Bungo)))` becomes `(\u00acW(Rafin) \u2192 True)`.\nThis entire consequent `(\u00acW(Rafin) \u2192 True)` is always true, regardless of `W(Rafin)`.\nTherefore, the entire conditional statement \"If not all toves will whiffle, then Rafin won't whiffle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" is true if its consequent is true. Since the consequent is `(\u00acW(Rafin) \u2192 True)`, which is always true, the entire statement is true. This doesn't help us deduce `W(Rafin)`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on what we've found:\n\n1.  Rafin galumphed over Bungo. (False, contradicts D3)\n2.  Bungo didn't galumph over Rafin. (We don't have information about Bungo galumphing over Rafin)\n3.  Zindle and Rafin will whiffle. (We know `G(Rafin, Zindle)`, but nothing about Zindle whiffing or Rafin whiffing for certain)\n4.  Zindle will whiffle. (No information about Zindle whiffing)\n5.  Bungo galumphed over Rafin. (We don't have information about Bungo galumphing over Rafin)\n6.  Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo. (True, this is D3)\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on our deductions is statement 6.\n\nLet's double check the reasoning.\n1.  \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" -> `\u2200x (T(x) \u2192 \u00acG(x, Bungo))`\n2.  \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove\" -> `T(Rafin)`\nFrom (1) and (2), substitute Rafin for x in (1): `T(Rafin) \u2192 \u00acG(Rafin, Bungo)`. Since `T(Rafin)` is true, `\u00acG(Rafin, Bungo)` must be true.\nThis means \"Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo\" is true.\n\nTherefore, option 6 is true.\nOption 1 is the negation of option 6, so it must be false.\n\nThe other statements cannot be definitively proven true or false from the given information. For example, we know `G(Rafin, Zindle)`, but this doesn't tell us anything about Zindle whiffing. We also don't have any information about Bungo galumphing over Rafin.\n\nFinal Answer: The statement that must be true is \"Rafin didn't galumph over Bungo.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze the statements.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a tove (T), a borogove (B), or a rath (R).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Rath-Tove Snicker-Snack:** Every rath snicker-snacked a tove.\n    *   Symbolically: $\\forall x (R(x) \\implies \\exists y (T(y) \\land SnickerSnacked(x, y)))$\n4.  **Borogove Chortle Chain:** A borogove chortled at a borogove that chortled at a rath.\n    *   Symbolically: $\\exists b_1 (B(b_1) \\land \\exists b_2 (B(b_2) \\land ChortledAt(b_1, b_2) \\land \\exists r (R(r) \\land ChortledAt(b_2, r))))$\n    *   This statement primarily confirms the existence of borogoves and raths, and a specific chortling relationship. It doesn't seem to directly impact the \"snicker-snack\" relationships or the core logical structure of the problem.\n5.  **Conditional Statement (Bungo/Rafin):** If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath chortled at Rafin.\n    *   Let $P$ be \"Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\" ($\\forall x (R(x) \\implies SnickerSnacked(x, Bungo)))$\n    *   Let $Q$ be \"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\" ($\\neg SnickerSnacked(Bungo, Bungo)$)\n    *   Let $S$ be \"Every rath chortled at Rafin.\" ($\\forall x (R(x) \\implies ChortledAt(x, Rafin)))$\n    *   The statement is: $P \\implies (Q \\implies S)$\n\n**Analysis of the Conditional Statement (Point 5):**\n\nThe conditional statement $P \\implies (Q \\implies S)$ is a complex one. Let's consider its implications.\nThis statement is a material implication. It means that if $P$ is true, then $(Q \\implies S)$ must be true. If $P$ is false, then the entire statement is true regardless of $Q$ and $S$.\n\nThe problem asks what *must* be true. This means we need to find statements that are necessarily true given all the premises.\n\nLet's re-examine the core premise about snicker-snacking:\n**\"Every rath snicker-snacked a tove.\"**\nThis is a crucial piece of information. Let's call this premise (P3).\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n1.  **A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    *   This means $\\exists t (T(t) \\land \\exists r (R(r) \\land SnickerSnacked(t, r)))$.\n    *   Does (P3) \"Every rath snicker-snacked a tove\" imply this? No. (P3) is about raths being the subject of the snicker-snacking action, not the object. We know a rath snicker-snacked *some* tove, but we don't know if any tove snicker-snacked any rath. This is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This means $\\forall t (T(t) \\implies \\forall r (R(r) \\implies SnickerSnacked(t, r)))$.\n    *   This is a very strong statement. (P3) only tells us about raths snicker-snacking toves. This is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    *   This means $\\forall t (T(t) \\implies \\exists r (R(r) \\land SnickerSnacked(t, r)))$.\n    *   Similar to statement 1, this is about toves being the subject. (P3) does not imply this. This is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **A tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This means $\\exists t (T(t) \\land \\forall r (R(r) \\implies SnickerSnacked(t, r)))$.\n    *   Again, this is about a tove being the subject. (P3) does not imply this. This is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This means $\\neg (\\exists t (T(t) \\land \\forall r (R(r) \\implies SnickerSnacked(t, r))))$.\n    *   This is the negation of statement 4. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny statement 4, so we can't confirm this negation either. This is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **A rath snicker-snacked a tove.**\n    *   This means $\\exists r (R(r) \\land \\exists t (T(t) \\land SnickerSnacked(r, t)))$.\n    *   Let's look at (P3): \"Every rath snicker-snacked a tove.\"\n        *   $\\forall x (R(x) \\implies \\exists y (T(y) \\land SnickerSnacked(x, y)))$\n    *   We are also told that \"there's at least one of each\" (tove, borogove, rath). So, we know there exists at least one rath. Let's call this rath $r_0$.\n    *   From (P3), since $R(r_0)$ is true, it must be true that $\\exists y (T(y) \\land SnickerSnacked(r_0, y))$.\n    *   This directly implies that there exists a rath ($r_0$) and there exists a tove ($y$) such that the rath snicker-snacked the tove.\n    *   Therefore, \"A rath snicker-snacked a tove\" must be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given premises, particularly \"Every rath snicker-snacked a tove\" and \"there's at least one of each\" (which guarantees the existence of at least one rath), is statement 6. The complex conditional about Bungo and Rafin does not seem to affect the truth of the snicker-snacking relationships between the general categories of toves, borogoves, and raths.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

(This means Bungo *is* mimsy).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom statement 5, we know:\n*   **Bungo is mimsy.**\n\nFrom statement 4, we know:\n*   **Only borogoves are beamish.** This is a crucial piece of information. It means:\n    *   If something is beamish, it *must* be a borogove.\n    *   Toves are not beamish.\n    *   Raths are not beamish.\n\nNow let's combine statement 2 with statement 4:\n*   Statement 2: Bungo or Rafin are beamish.\n*   Statement 4: Only borogoves are beamish.\n\nIf Bungo is beamish, then by statement 4, Bungo must be a borogove.\nIf Rafin is beamish, then by statement 4, Rafin must be a borogove.\n\nSince at least one of them (Bungo or Rafin) is beamish, and anything beamish must be a borogove, it logically follows that **at least one borogove is beamish.**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the statements based on this conclusion:\n\n*   **1. A borogove is beamish.**\n    *   As derived above, since Bungo or Rafin is beamish, and only borogoves can be beamish, there must be at least one borogove that is beamish. **This statement must be true.**\n\n*   **2. No borogoves are beamish.**\n    *   This contradicts our finding that at least one borogove is beamish. **This statement must be false.**\n\n*   **3. Not all borogoves are beamish.**\n    *   We know *a* borogove is beamish, but we don't have enough information to determine if *all* borogoves are beamish or not. It's possible some borogoves are beamish and some are not, or it's possible all borogoves are beamish. We cannot definitively say \"not all borogoves are beamish.\" **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **4. Every borogove is beamish.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, we don't have enough information to conclude this. We only know *at least one* borogove is beamish. **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **5. Only borogoves are beamish and not all borogoves are beamish.**\n    *   The first part (\"Only borogoves are beamish\") is given as true (statement 4). However, the second part (\"not all borogoves are beamish\") is not necessarily true, as explained for statement 3. Therefore, the conjunction of these two is not necessarily true. **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **6. Zindle is mimsy.**\n    *   Let's look at statement 3: \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   We know Bungo is mimsy. This doesn't tell us anything about Zindle being mimsy. The condition \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" is not something we can confirm or deny. Even if it were true, the consequence is about Bungo galumphing and borogoves chortling, not about Zindle's mimsiness. There's no information linking Zindle's mimsiness to any of the given facts. **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

(B chortled at Zindle = False)\n*   **Fact 2:** A borogove is uffish (B_Uffish) just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle (not All_T_Snicker_Z).\n    *   This can be written as: B_Uffish <=> not All_T_Snicker_Z\n*   **Fact 3:** A borogove chortled at Zindle (B_Chortled_Z) just in case Bungo isn't beamish (not Bungo_Beamish).\n    *   This can be written as: B_Chortled_Z <=> not Bungo_Beamish\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom Fact 1, we know:\n*   **B_Chortled_Z is False.**\n\nNow, let's use this in Fact 3:\n*   B_Chortled_Z <=> not Bungo_Beamish\n*   False <=> not Bungo_Beamish\n\nFor this equivalence to hold, \"not Bungo_Beamish\" must also be False.\n*   Therefore, not Bungo_Beamish is False.\n*   This means **Bungo_Beamish is True.**\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1.  **Bungo is uffish.**\n    *   We have no information linking Bungo's uffishness to anything directly. Bungo could be a tove, borogove, or rath. If Bungo is a borogove, then his uffishness depends on \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\". If Bungo is a tove or rath, the definition of uffishness for borogoves doesn't apply to him. We cannot determine this.\n\n2.  **Zindle is uffish.**\n    *   We have no information about Zindle's category (tove, borogove, rath) or any definition of uffishness for Zindle. We cannot determine this.\n\n3.  **Bungo isn't beamish.**\n    *   From our derivation, we found that Bungo_Beamish is True. Therefore, \"Bungo isn't beamish\" is False.\n\n4.  **Zindle and Bungo are uffish.**\n    *   Since we cannot determine if Bungo is uffish or Zindle is uffish, we cannot determine if both are uffish.\n\n5.  **Bungo is beamish.**\n    *   From our derivation, we concluded that **Bungo is beamish must be True.**\n\n6.  **Zindle isn't uffish.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about Zindle's uffishness. We cannot determine this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the logical deductions from the given facts, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) exclusively. This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets that cover all entities.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R). So, |T| >= 1, |B| >= 1, |R| >= 1.\n3.  **Rath-Borogove Chortling:** Every rath (r) chortled at a borogove (b) that chortled at it (r).\n    *   For every r in R, there exists a b in B such that:\n        *   r chortled at b (r -> b)\n        *   AND b chortled at r (b -> r)\n4.  **Zindle and Bungo:** Zindle gyred unless every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n    *   This means: (Zindle did not gyre) IMPLIES (Every borogove chortled at Bungo).\n    *   Equivalently: (NOT (Every borogove chortled at Bungo)) IMPLIES (Zindle gyred).\n5.  **Rath and Rafin:** A rath is beamish and Rafin isn't uffish. (This information seems irrelevant to the chortling relationships between borogoves and raths, or Zindle/Bungo).\n\n**Analyzing the Core Relationship (Rath-Borogove Chortling):**\n\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"Every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it.\"\n\nLet's represent this formally:\nFor every r $\\in$ R, there exists a b $\\in$ B such that (r chortled at b) AND (b chortled at r).\n\nThis implies a reciprocal chortling relationship. For every rath, there's at least one borogove with whom it has this mutual chortling.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's go through each statement and see if it *must* be true based on the given information.\n\n**1. A borogove chortled at every rath.**\n    *   This means: There exists a b $\\in$ B such that for every r $\\in$ R, b chortled at r.\n    *   Does the given information guarantee this? No. The given information says *for every rath*, there's *some* borogove it chortled at (and vice-versa). It doesn't say there's *one specific borogove* that chortled at *all* raths.\n    *   *Counterexample:* Let R = {r1, r2} and B = {b1, b2}.\n        *   r1 chortled at b1, and b1 chortled at r1.\n        *   r2 chortled at b2, and b2 chortled at r2.\n        *   In this scenario, \"A borogove chortled at every rath\" is false, because b1 didn't chortle at r2, and b2 didn't chortle at r1. But the original condition (\"Every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it\") is satisfied.\n    *   **False.**\n\n**2. No borogoves chortled at every rath.**\n    *   This means: For every b $\\in$ B, it is NOT the case that (b chortled at every rath).\n    *   Equivalently: For every b $\\in$ B, there exists an r $\\in$ R such that b did NOT chortle at r.\n    *   Does the given information guarantee this? No. It's possible that there's only one borogove (b1) and one rath (r1). Then r1 chortled at b1 and b1 chortled at r1. In this case, b1 *did* chortle at every rath (since r1 is the only rath). So, this statement would be false in that scenario.\n    *   *Counterexample:* R = {r1}, B = {b1}. r1 chortled at b1, b1 chortled at r1. Here, b1 chortled at every rath (r1). So, \"No borogoves chortled at every rath\" is false.\n    *   **False.**\n\n**3. Every borogove chortled at every rath.**\n    *   This means: For every b $\\in$ B, and for every r $\\in$ R, b chortled at r.\n    *   Does the given information guarantee this? No. The original statement is much weaker. It only guarantees a *mutual* chortling for *each* rath with *some* borogove. It doesn't imply that *all* borogoves chortle at *all* raths.\n    *   *Counterexample:* Same as for statement 1. R = {r1, r2}, B = {b1, b2}.\n        *   r1 chortled at b1, b1 chortled at r1.\n        *   r2 chortled at b2, b2 chortled at r2.\n        *   Here, b1 did not chortle at r2, and b2 did not chortle at r1. So, \"Every borogove chortled at every rath\" is false.\n    *   **False.**\n\n**4. Every borogove chortled at a rath.**\n    *   This means: For every b $\\in$ B, there exists an r $\\in$ R such that b chortled at r.\n    *   Does the given information guarantee this? Yes.\n        *   We know: For every r $\\in$ R, there exists a b $\\in$ B such that (r chortled at b) AND (b chortled at r).\n        *   Let's consider an arbitrary borogove, say b_x. Does b_x *have* to chortle at *some* rath?\n        *   The original statement guarantees that *every rath* has a borogove it chortles with (and vice-versa). It doesn't directly state that *every borogove* has a rath it chortles with.\n        *   Consider a scenario where there's a borogove, say b_extra, that no rath chortles at.\n        *   If no rath chortles at b_extra, then the condition \"Every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it\" would still hold for all raths, as long as they find *some other* borogove to chortle with.\n        *   However, the phrasing \"Every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it\" implies a *reciprocal* relationship. If r chortled at b, and b chortled at r, then b *did* chortle at a rath (namely, r).\n        *   The question is, can there be a borogove that is *not* part of any such reciprocal pair?\n        *   Let's assume there is a borogove, b_0, such that b_0 chortled at no rath.\n        *   If b_0 chortled at no rath, then it cannot be the 'b' in any (r -> b AND b -> r) pair.\n        *   This doesn't contradict the original statement. The original statement only guarantees that for *every rath*, there's *some* borogove it has a mutual chortling relationship with. It doesn't say that *every borogove* must be involved in such a relationship.\n        *   *Counterexample:* R = {r1}, B = {b1, b2}.\n            *   r1 chortled at b1, b1 chortled at r1. (This satisfies the condition for r1).\n            *   b2 chortled at no rath.\n            *   In this case, \"Every borogove chortled at a rath\" is false because b2 did not chortle at a rath. But the original condition is satisfied.\n    *   **False.**\n\n**5. A borogove chortled at a rath.**\n    *   This means: There exists a b $\\in$ B and there exists an r $\\in$ R such that b chortled at r.\n    *   Does the given information guarantee this? Yes.\n        *   We know there's at least one rath (let's call it r1).\n        *   From the condition \"Every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it\", we know that for r1, there exists some borogove (let's call it b1) such that r1 chortled at b1 AND b1 chortled at r1.\n        *   Since b1 chortled at r1, this statement (\"A borogove chortled at a rath\") is true.\n    *   **True.**\n\n**6. No borogoves chortled at a rath.**\n    *   This means: For every b $\\in$ B, and for every r $\\in$ R, b did NOT chortle at r.\n    *   This is the direct opposite of statement 5. Since statement 5 is true, this statement must be false.\n    *   **False.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is statement 5. The core premise \"Every rath chortled at a borogove that chortled at it\" implies the existence of at least one such reciprocal pair. Since there's at least one rath and at least one borogove, and every rath is involved in such a pair, it means there must be at least one instance where a borogove chortled at a rath.\n\nFor example, let r_0 be any rath (we know at least one exists). By the rule, there exists a borogove b_0 such that r_0 chortled at b_0 AND b_0 chortled at r_0. The second part of this conjunction (b_0 chortled at r_0) directly satisfies statement 5.\n\nThe information about Zindle, Bungo, beamish raths, and uffish Rafin is extraneous to the chortling relationships between borogoves and raths.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

It does *not* imply that all borogoves are beamish.\n\n3.  **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin.**\n    *   This means there is at least one rath that did *not* galumph over Rafin.\n\n4.  **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n    *   \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" is a statement about Bungo's action, not directly about its type or beamishness. It's likely a distractor for this problem.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove\" means \"Rafin *is* a tove.\"\n        *   Therefore, **Rafin is a tove.**\n\n5.  **Zindle isn't a borogove unless no borogoves are beamish.**\n    *   This is a conditional statement: \"If borogoves are beamish (i.e., at least one borogove is beamish), then Zindle isn't a borogove.\"\n    *   Let's rephrase: \"Zindle is a borogove ONLY IF no borogoves are beamish.\"\n    *   Or, equivalently, \"If at least one borogove is beamish, then Zindle is not a borogove.\"\n\n**Deductions from the Given Information:**\n\n*   From (2): \"Only borogoves are beamish.\" This means if something is beamish, it's a borogove.\n*   From (1) and (2): Since there's at least one borogove, and borogoves *can* be beamish (the rule doesn't say they *can't* be), it's possible that *some* borogoves are beamish.\n*   From (4): **Rafin is a tove.**\n    *   Since Rafin is a tove, and \"only borogoves are beamish\" (from 2), Rafin cannot be beamish.\n    *   Therefore, **Rafin is not beamish.**\n\n*   Let's re-evaluate (5): \"Zindle isn't a borogove unless no borogoves are beamish.\"\n    *   Consider the possibility that *some* borogoves *are* beamish.\n        *   If at least one borogove is beamish, then according to (5), Zindle isn't a borogove.\n        *   If Zindle isn't a borogove, then Zindle must be either a tove or a rath (from 1).\n        *   If Zindle is a tove or a rath, then according to (2) (\"Only borogoves are beamish\"), Zindle cannot be beamish. So, if at least one borogove is beamish, Zindle is not beamish.\n    *   Consider the possibility that *no* borogoves are beamish.\n        *   If no borogoves are beamish, then the condition \"no borogoves are beamish\" is true. In this case, (5) tells us nothing about whether Zindle is a borogove or not. Zindle *could* be a borogove, or a tove, or a rath.\n        *   However, if *no* borogoves are beamish, then *nothing* is beamish (because only borogoves *can* be beamish). In this scenario, Zindle would not be beamish.\n\n    *   Let's combine this.\n        *   Case 1: There exists at least one beamish borogove.\n            *   From (5), Zindle is not a borogove.\n            *   From (2), since Zindle is not a borogove, Zindle is not beamish.\n        *   Case 2: There are no beamish borogoves (i.e., no borogoves are beamish).\n            *   From (2), if no borogoves are beamish, then nothing is beamish.\n            *   Therefore, Zindle is not beamish.\n\n    *   In both possible cases (whether or not any borogoves are beamish), **Zindle is not beamish.**\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n1.  **Rafin is beamish.**\n    *   We deduced that Rafin is a tove.\n    *   Since \"only borogoves are beamish,\" a tove cannot be beamish.\n    *   Therefore, Rafin is *not* beamish.\n    *   **Statement 1 is FALSE.**\n\n2.  **Zindle and Bungo are beamish.**\n    *   We deduced that Zindle is not beamish.\n    *   Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n    *   **Statement 2 is FALSE.**\n\n3.  **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n    *   We deduced that Zindle is not beamish.\n    *   We deduced that Rafin is not beamish.\n    *   Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n    *   **Statement 3 is FALSE.**\n\n4.  **Zindle isn't beamish.**\n    *   We deduced that Zindle is not beamish (from the analysis of point 5).\n    *   **Statement 4 is TRUE.**\n\n5.  **Zindle is beamish.**\n    *   This is the opposite of Statement 4.\n    *   Since Statement 4 is true, this statement must be false.\n    *   **Statement 5 is FALSE.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the logical deductions, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(Rafin != T)\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\n**Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (related to Raths and Bungo):**\n\n*   **Given (3):** \"No raths galumphed over Bungo.\" This is a direct and strong statement.\n\n    *   **Statement 1: Every rath galumphed over Bungo.** This directly contradicts \"No raths galumphed over Bungo.\" So, **False**.\n    *   **Statement 2: A rath galumphed over Bungo.** This also contradicts \"No raths galumphed over Bungo.\" So, **False**.\n    *   **Statement 3: Not all raths galumphed over Bungo.** If \"No raths galumphed over Bungo\" is true, then it's certainly true that \"not all raths galumphed over Bungo\" (in fact, *zero* raths galumphed over Bungo). This statement is consistent with and implied by the given information. So, **True**.\n    *   **Statement 4: Bungo galumphed over a rath.** The given information only tells us about raths galumphing over Bungo, not the other way around. We have no information to confirm or deny this. So, **Cannot be determined**.\n    *   **Statement 5: Bungo galumphed over every rath.** Similar to statement 4, we have no information about Bungo galumphing over raths. So, **Cannot be determined**.\n\n**Statement 6: Rafin is uffish.**\n\n*   **Given (6):** Rafin isn't a tove.\n*   **Given (1):** Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n*   Since Rafin isn't a tove, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n*   **Given (5):** Every borogove is uffish.\n*   If Rafin is a borogove, then Rafin is uffish.\n*   However, if Rafin is a rath, we have no information about raths being uffish. Raths are not necessarily uffish.\n*   Since Rafin *could* be a rath, and raths are not necessarily uffish, we cannot definitively conclude that Rafin is uffish. So, **Cannot be determined**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only one statement must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

(This means at least one tove did *not* gimble, or some toves gimbled and some didn't).\n4.  **Toves & Galumphing (Bungo):** No toves galumphed over Bungo. (This is a crucial one: Toves -> Not (Galumphed over Bungo)).\n5.  **Rafin:** Rafin isn't a tove. (Rafin is either a borogove or a rath).\n6.  **Rath & Galumphing (Bungo) / Toves & Whiffling:** A rath galumphed over Bungo **unless** not all toves will whiffle.\n\nLet's rephrase the last point (6) using logical notation:\nLet G_R_B be \"A rath galumphed over Bungo.\"\nLet NW_T be \"Not all toves will whiffle.\"\n\nThe statement \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless not all toves will whiffle\" means:\nIf NW_T is false, then G_R_B is true.\nIf NW_T is true, then G_R_B *might* be true or false (the \"unless\" clause only specifies what happens if the condition is *not* met).\n\nThis is equivalent to: G_R_B OR NW_T.\nOr, more precisely, it's often interpreted as: (NOT NW_T) IMPLIES G_R_B.\nWhich is equivalent to: G_R_B OR NW_T.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n**Statement 1: Bungo galumphed over a tove.**\nFrom point 4: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This means no tove performed the action of \"galumphing over Bungo.\"\nThis statement says \"Bungo galumphed over a tove.\" This implies that a tove was the *object* of Bungo's galumphing.\nThe given information (4) is about toves *performing* the action. It says \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This means for any Tove X, X did not galumph over Bungo.\nThis statement (1) is about Bungo galumphing over a Tove. This is a different relationship.\nHowever, the phrasing \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" is ambiguous. Does it mean \"No Tove X is such that X galumphed over Bungo\" or \"Bungo did not galumph over any Tove\"?\nGiven the typical structure of such problems, \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" most naturally means that no tove performed the action of galumphing over Bungo.\nIf it meant \"Bungo did not galumph over any tove,\" then statement 1 would be false.\nLet's assume \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" means \"For any Tove X, X did not galumph over Bungo.\"\nThis statement (1) is about Bungo's action. We have no information about Bungo's actions towards toves. So, we cannot determine if this is true or false.\n\n**Statement 2: Every tove galumphed over Bungo.**\nFrom point 4: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This directly contradicts \"Every tove galumphed over Bungo.\"\nTherefore, Statement 2 must be false.\n\n**Statement 3: A tove galumphed over Bungo.**\nFrom point 4: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This directly contradicts \"A tove galumphed over Bungo.\"\nTherefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n**Statement 4: Bungo galumphed over every tove.**\nSimilar to Statement 1, this is about Bungo's action towards toves. We have no information about Bungo's actions towards toves. So, we cannot determine if this is true or false.\n\n**Statement 5: Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.**\nFrom point 4: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This means *zero* toves galumphed over Bungo.\nIf zero toves galumphed over Bungo, then it is certainly true that \"Not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" (because \"all toves galumphed over Bungo\" would be false).\nTherefore, Statement 5 must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Rafin will whiffle.**\nFrom point 6: \"A rath galumphed over Bungo unless not all toves will whiffle.\"\nThis means: (A rath galumphed over Bungo) OR (Not all toves will whiffle).\nLet's call \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\" as R_G_B.\nLet's call \"Not all toves will whiffle\" as NW_T.\nSo, R_G_B OR NW_T.\n\nWe know from point 4 that \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This means that the condition \"all toves galumphed over Bungo\" is false.\nThis information doesn't directly help with \"whiffle.\"\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"unless\" clause.\n\"A unless B\" is typically interpreted as \"If not B, then A\".\nSo, \"If (it is NOT the case that 'not all toves will whiffle'), then (a rath galumphed over Bungo).\"\nThis simplifies to: \"If (all toves will whiffle), then (a rath galumphed over Bungo).\"\n\nLet AW_T be \"All toves will whiffle.\"\nLet R_G_B be \"A rath galumphed over Bungo.\"\nSo, AW_T IMPLIES R_G_B.\n\nWe don't know if AW_T is true or false. We don't know if R_G_B is true or false.\nWe know Rafin isn't a tove (point 5). So Rafin is a borogove or a rath.\nIf Rafin is a rath, then \"Rafin will whiffle\" is a statement about a rath.\nBut the condition is about \"toves will whiffle.\"\n\nLet's consider the possibility that \"unless\" means exclusive OR (XOR).\n(A rath galumphed over Bungo) XOR (Not all toves will whiffle).\nThis means exactly one of them is true.\nSo, (R_G_B AND NOT NW_T) OR (NOT R_G_B AND NW_T).\n\nLet's stick to the standard interpretation of \"A unless B\" as \"If not B, then A\".\nSo, (NOT (Not all toves will whiffle)) IMPLIES (A rath galumphed over Bungo).\nThis means: (All toves will whiffle) IMPLIES (A rath galumphed over Bungo).\n\nWe have no information that forces \"Rafin will whiffle\" to be true.\nWe don't know if \"All toves will whiffle\" is true or false.\nWe don't know if \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\" is true or false.\nRafin is not a tove, so information about toves whiffling doesn't directly apply to Rafin.\nWe cannot conclude that Rafin will whiffle.\n\nLet's re-check the interpretation of \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\nIf it means \"No Tove X is such that X galumphed over Bungo,\" then:\n- Statement 1: \"Bungo galumphed over a tove.\" (Unknown)\n- Statement 2: \"Every tove galumphed over Bungo.\" (False)\n- Statement 3: \"A tove galumphed over Bungo.\" (False)\n- Statement 4: \"Bungo galumphed over every tove.\" (Unknown)\n- Statement 5: \"Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" (True, because zero toves galumphed over Bungo).\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is Statement 5.\n\nFinal check on the \"unless\" clause:\n\"A unless B\" is logically equivalent to \"A or B\".\nSo, \"A rath galumphed over Bungo OR not all toves will whiffle.\"\nLet R_G_B = \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\"\nLet NW_T = \"Not all toves will whiffle\"\nSo, R_G_B OR NW_T.\n\nDoes this help with Statement 6: \"Rafin will whiffle\"?\nWe know Rafin is not a tove. So Rafin is a borogove or a rath.\nIf Rafin is a rath, then \"Rafin will whiffle\" is a statement about a rath.\nThe disjunction R_G_B OR NW_T doesn't force \"Rafin will whiffle\" to be true.\nFor example, it could be that R_G_B is true (a rath galumphed over Bungo), and NW_T is false (all toves will whiffle). In this case, Rafin might or might not whiffle.\nOr it could be that R_G_B is false (no rath galumphed over Bungo), and NW_T is true (not all toves will whiffle). In this case, Rafin might or might not whiffle.\nWe cannot deduce anything about Rafin whiffling.\n\nTherefore, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This doesn't tell us about *all* toves. There could be other toves that are not mimsy. We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n\n2.  **No toves are mimsy.**\n    *   This is directly contradicted by the fact that Rafin is a tove and is mimsy. So, this statement is false.\n\n3.  **Zindle will whiffle.**\n    *   We know Zindle is mimsy. We know \"No borogoves will whiffle.\" We don't know if Zindle is a borogove, a tove, or a rath. We also don't have any information linking mimsiness to whiffling, or Zindle's type to whiffling. Therefore, we cannot determine if Zindle will whiffle.\n\n4.  **Not all toves are mimsy.**\n    *   We know Rafin is a tove and is mimsy. This statement claims that there is at least one tove that is *not* mimsy. We don't have any information to confirm or deny this. It's possible all toves are mimsy, or it's possible some are not. We cannot definitively say this is true.\n\n5.  **A tove is mimsy.**\n    *   We know Rafin is a tove and Rafin is mimsy. Therefore, there exists at least one tove that is mimsy (Rafin). This statement must be true.\n\n6.  **Only toves are mimsy.**\n    *   This means if something is mimsy, it *must* be a tove. We know Zindle is mimsy. Is Zindle a tove? We don't know. Zindle could be a borogove or a rath and still be mimsy, which would make this statement false. We only know Rafin is a tove and mimsy. We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This means (Ra is M) OR (Z is M).\n*   **Chortling Rule 1:** Every T chortled at every B. (For all t in T, for all b in B, t chortled at b).\n*   **Chortling Rule 2:** A B chortled at a B that chortled at an R. (There exists b1 in B such that there exists b2 in B such that b1 chortled at b2 AND b2 chortled at r for some r in R).\n\n**Analyzing Each Statement:**\n\n**1.

We have no information about borogoves chortling at toves.\n    *   **Cannot be determined / Not necessarily true.**\n\n**6.

(This means there is at least one rath that did NOT galumph over Rafin).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's use the notation:\n*   `T(x)`: x is a tove\n*   `B(x)`: x is a borogove\n*   `R(x)`: x is a rath\n*   `G(x, y)`: x galumphed over y\n\nFrom point 5: `For all x, if T(x), then NOT G(x, Bungo)`.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. Bungo galumphed over a tove.**\n    *   This statement is `Exists x such that T(x) AND G(Bungo, x)`.\n    *   We have no information about what Bungo galumphed over. We only know what *didn't* galumph over Bungo (toves). This statement *could* be true, or it *could* be false. It's not necessarily true.\n\n**2. Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   This statement is `NOT (For all x, if T(x), then G(x, Bungo))`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `Exists x such that T(x) AND NOT G(x, Bungo)`.\n    *   From point 5, we know `For all x, if T(x), then NOT G(x, Bungo)`.\n    *   Since there is at least one tove (from point 2), let's call it `t1`.\n    *   According to point 5, `NOT G(t1, Bungo)`.\n    *   Therefore, there exists at least one tove (t1) that did not galumph over Bungo.\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n**3. Every tove galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   This statement is `For all x, if T(x), then G(x, Bungo)`.\n    *   This directly contradicts point 5, which states `For all x, if T(x), then NOT G(x, Bungo)`.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**4. A tove galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   This statement is `Exists x such that T(x) AND G(x, Bungo)`.\n    *   This is the negation of point 5.\n    *   Since point 5 (`No toves galumphed over Bungo`) is given as true, its negation (`A tove galumphed over Bungo`) must be false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**5. Bungo galumphed over every tove.**\n    *   This statement is `For all x, if T(x), then G(Bungo, x)`.\n    *   Similar to statement 1, we have no information about what Bungo galumphed over. This statement *could* be true, or it *could* be false. It's not necessarily true.\n\n**6. Zindle is a tove.**\n    *   We know Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin. This tells us nothing about Zindle's category. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 2 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(This is a complex conditional that seems unrelated to the snicker-snack relationships and is likely a distractor for the current problem).\n\n**Focus on Snicker-Snack Relationships:**\n\nThe crucial piece of information for the snicker-snack statements is: \"Every tove snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.\"\n\nLet's denote this as: $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R \\text{ such that } (S(t, r) \\land S(r, t))$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n*   From the rule, \"Every tove snicker-snacked a rath...\". Since there is at least one tove, and every tove snicker-snacked *a* rath, it logically follows that *a* tove (at least one) snicker-snacked *a* rath (at least one).\n*   This statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 2: No toves snicker-snacked a rath.**\n*   This directly contradicts the given rule \"Every tove snicker-snacked a rath...\".\n*   This statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 3: Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   The rule states \"Every tove snicker-snacked *a* rath\" (meaning at least one specific rath), not *every* rath.\n*   Consider a scenario: Toves = {T1}, Raths = {R1, R2}.\n    *   Rule: T1 snicker-snacked R1, and R1 snicker-snacked T1.\n    *   In this scenario, T1 did not snicker-snack R2.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n*   The rule is about toves snicker-snacking raths, and raths snicker-snacking *those specific* toves. It doesn't imply that a single tove is snicker-snacked by *all* raths.\n*   Consider Toves = {T1, T2}, Raths = {R1, R2}.\n    *   Rule: T1 snicker-snacked R1, R1 snicker-snacked T1.\n    *   Rule: T2 snicker-snacked R2, R2 snicker-snacked T2.\n    *   In this case, R2 did not snicker-snack T1, and R1 did not snicker-snack T2. So there isn't a tove that *every* rath snicker-snacked.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   This is the negation of \"A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\"\n*   The rule states \"Every tove snicker-snacked *a* rath\". It does not preclude a tove from snicker-snacking *every* rath.\n*   Consider Toves = {T1}, Raths = {R1, R2}.\n    *   If T1 snicker-snacked R1 (and R1 snicker-snacked T1), AND T1 also snicker-snacked R2 (and R2 snicker-snacked T1). In this case, T1 snicker-snacked *every* rath.\n    *   The rule \"Every tove snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it\" would be satisfied if T1 snicker-snacked R1 (and R1 snicker-snacked T1). It doesn't prevent T1 from also snicker-snacking R2.\n*   So, it's possible for a tove to snicker-snack every rath. Therefore, \"No toves snicker-snacked every rath\" is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: A tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   As discussed in Statement 5, this is not necessarily true. The rule only guarantees that every tove snicker-snacked *at least one* rath (that snicker-snacked it back). It doesn't guarantee that any tove snicker-snacked *all* raths.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This is a stronger statement than \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\". While Fact A means *at least one* tove didn't chortle, \"no toves chortled\" means *all* toves didn't chortle. We don't have enough information to confirm \"no toves chortled at Bungo\". It's possible some toves chortled and some didn't.\n    *   Since we cannot confirm the second part, we cannot confirm the entire conjunction.\n\n3.  **\"Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\"**\n    *   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is Fact A, which is true.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo\" means $\\neg C(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo})$, which contradicts Fact B.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n4.  **\"Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\"**\n    *   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is Fact A, which is true.\n    *   \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" contradicts Fact B.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5.  **\"Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo chortled at Bungo.\"**\n    *   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is Fact A, which is true.\n    *   \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is Fact B, which is true.\n    *   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire statement must be true.\n\n6.  **\"Bungo chortled at Bungo and no toves chortled at Bungo.\"**\n    *   \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is Fact B, which is true.\n    *   \"no toves chortled at Bungo\" means $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$. As discussed in option 2, we don't have enough information to confirm this. Fact A only states that *not all* toves chortled, meaning *at least one* didn't. It doesn't mean *all* didn't.\n    *   Since we cannot confirm the second part, we cannot confirm the entire conjunction.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe crucial pieces of information are:\n*   From \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.\" we get: **Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**\n*   From \"Bungo chortled at Bungo and every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\" we get: **Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n\nStatement 5 combines these two facts directly.\n\nThe information about Zindle, Rafin, and Raths was not needed to determine the truth of statement 5, but it doesn't contradict it either.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

There's at least one of each.\n    *   This means T, B, R are disjoint sets and their union is everything.\n2.  **Rafin:** Rafin is a tove (R_f \u2208 T).\n3.  **Borogoves & Uffish:** Every borogove is uffish (B \u2192 U).\n4.  **Rafin & Snicker-snacked Bungo:** It is *not* the case that Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\n    *   Let S(X, Y) mean \"X snicker-snacked Y\".\n    *   \"Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Bungo\" is \u00acS(R_f, B_g).\n    *   \"It is not the case that Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Bungo\" is \u00ac(\u00acS(R_f, B_g)), which simplifies to S(R_f, B_g).\n    *   So, **Rafin snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n5.  **Bungo & Toves & Zindle:** Bungo isn't a borogove just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n    *   Let B_g be Bungo.\n    *   \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" is B_g \u2209 B.\n    *   \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is \u00ac(\u2200t \u2208 T, S(t, Z)).\n    *   The \"just in case\" means equivalence (iff): (B_g \u2209 B) \u2194 \u00ac(\u2200t \u2208 T, S(t, Z)).\n\n**Deductions:**\n\nFrom (4), we know **Rafin snicker-snacked Bungo (S(R_f, B_g))**.\nSince Rafin is a tove (R_f \u2208 T), this means **a tove (specifically, Rafin) snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n\nNow let's look at statement (5): \"A tove snicker-snacked Bungo.\"\nThis statement is directly supported by our deduction from (2) and (4). Since Rafin is a tove and Rafin snicker-snacked Bungo, it must be true that a tove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\nLet's check the other options to see if they *must* be true.\n\n*   **1. Bungo snicker-snacked every tove.** We have no information about Bungo snicker-snacking *any* tove, let alone *every* tove. This is not necessarily true.\n*   **2. Every tove snicker-snacked Bungo.** We only know Rafin (a specific tove) snicker-snacked Bungo. We don't know about other toves. This is not necessarily true.\n*   **3. No toves snicker-snacked Bungo.** This contradicts our finding that Rafin (a tove) snicker-snacked Bungo. So, this is false.\n*   **4. Not all toves snicker-snacked Bungo.** We know Rafin snicker-snacked Bungo. We don't know about other toves. It's possible *all* toves snicker-snacked Bungo, or it's possible *not all* did. We cannot determine this.\n*   **5. A tove snicker-snacked Bungo.** As deduced above, Rafin is a tove and Rafin snicker-snacked Bungo. Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n*   **6. Bungo snicker-snacked a tove.** We have no information about Bungo snicker-snacking any tove. This is not necessarily true.\n\nThe information about borogoves being uffish and the \"just in case\" statement about Bungo and Zindle is not needed to determine the truth of statement (5). It's extra information that might be relevant for other questions, but not for this specific set of options.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem statement by statement.\n\n**Statement 1: \"Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\"**\nThis sets up the three categories of entities and confirms their existence.\n\n**Statement 2: \"A borogove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over a borogove.\"**\nThis tells us about the \"galumphing\" relationship. It implies the existence of at least one tove and at least one borogove. This statement doesn't seem directly relevant to the core logical puzzle about \"snicker-snacking\" and \"whiffling,\" but it confirms the existence of the creatures.\n\n**Statement 3: \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"**\nLet P be the statement \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\" (This means at least one borogove snicker-snacked Rafin).\nLet Q be the statement \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" (This means there is at least one borogove that did *not* snicker-snack Rafin).\n\nThe statement can be written as: P only if Q.\nIn logical terms, this is P -> Q.\nSo, (A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin) -> (Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin).\n\nLet's analyze this implication:\n*   If P is true (A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin), then Q must be true (Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin).\n    If \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true, and \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is also true, this is consistent. It means at least one did, but not all of them did.\n*   What if P is false? (No borogove snicker-snacked Rafin).\n    If P is false, then the implication P -> Q is true regardless of Q's truth value. So, if no borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, the statement holds.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that \"All borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true.\nIf \"All borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true, then:\n*   P (\"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\") is true.\n*   Q (\"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\") is false.\nIn this scenario, P -> Q becomes True -> False, which is False.\nTherefore, the premise \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" *cannot* be true if \"All borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true.\n\nThis means that \"All borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be false.\nIf \"All borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is false, then its negation must be true.\nThe negation of \"All borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n\nSo, from Statement 3, we can definitively conclude: **\"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be true.**\n\n**Statement 4: \"If Rafin won't whiffle, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\"**\nThis statement introduces \"whiffling\" and \"galumphing over Bungo.\" It's a complex conditional.\nLet R be \"Rafin won't whiffle.\"\nLet S be \"Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\nLet T be \"No raths galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\nThe statement is: R -> (S only if T).\nWhich is: R -> (S -> T).\n\nThis statement provides a conditional relationship. However, we have no information about whether Rafin will whiffle or not, or about toves/raths galumphing over Bungo. Therefore, we cannot deduce anything concrete from this statement alone regarding the truth of R, S, or T. It does not affect our conclusion from Statement 3.\n\n**Conclusion from Statement 3:**\nWe established that \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be true.\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n\n1.  **Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove.** (This is about Rafin doing the snicker-snacking, not a borogove doing it. The problem states \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\") This is not directly addressed and is likely a distractor based on the wording.\n2.  **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.** This is exactly what we deduced must be true from Statement 3.\n3.  **A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.** (This is P in our notation). We know that if P is true, then Q must be true. If P is false, then the implication P -> Q is still true. So, P *could* be false (meaning no borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin). We cannot definitively say P must be true. For example, if no borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" is false, and \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true. The original statement \"False only if True\" is true. So, \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" is not necessarily true.\n4.  **Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.** This is the same as \"All borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" We proved this must be false. So, this statement must be false, not true.\n5.  **No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.** This is the negation of \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\" As explained in point 3, this *could* be true, but it's not *necessarily* true. If this were true, then \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" would also be true, and the original premise would hold. However, it's also possible that *some* borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, but not all.\n6.  **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.** Similar to option 1, this is about Rafin doing the snicker-snacking, not a borogove doing it. Not addressed.\n\nTherefore, only statement 2 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

It doesn't mean *all* raths are beamish, just that at least one is.\n\nFrom (3), \"Every rath chortled at Bungo.\" This is a universal statement about raths.\n\nFrom (6), \"It is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" This is a specific statement about Bungo.\n\nLet's consider Bungo's category. Bungo must be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n\n**Case 1: Bungo is a rath.**\nIf Bungo is a rath, then according to (3), \"Every rath chortled at Bungo.\" Since Bungo is a rath, Bungo must have chortled at Bungo.\nHowever, (6) states \"It is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\"\nThis creates a contradiction. Therefore, Bungo cannot be a rath.\n\n**Conclusion from Case 1:** Bungo isn't a rath.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n\n*   **1.

Rafin is beamish.** We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n*   **6. Bungo isn't a rath.** This *must* be true, as proven above.\n\nThe information about borogoves snicker-snacking Rafin and raths chortling at Rafin (statement 4) and the fact that a rath is beamish (statement 5) are not directly used to determine Bungo's category or beamishness, or Rafin's beamishness.

All borogoves are mimsy.\n    *   From P3, we know \"No borogoves are mimsy.\" This means the second part of the implication (\"All borogoves are mimsy\") is false.\n    *   Since the second part is false, the entire statement \"Only borogoves are mimsy\" **must be false**. (Also, P4 tells us \"Not all raths are mimsy,\" which means some raths are *not* mimsy, but it doesn't tell us if *any* raths *are* mimsy. Even if no raths are mimsy, and no toves are mimsy, the statement \"All borogoves are mimsy\" is still false, making the whole statement false).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 1 must be true. The information about P5 (\"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\") is a conditional statement where the antecedent (\"No borogoves are mimsy\") is true (from P3). This means the consequent (\"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\") must also be true. However, this information is not needed to determine the truth value of any of the given statements. The crucial premise is P3: \"No borogoves are mimsy.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Mimsy:** Zindle (Z) and Bungo (U) are mimsy (M). So, Z is M and U is M.\n*   **Chortling:** A borogove chortled at a rath that chortled at a tove. This implies relationships but doesn't directly tell us about properties like \"whiffle\" or \"mimsy\" for specific individuals unless they are identified as the chortlers/chortled.\n*   **Whiffling (Toves):** Not all toves will whiffle (W). This means there exists at least one tove that will not whiffle.\n*   **Rafin:** It is not the case that Rafin (F) is a tove. This means Rafin is either a borogove or a rath.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nWe need to determine which statement *must* be true.\n\n**Key Unknowns:**\n\n*   We don't know if mimsy things whiffle.\n*   We don't know if non-toves whiffle.\n*   We don't know if Zindle or Bungo are toves, borogoves, or raths.\n*   We don't know if Rafin whiffling.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n1.  **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n    *   We know Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.\n    *   We have no information linking \"mimsy\" to \"whiffle.\" They might whiffle, or they might not.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n2.  **Zindle will whiffle.**\n    *   Similar to statement 1, we don't know if mimsy things whiffle.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n3.  **Zindle won't whiffle.**\n    *   Again, we have no information linking \"mimsy\" to \"not whiffle.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n4.  **Not all toves will whiffle and Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n    *   We are given: \"Not all toves will whiffle.\" This part is true.\n    *   We are given: \"Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.\" This means \"Zindle isn't mimsy\" is false.\n    *   Since the second part of the \"and\" statement is false, the entire statement is false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n5.  **Not all toves will whiffle but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n    *   \"Not all toves will whiffle\" is given as true.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy\" means \"Zindle is mimsy.\"\n    *   We are given: \"Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.\" So, \"Zindle is mimsy\" is true.\n    *   Since both parts of the \"but\" (which functions as \"and\" in logical terms here) are true, the entire statement is true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\n6.  **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n    *   We don't know if Zindle will whiffle (as established in 1, 2, 3).\n    *   We don't know if Rafin will whiffle.

We have no information about borogoves or raths whiffling.\n    *   Since we don't know if either will whiffle, we cannot conclude that both *must* whiffle.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

There is at least one T, at least one B, and at least one R.\n2.  **Rath Gimbled:** $\\exists r \\in R$ such that $r$ gimbled. (This fact seems to be a distractor for the given statements, as none of them relate to \"gimbling\").\n3.  **No Raths Chortled at a Rath:** $\\forall r_1 \\in R, \\forall r_2 \\in R$, it is NOT the case that $r_1$ chortled at $r_2$.\n    *   This can be written as: $\\neg (\\exists r_1 \\in R, \\exists r_2 \\in R \\text{ such that } r_1 \\text{ chortled at } r_2)$.\n    *   Or, more strongly: $\\forall r_1 \\in R, \\forall r_2 \\in R, r_1 \\text{ did not chortle at } r_2$.\n4.  **Borogove Snicker-snacked Rule:** $\\forall b_1 \\in B, \\forall b_2 \\in B$, if $b_1$ snicker-snacked $b_2$, then $b_2$ snicker-snacked $b_1$. (This means the \"snicker-snacked\" relationship is symmetric within the set of borogoves).\n5.  **Borogove Chortled Rule:** $\\forall b \\in B, \\forall r \\in R, \\forall t \\in T$, if $r$ chortled at $t$, then $b$ chortled at $r$.\n6.  **Tove Snicker-snacked Zindle Rule:** (No toves snicker-snacked Zindle) $\\iff$ (a borogove chortled at Bungo).\n    *   Let $P$ be \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\".\n    *   Let $Q$ be \"A borogove chortled at Bungo\".\n    *   Then $P \\iff Q$.

This fact also seems to be a distractor for the given statements, as none of them relate to \"Zindle\" or \"Bungo\".\n\n**Crucial Fact for the Statements:**\n\nFact 3: **No Raths Chortled at a Rath.**\nThis means that for any two raths, say $r_x$ and $r_y$ (they can be the same rath), $r_x$ did not chortle at $r_y$.\n\nLet's re-state Fact 3 very clearly:\n$\\forall x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, \\text{it is FALSE that } x \\text{ chortled at } y$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. A rath chortled at every rath.**\n   *   This means: $\\exists r_1 \\in R \\text{ such that } \\forall r_2 \\in R, r_1 \\text{ chortled at } r_2$.\n   *   According to Fact 3, no rath chortled at any rath. Therefore, it's impossible for there to exist a rath that chortled at *every* rath.\n   *   This statement must be **False**.\n\n**2. A rath chortled at a rath.**\n   *   This means: $\\exists r_1 \\in R, \\exists r_2 \\in R \\text{ such that } r_1 \\text{ chortled at } r_2$.\n   *   According to Fact 3, it is explicitly stated that \"No raths chortled at a rath\". This is the direct negation of statement 2.\n   *   This statement must be **False**.\n\n**3. A rath chortled at every rath that chortled at it.**\n   *   This means: $\\exists r_1 \\in R \\text{ such that } \\forall r_2 \\in R, (\\text{if } r_2 \\text{ chortled at } r_1 \\text{ then } r_1 \\text{ chortled at } r_2)$.\n   *   Let's analyze the premise: \"if $r_2$ chortled at $r_1$\".\n   *   From Fact 3, we know that for any $r_2, r_1 \\in R$, it is **false** that $r_2$ chortled at $r_1$.\n   *   Therefore, the premise \" $r_2$ chortled at $r_1$\" is always false.\n   *   In a conditional statement \"If P then Q\", if P is false, the entire statement is true (vacuously true).\n   *   So, for any $r_1 \\in R$ and any $r_2 \\in R$, the statement \"if $r_2$ chortled at $r_1$ then $r_1$ chortled at $r_2$\" is true because the antecedent ($r_2$ chortled at $r_1$) is always false.\n   *   Since there is at least one rath (Fact 1), we can pick any rath for $r_1$. For that $r_1$, the condition holds for all $r_2$.\n   *   Therefore, this statement must be **True**.\n\n**4. Every rath chortled at a rath.**\n   *   This means: $\\forall r_1 \\in R, \\exists r_2 \\in R \\text{ such that } r_1 \\text{ chortled at } r_2$.\n   *   According to Fact 3, for any $r_1 \\in R$, it is false that $r_1$ chortled at *any* $r_2 \\in R$.\n   *   Therefore, it's impossible for every rath to have chortled at a rath.\n   *   This statement must be **False**.\n\n**5. There is a rath that every rath chortled at.**\n   *   This means: $\\exists r_1 \\in R \\text{ such that } \\forall r_2 \\in R, r_2 \\text{ chortled at } r_1$.\n   *   According to Fact 3, for any $r_2 \\in R$ and any $r_1 \\in R$, it is false that $r_2$ chortled at $r_1$.\n   *   Therefore, it's impossible for there to be a rath that every rath chortled at.\n   *   This statement must be **False**.\n\n**6. Every rath chortled at every rath.**\n   *   This means: $\\forall r_1 \\in R, \\forall r_2 \\in R, r_1 \\text{ chortled at } r_2$.\n   *   According to Fact 3, for any $r_1 \\in R$ and any $r_2 \\in R$, it is false that $r_1$ chortled at $r_2$.\n   *   This statement is the direct negation of Fact 3 (if Fact 3 is interpreted as \"it is not the case that any rath chortled at any rath\").\n   *   This statement must be **False**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This part is always true.\n*   \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is given as a direct fact. This part is always true.\n*   The statement is \"True just in case True,\" which means it is **true**.\n\n**4. Zindle and Bungo gimbled.**\n\n*   Similar to statement 1, we have no information that forces Zindle or Bungo to be toves, nor do we have information that forces them to gimble.\n*   This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**5. Zindle didn't gimble.**\n\n*   We know \"Only toves gimbled.\" This means if Zindle gimbled, Zindle must be a tove.\n*   We don't know if Zindle is a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n*   If Zindle is a borogove or a rath, then Zindle didn't gimble (because only toves gimble).\n*   If Zindle is a tove, Zindle *could* have gimbled or *could not* have gimbled. We don't have enough information to determine if Zindle, specifically, gimbled or not.\n*   Therefore, \"Zindle didn't gimble\" is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**6. Zindle gimbled.**\n\n*   Similar to statement 5, we don't know if Zindle is a tove, and even if Zindle is a tove, we don't know if Zindle gimbled.\n*   This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) (exclusively). This means $T \\cup B \\cup R = U$ (the universe of things), and $T \\cap B = \\emptyset$, $T \\cap R = \\emptyset$, $B \\cap R = \\emptyset$.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R). So, $|T| \\ge 1$, $|B| \\ge 1$, $|R| \\ge 1$.\n3.  **Rath Action:** A rath gyred. (This statement seems to be a distractor, as it doesn't connect to the other logical conditions about chortling or mimsiness).\n4.  **Borogove-Rath Interaction:** A borogove chortled at every rath. Let's denote \"X chortled at Y\" as C(X, Y). This means: $\\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } \\forall r \\in R, C(b, r)$.\n5.  **Conditional Statement:** If every borogove is mimsy (M(b) for all $b \\in B$), then Zindle will whiffle (W(Z)) only if every rath chortled at Bungo ($\\forall r \\in R, C(r, \\text{Bungo})$).\n    This can be written as: $(\\forall b \\in B, M(b)) \\implies (W(Z) \\implies (\\forall r \\in R, C(r, \\text{Bungo})))$.\n    This is equivalent to: $(\\forall b \\in B, M(b)) \\implies (\\neg (\\forall r \\in R, C(r, \\text{Bungo})) \\implies \\neg W(Z))$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's focus on the crucial statement: \"A borogove chortled at every rath.\"\nThis translates directly to: $\\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } \\forall r \\in R, C(b, r)$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n1.  **There is a borogove that every rath chortled at.**\n    This statement is: $\\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } \\forall r \\in R, C(r, b)$.\n    This is *not* the same as the given information. The given information states a borogove chortled *at* every rath, not that every rath chortled *at* a borogove. This statement might be true or false; we don't have enough information to confirm it.\n\n2.  **Every borogove chortled at a rath.**\n    This statement is: $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists r \\in R \\text{ such that } C(b, r)$.\n    The given information is $\\exists b_0 \\in B \\text{ such that } \\forall r \\in R, C(b_0, r)$.\n    If there is *one* borogove ($b_0$) that chortled at *every* rath, then for that specific $b_0$, it is true that $b_0$ chortled at *a* rath (in fact, it chortled at all of them).\n    However, the statement says *every* borogove. We only know about one specific borogove. Other borogoves might not have chortled at any rath.\n    For example, if $B = \\{b_1, b_2\\}$ and $R = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$, and $b_1$ chortled at $r_1$ and $r_2$. This satisfies the given condition. But if $b_2$ chortled at no raths, then statement 2 would be false.\n    Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **A borogove chortled at a rath.**\n    This statement is: $\\exists b \\in B, \\exists r \\in R \\text{ such that } C(b, r)$.\n    From the given information: \"A borogove chortled at every rath.\" This means $\\exists b_0 \\in B \\text{ such that } \\forall r \\in R, C(b_0, r)$.\n    Since we know there's at least one rath ($|R| \\ge 1$), let $r_1$ be one such rath.\n    Then, for this $b_0$, it is true that $C(b_0, r_1)$.\n    Therefore, there exists a borogove ($b_0$) and there exists a rath ($r_1$) such that the borogove chortled at the rath.\n    This statement **must be true**.\n\n4.  **No borogoves chortled at every rath.**\n    This statement is: $\\neg (\\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } \\forall r \\in R, C(b, r))$.\n    This is the direct negation of the given information \"A borogove chortled at every rath.\"\n    Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n5.  **Every borogove chortled at every rath.**\n    This statement is: $\\forall b \\in B, \\forall r \\in R, C(b, r)$.\n    The given information is $\\exists b_0 \\in B \\text{ such that } \\forall r \\in R, C(b_0, r)$.\n    This means only *one* borogove (or at least one) is guaranteed to have chortled at every rath. It does not mean *all* borogoves did.\n    For example, if $B = \\{b_1, b_2\\}$ and $R = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$, and $b_1$ chortled at $r_1$ and $r_2$. This satisfies the given condition. But if $b_2$ chortled at no raths, then statement 5 would be false.\n    Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **No borogoves chortled at a rath.**\n    This statement is: $\\neg (\\exists b \\in B, \\exists r \\in R \\text{ such that } C(b, r))$.\n    This is the direct negation of statement 3.\n    Since statement 3 must be true, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is statement 3. The conditional statement about Zindle and mimsy borogoves is irrelevant to the truth of these statements, as its premise is not asserted to be true. The information about \"a rath gyred\" is also irrelevant.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the quantification in \"A borogove chortled at every rath\" ($\\exists b \\forall r, C(b,r)$) and its implications for other quantified statements.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

(This means all borogoves burble. $\\forall b \\in B, b \\in \\text{Burble}$). This statement seems to be a distractor as it doesn't connect to the other conditions.\n6.  **Toves & Mimsy (Exclusive):** ONLY toves are mimsy.\n    *   This means if something is mimsy, it must be a tove.\n    *   Symbolically: $x \\in M \\implies x \\in T$.\n    *   Equivalently, no borogoves are mimsy, and no raths are mimsy.\n    *   Symbolically: $B \\cap M = \\emptyset$ and $R \\cap M = \\emptyset$.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom statement 6 (\"ONLY toves are mimsy\"), we know that no borogoves are mimsy.\nSo, for any borogove $b$, $b \\notin M$.\nThis means the premise of statement 4 (\"A borogove is mimsy\") is false.\nIf the premise of an \"ONLY IF\" statement (which is an implication) is false, the implication itself is true regardless of the conclusion.\nHowever, let's be more precise with statement 4: \"A borogove will be mimsy ONLY IF not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\nLet P be \"A borogove will be mimsy\" ($\\exists b \\in B, b \\in M$).\nLet Q be \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" ($\\neg (\\forall b \\in B, b \\in \\text{SS_Rafin})$).\nThe statement is P $\\implies$ Q.\n\nFrom statement 6, we deduced that P is false (no borogoves are mimsy).\nSince P is false, the implication P $\\implies$ Q is true. This doesn't tell us anything about Q. Q could be true or false.\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" (Q) is true or false from this alone.\n\nLet's re-evaluate statement 4: \"A borogove will be mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\nThis means: If (there exists a borogove that is mimsy), then (it is not the case that all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin).\nFrom statement 6: \"Only toves are mimsy.\" This directly implies that *no borogoves are mimsy*.\nSo, the condition \"A borogove will be mimsy\" is false.\nWhen the antecedent of an \"if...then\" statement is false, the entire statement is true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\nThis means the statement \"A borogove will be mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true, but it doesn't force the consequent (\"not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\") to be true.\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of statement 4:\nIf (all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin), then (no borogove is mimsy).\nWe know from statement 6 that \"no borogove is mimsy\" is true.\nIf the consequent of an \"if...then\" statement is true, the entire statement is true, regardless of the truth value of the antecedent.\nThis means the statement \"If all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, then no borogove is mimsy\" is true, but it doesn't force the antecedent (\"all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\") to be true or false.\n\nSo, the combination of statement 4 and statement 6 does *not* allow us to determine whether \"all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" or \"not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true.\n\nLet's re-read statement 4 carefully: \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\nThis is a tricky phrasing. Let's assume it means:\n(No borogoves are mimsy) $\\implies$ (Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin).\n\nFrom statement 6: \"ONLY toves are mimsy.\"\nThis implies that \"No borogoves are mimsy\" is TRUE.\nLet P = \"No borogoves are mimsy\". (P is True)\nLet Q = \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\".\nThe statement is P $\\implies$ Q.\nSince P is True, for P $\\implies$ Q to be true, Q *must* be true.\nTherefore, \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be true.\n\nLet's verify this interpretation of \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\nThis phrasing is ambiguous. It could mean:\n1.  (No borogoves are mimsy) $\\implies$ (Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin) - This is the interpretation I just used.\n2.  (Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin) $\\implies$ (No borogoves are mimsy) - This is the \"only if\" structure where \"A only if B\" means A $\\implies$ B. So, \"No borogoves are mimsy\" is the consequent.\n\nLet's try interpretation 2, which is the standard logical interpretation of \"A only if B\" as A $\\implies$ B.\nLet A = \"No borogoves are mimsy\".\nLet B = \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\".\nThe statement is A $\\implies$ B.\nFrom statement 6, \"ONLY toves are mimsy\", we deduce that \"No borogoves are mimsy\" (A) is TRUE.\nIf A is TRUE, and A $\\implies$ B is TRUE (which it must be, as it's a given premise), then B *must* be TRUE.\nSo, \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" (B) must be true.\n\nLet's re-read the original text for statement 4: \"A borogove will burble and only toves are mimsy. No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\nThe sentence structure is: \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\nThis is of the form \"X only if Y\", which means X $\\implies$ Y.\nHere, X = \"No borogoves are mimsy\".\nAnd Y = \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\".\n\nFrom the last part of the problem statement: \"A borogove will burble and only toves are mimsy.\"\nThis tells us two things:\n*   All borogoves burble. (Irrelevant to the options)\n*   Only toves are mimsy. This means if something is mimsy, it's a tove. This implies that no borogoves are mimsy. So, \"No borogoves are mimsy\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's apply this to statement 4:\n\"No borogoves are mimsy\" (which is TRUE) \"only if\" \"not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\".\nSince \"No borogoves are mimsy\" is true, and the implication \" (No borogoves are mimsy) $\\implies$ (Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin) \" must hold (as it's a given premise), it logically follows that \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be true.\n\nSo, statement 4 implies that \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true.\n\nNow let's check the options:\n\n1.  **A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.** (This means at least one borogove snicker-snacked Rafin). This is compatible with \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\". It could be true, but not necessarily.\n2.  **No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.** This is the negation of \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\". This is also compatible with \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" (if none did, then certainly not all did). It could be true, but not necessarily.\n3.  **Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove.** This is about Rafin's action, not the borogoves' action. The given information is about what toves/borogoves/raths did. We have no information about what Rafin did. Cannot be determined.\n4.  **Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.** As derived above, this must be true.\n5.  **Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.** Again, about Rafin's action. Cannot be determined.\n6.  **Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.** This is the negation of \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\". Since \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be true, this statement must be false.\n\nTherefore, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nFinal check of the interpretation of \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\nThis is a complex sentence. Let's consider the possibility that \"No borogoves are mimsy\" is a condition for the \"only if\"",

Let's analyze each one.\n\n**Statement 1: Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n*   $\\forall t (IsT(t) \\implies \\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies G(t, b)))$\n\nFrom Axiom 2: $\\forall x (IsB(x) \\implies \\forall y (IsT(y) \\implies G(x, y)))$. This means every borogove galumphed over every tove.\nThis is the *opposite* direction of galumphing. There's no information that implies toves galumphed over borogoves.\nConsider a scenario where no tove galumphed over any borogove. This doesn't contradict any of the axioms.\n**Conclusion for Statement 1: False.**\n\n**Statement 2: Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n*   $\\forall t (IsT(t) \\implies \\exists b (IsB(b) \\land G(t, b)))$\n\nSimilar to Statement 1, we only know borogoves galumphed over toves. We don't know anything about toves galumphing over borogoves.\n**Conclusion for Statement 2: False.**\n\n**Statement 3: No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n*   $\\neg \\exists t (IsT(t) \\land \\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies G(t, b)))$\n*   This is equivalent to: $\\forall t (IsT(t) \\implies \\exists b (IsB(b) \\land \\neg G(t, b)))$\n\nThis statement claims that for every tove, there's at least one borogove that the tove *didn't* galumph over.\nAgain, the axioms only specify borogoves galumphing over toves. They don't restrict toves from galumphing over borogoves, nor do they require it.\nWe can construct a model where a tove *does* galumph over every borogove without contradicting the axioms.\nFor example, let there be one Tove (T1) and one Borogove (B1).\nAxiom 2: G(B1, T1).\nIf we add G(T1, B1), it doesn't contradict any axiom. In this case, T1 galumphed over every borogove (since B1 is the only one). So, Statement 3 would be false in this model.\nSince we found a counterexample, Statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n**Conclusion for Statement 3: False.**\n\n**Statement 4: A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n*   $\\exists t \\exists b (IsT(t) \\land IsB(b) \\land G(t, b))$\n\nThis is an existential claim. Similar to the previous statements, we have no information that forces a tove to galumph over a borogove.\n**Conclusion for Statement 4: False.**\n\n**Statement 5: There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.**\n*   $\\exists t (IsT(t) \\land \\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies G(b, t)))$\n\nLet's look at Axiom 2: $\\forall x (IsB(x) \\implies \\forall y (IsT(y) \\implies G(x, y)))$.\nThis axiom states: \"Every borogove galumphed over every tove.\"\nThis means that for any borogove `b` and any tove `t`, `G(b, t)` is true.\nSo, if we pick *any* tove `t_0` (and we know at least one tove exists from Axiom 1), then for *every* borogove `b`, it must be true that `G(b, t_0)`.\nTherefore, there exists a tove (in fact, every tove) such that every borogove galumphed over it.\n**Conclusion for Statement 5: True.**\n\n**Statement 6: A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n*   $\\exists t (IsT(t) \\land \\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies G(t, b)))$\n\nThis is the same as Statement 3's negation, and the same as Statement 3's counterexample.\nWe found that Statement 3 is false, meaning its negation *could* be true. But \"could be true\" is not \"must be true\".\nWe have no information that forces a tove to galumph over every borogove.\n**Conclusion for Statement 6: False.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet's re-verify Statement 5.\nAxiom 2: \"Every borogove galumphed over every tove.\"\nFormally: $\\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies \\forall t (IsT(t) \\implies G(b, t)))$\n\nStatement 5: \"There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.\"\nFormally: $\\exists t_0 (IsT(t_0) \\land \\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies G(b, t_0)))$\n\nSince we know $\\exists t (IsT(t))$ (from Axiom 1, there's at least one tove), let's pick an arbitrary tove, say `t_k`.\nFrom Axiom 2, for this `t_k`, it must be true that $\\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies G(b, t_k))$.\nThis directly matches the second part of the conjunction in Statement 5.\nSince we know `IsT(t_k)` is true, and we've shown `$\\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies G(b, t_k))$` is true for `t_k`, then the conjunction `$(IsT(t_k) \\land \\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies G(b, t_k)))$` is true.\nSince we found such a `t_k`, the existential statement `$\\exists t_0 (IsT(t_0) \\land \\forall b (IsB(b) \\implies G(b, t_0)))$` is true.\n\nTherefore, Statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This means it's *not* the case that every single borogove galumphed over Bungo.

The given information is about borogoves galumphing over Bungo. This statement is not supported by the premises.\n\n3.  **Not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   As derived from the conditional statement and premise (4), this statement **must be true**.\n\n4.  **Every borogove galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   This is the direct negation of statement 3. Since statement 3 must be true, this statement **must be false**.\n\n5.  **Bungo galumphed over a borogove.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, this is about Bungo's action, not borogoves' actions. Not supported by the premises.\n\n6.  **No borogoves galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   This is a possibility consistent with \"not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo\" (if none did, then it's certainly not true that *all* did).\n    *   However, it's not the *only* possibility. \"Not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo\" also allows for the case where *some* borogoves galumphed over Bungo, but at least one did not.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the logical deduction from the given premises, only statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This means `\u2200x (B(x) \u2192 \u00acBM(x))`.\n    *   If no borogoves are beamish, then it's impossible for *only* borogoves to be beamish, because it implies that *some* borogoves *are* beamish (or at least that the set of beamish things is a subset of borogoves, which would be empty if no borogoves are beamish).\n    *   If `NB_BM` is true, then the set of beamish things and the set of borogoves are disjoint. If the set of beamish things is non-empty, then those beamish things *cannot* be borogoves. If the set of beamish things is empty, then \"only borogoves are beamish\" would be vacuously true if there are no beamish things, but it also implies that if something is beamish, it's a borogove.\n    *   More simply: If \"No borogoves are beamish\" is true, then the statement \"Only borogoves are beamish\" is false, unless there are no beamish things at all. Even if there are no beamish things, the statement \"Only borogoves are beamish\" implies that if something *were* beamish, it would be a borogove. But we know no borogoves are beamish. This creates a contradiction if there are any beamish things.\n    *   Let's assume \"Only borogoves are beamish\" is true. This means `BM(x) \u2192 B(x)`.\n    *   We know `B(x) \u2192 \u00acBM(x)`.\n    *   If there is any `x` such that `BM(x)`, then `B(x)` must be true. But if `B(x)` is true, then `\u00acBM(x)` must be true. This is a contradiction (`BM(x) \u2227 \u00acBM(x)`).\n    *   Therefore, there can be no `x` such that `BM(x)`. In other words, \"Nothing is beamish.\"\n    *   However, the problem doesn't state that nothing is beamish. It's possible that toves or raths are beamish. If a tove is beamish, then \"Only borogoves are beamish\" is false.\n    *   Since we know \"No borogoves are beamish\", it means that if anything *is* beamish, it *cannot* be a borogove. This directly contradicts \"Only borogoves are beamish\" unless nothing is beamish.

If no borogoves are beamish, then it's certainly true that not all borogoves are beamish.\n    *   However, since the first part of the conjunction (\"Only borogoves are beamish\") is false, the entire conjunction is false.\n    *   **FALSE.**\n\n6.  **Every borogove is beamish.**\n    *   **FALSE.** This is the direct opposite of \"No borogoves are beamish,\" which we deduced to be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the deductions, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

Since G_R_not_Rafin is true, this conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about G_Z_not_Bungo. It could be true or false. (If A -> B and B is true, A can be true or false).\n\n*   Consider statement (4): SS_R_Rafin -> SS_B_not_Bungo. We know G_R_not_Rafin (Not all raths galumphed over Rafin). This is *not* the same as SS_R_Rafin (Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin). These are different actions. So, we cannot directly infer anything about SS_R_Rafin from G_R_not_Rafin.\n\n*   Consider statement (6): B_Z_not -> (G_T_not_Bungo -> G_R_Rafin).\n    *   We know G_R_not_Rafin is true. This means G_R_Rafin is false.\n    *   So, the consequent (G_T_not_Bungo -> G_R_Rafin) becomes (G_T_not_Bungo -> False).\n    *   For (G_T_not_Bungo -> False) to be true, G_T_not_Bungo must be false.\n    *   Therefore, G_T_not_Bungo is false, which means G_T_Bungo (All toves galumphed over Bungo) is true.\n    *   Now, we have B_Z_not -> (False). For this implication to be true, B_Z_not must be false.\n    *   If B_Z_not (Zindle won't burble) is false, then B_Z (Zindle will burble) must be true.\n\n**Summary of what we've deduced must be true:**\n\n*   G_R_not_Rafin (Not all raths galumphed over Rafin)\n*   not_U_Rafin (Rafin isn't uffish)\n*   B_Z (Zindle will burble)\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n1.  **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin and a rath is uffish.**\n    *   \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin\" is true (G_R_not_Rafin).\n    *   \"a rath is uffish\" (U_Rath) - We have no information about whether any rath is uffish. We only know Rafin isn't uffish. This statement *might* be true, but it doesn't *must* be true.\n\n2.  **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n    *   \"Zindle will burble\" is true (B_Z).\n    *   \"Rafin will burble\" - We have no information about Rafin's bubbling. This statement *might* be true, but it doesn't *must* be true.\n\n3.  **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin is uffish.**\n    *   \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin\" is true (G_R_not_Rafin).\n    *   \"it is not the case that Rafin is uffish\" is equivalent to \"Rafin isn't uffish\", which is true (not_U_Rafin).\n    *   Since both conjuncts are true, this entire statement must be true.\n\n4.  **Zindle will burble.**\n    *   This is true (B_Z), as deduced above.\n\n5.  **Every rath galumphed over Rafin and a rath is uffish.**\n    *   \"Every rath galumphed over Rafin\" (G_R_Rafin) is false, because we know G_R_not_Rafin is true.\n    *   Since the first part is false, the entire conjunction is false. This statement must be false.\n\n6.  **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin and Rafin is uffish.**\n    *   \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin\" is true (G_R_not_Rafin).\n    *   \"Rafin is uffish\" (U_Rafin) is false, because we know not_U_Rafin is true.\n    *   Since the second part is false, the entire conjunction is false. This statement must be false.\n\n**Revisiting the options for \"must be true\":**\n\n*   Option 1: \"a rath is uffish\" is unknown.\n*   Option 2: \"Rafin will burble\" is unknown.\n*   Option 3: Both parts are true based on our deductions.\n*   Option 4: This is true based on our deductions.\n\nWe are looking for *which* of the following statements *must* be true. If multiple options are true, we list all of them.\n\nBoth statement 3 and statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{3 and 4}}$",

(\u2203b (b will not whiffle))\n        *   It *does not* mean that *no* borogoves will whiffle. It's possible some will and some won't.\n    *   \"every tove will whiffle\" (\u2200t (t will whiffle))\n        *   Since there's at least one tove, we know **a tove will whiffle**.\n\n3.  **Bungo Galumphing and Rath Actions (Conditional):**\n    *   \"If Bungo galumphed over Bungo, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\"\n    *   Let P = \"Bungo galumphed over Bungo\"\n    *   Let Q = \"every rath chortled at Bungo\"\n    *   Let R = \"no raths galumphed over Bungo\"\n    *   The statement is: P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R)\n    *   We don't know if Bungo galumphed over Bungo, so this conditional doesn't immediately tell us anything definitive about Bungo's galumphing or rath actions.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\nWe know for sure:\n*   **Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n*   **Not all borogoves will whiffle.** (meaning \u2203b (b will not whiffle))\n*   **Every tove will whiffle.** (meaning \u2200t (t will whiffle))\n\nLet's check each statement:\n\n*   **1. Bungo chortled at Bungo and not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n    *   \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" - True (from step 1)\n    *   \"not all borogoves will whiffle\" - True (given directly)\n    *   **This statement must be true.**\n\n*   **2. Bungo chortled at Bungo and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n    *   \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" - True\n    *   \"no borogoves will whiffle\" - This means \u2200b (b will not whiffle). This is stronger than \"not all borogoves will whiffle\". \"Not all borogoves will whiffle\" allows for *some* borogoves to whiffle. We cannot conclude that *no* borogoves will whiffle.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **3. Bungo chortled at Bungo and only borogoves will whiffle.**\n    *   \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" - True\n    *   \"only borogoves will whiffle\" - This implies that if something whiffling, it must be a borogove. But we know \"every tove will whiffle\". Since there's at least one tove, and toves are not borogoves (exclusively), this part of the statement is false.\n    *   **This statement is not true.**\n\n*   **4. Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and a borogove will whiffle.**\n    *   \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" - False (we established Bungo *did* chortle at Bungo).\n    *   **This statement is not true.**\n\n*   **5. Bungo chortled at Bungo and a borogove will whiffle.**\n    *   \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" - True\n    *   \"a borogove will whiffle\" - We know \"not all borogoves will whiffle\", which means *at least one* borogove will *not* whiffle. This does not tell us if *any* borogoves *will* whiffle. It's possible that some will and some won't, or it's possible that none will. We cannot definitively say \"a borogove will whiffle\".\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **6. Bungo will whiffle.**\n    *   We have no information about Bungo's whiffling. Bungo is not stated to be a tove, borogove, or rath. Even if Bungo were one of them, we don't have enough information to determine if Bungo will whiffle.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Borogoves & Zindle (Chortling):** \"No borogoves chortled at Zindle.\" This is a crucial negative statement.\n4.  **Borogoves & Beamish:** \"Not all borogoves are beamish.\" This means there's at least one borogove that is *not* beamish. (This statement seems irrelevant to the options provided, but it's part of the given info).\n5.  **Toves & Gyring:** \"Every tove gyred.\" (Also seems irrelevant to the options).\n6.  **Conditional Statement (Zindle, Rath, Borogove):** \"If Zindle won't burble (\u00acBurble_Z), then every rath galumphed over Rafin (Galumphed_R) only if every borogove chortled at Bungo (Chortled_Bungo).\"\n    *   This can be written as: \u00acBurble_Z \u2192 (Galumphed_R \u2192 Chortled_Bungo)\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's re-examine the crucial statement: \"No borogoves chortled at Zindle.\"\n\nThis means: For any entity X, if X is a borogove, then X did *not* chortle at Zindle.\nIn other words, there isn't a single borogove that chortled at Zindle.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **1. A borogove chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No borogoves chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n*   **2. Not all borogoves chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   If \"No borogoves chortled at Zindle,\" it means *zero* borogoves chortled at Zindle.\n    *   If zero borogoves chortled at Zindle, then it is certainly true that \"not all borogoves chortled at Zindle\" (because none did).\n    *   This statement must be **true**.\n\n*   **3. Zindle chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   The given information is about borogoves chortling *at Zindle*, not Zindle chortling *at borogoves*. We have no information about Zindle's actions.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot determine if this is true or false. It is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **4. Every borogove chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No borogoves chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n*   **5. Zindle will burble.**\n    *   We have the conditional: \u00acBurble_Z \u2192 (Galumphed_R \u2192 Chortled_Bungo).\n    *   We know nothing about whether Zindle will burble or not. We also know nothing about Galumphed_R or Chortled_Bungo.\n    *   We cannot deduce whether Zindle will burble. It is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **6. Zindle chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, this is about Zindle's actions, not borogoves' actions towards Zindle. We have no information about Zindle chortling at anything.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot determine if this is true or false. It is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 2 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

If T1 SS R1, then R1 SS T1.\n*   **Chortled (C):**\n    *   \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" (\u00acC(Bungo, Bungo)).\n    *   \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" (\u00ac(\u00acC(Rafin, Bungo))) which simplifies to \"Rafin chortled at Bungo\" (C(Rafin, Bungo)).\n    *   \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" (\u2203x (x is B \u2227 C(x, Rafin))).\n*   **Gimbled (G):** \"only toves gimbled.\" This means if something gimbled, it must be a tove. (G(x) \u2192 x is T).\n\n**Derived Facts:**\n\nFrom the \"Chortled\" information:\n*   **F1:** \u00acC(Bungo, Bungo)\n*   **F2:** C(Rafin, Bungo)\n*   **F3:** \u2203x (x is B \u2227 C(x, Rafin)) (A borogove chortled at Rafin)\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n*   \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" is **F3**, which is true.\n*   \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is \u00acC(Bungo, Bungo), which is **F1**, and is true.\n*   Since both parts are true, the conjunction is true.\n*   **Statement 1 is TRUE.**\n\n**Statement 2: A borogove chortled at Rafin and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n*   \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" is **F3**, which is true.\n*   \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is \u00acC(Rafin, Bungo). However, we know from **F2** that C(Rafin, Bungo) is true. Therefore, \u00acC(Rafin, Bungo) is false.\n*   Since one part of the conjunction is false, the entire statement is false.\n*   **Statement 2 is FALSE.**\n\n**Statement 3: Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This is a biconditional: C(Rafin, Rafin) \u2194 \u2203x (x is B \u2227 C(x, Bungo)).\n*   We have no information about C(Rafin, Rafin).\n*   We have no information about whether a borogove chortled at Bungo.\n*   Since we don't know the truth value of either side of the biconditional, we cannot determine if this statement must be true. It *could* be true, or it *could* be false, depending on unknown facts.\n*   **Statement 3 is NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.**\n\n**Statement 4: Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This is a biconditional: C(Rafin, Rafin) \u2194 \u00ac(\u2200x (x is B \u2192 C(x, Bungo))).\n*   Again, we have no information about C(Rafin, Rafin).\n*   We have no information about whether all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n*   Since we don't know the truth value of either side of the biconditional, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n*   **Statement 4 is NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.**\n\n**Statement 5: A borogove chortled at Rafin and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n*   \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" is **F3**, which is true.\n*   \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is C(Bungo, Bungo). However, we know from **F1** that \u00acC(Bungo, Bungo) is true. Therefore, C(Bungo, Bungo) is false.\n*   Since one part of the conjunction is false, the entire statement is false.\n*   **Statement 5 is FALSE.**\n\n**Statement 6: A borogove chortled at Bungo just in case Rafin chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This is a biconditional: \u2203x (x is B \u2227 C(x, Bungo)) \u2194 C(Rafin, Bungo).\n*   We know from **F2** that C(Rafin, Bungo) is true.\n*   So the statement becomes: \u2203x (x is B \u2227 C(x, Bungo)) \u2194 TRUE.\n*   For this biconditional to be true, the left side (\u2203x (x is B \u2227 C(x, Bungo))) must also be true.\n*   However, we have no information that requires a borogove to chortle at Bungo. It's possible no borogove chortled at Bungo, in which case the left side would be false, making the biconditional false.\n*   Since we don't know the truth value of the left side, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n*   **Statement 6 is NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

It's not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Every tove galumphed over Bungo.**\n*   The given information states: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n*   This means: For all x, if x is a tove, then x did not galumph over Bungo.\n*   Statement 4 says the exact opposite: For all x, if x is a tove, then x *did* galumph over Bungo.\n*   Therefore, Statement 4 must be **false**. Since the question asks what *must be true*, this is not the answer.\n\n**Statement 5: Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n*   The given information states: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n*   This means that for *every single tove*, it did *not* galumph over Bungo.\n*   If no toves galumphed over Bungo, then it is certainly true that it's not the case that *all* toves galumphed over Bungo. In fact, *zero* toves galumphed over Bungo.\n*   This statement is a direct logical consequence of \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n*   Therefore, Statement 5 must be **true**.\n\n**Statement 6: A tove galumphed over Bungo.**\n*   The given information states: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n*   This means there is *not* a single tove that galumphed over Bungo.\n*   Statement 6 says: There exists at least one tove that galumphed over Bungo.\n*   This is the direct negation of \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 must be **false**.

So Bungo is either a tove or a borogove.\n\n*   **Consider the implications of Zindle's type:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: Zindle is a rath (Zindle $\\in$ R).**\n        *   From (2), if Zindle is a rath, then Zindle chortled at Zindle. (This is a bit self-referential but doesn't contradict anything yet).\n        *   From (5), Zindle isn't mimsy. This is consistent.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Zindle is a tove (Zindle $\\in$ T).**\n        *   From (5), Zindle isn't mimsy. This is consistent.\n\n    *   **Case 3: Zindle is a borogove (Zindle $\\in$ B).**\n        *   From (5), $\\neg$ M(Zindle).\n        *   From (4), if Zindle is a borogove, then M(Zindle) $\\iff \\neg (\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo))$.\n        *   Since $\\neg$ M(Zindle), it must be that $\\neg (\\neg (\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo)))$, which means $(\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo))$.\n        *   So, if Zindle is a borogove, then *all* borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n\n*   **Now let's look at Rafin.** We don't know Rafin's type or mimsiness directly, except for (3): Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n*   **Consider the possibility of Rafin being a borogove:**\n    *   If Rafin is a borogove (Rafin $\\in$ B), then from (3), Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n    *   This means $\\neg C(\\text{Rafin, Bungo})$.\n    *   If Rafin is a borogove, then it is *not* true that all borogoves chortled at Bungo (because Rafin, a borogove, didn't). So, $\\neg (\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo))$.\n    *   From (4), for any borogove x, M(x) $\\iff \\neg (\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo))$.\n    *   Since we just deduced $\\neg (\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo))$, it must be that M(x) is true for all borogoves x.\n    *   Therefore, if Rafin is a borogove, then Rafin is mimsy (M(Rafin)). And *all* borogoves are mimsy.\n\n*   **Combining Zindle's type and Rafin's type:**\n\n    *   **Scenario A: Zindle is a borogove.**\n        *   As deduced above, if Zindle is a borogove, then *all* borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n        *   But we know Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo (from 3).\n        *   This means Rafin cannot be a borogove in this scenario, because if Rafin were a borogove, it would contradict \"all borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\n        *   So, if Zindle is a borogove, then Rafin is either a tove or a rath.\n        *   If Rafin is a rath, then from (2), Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n        *   If Rafin is a tove, we know nothing about its chortling or mimsiness.\n\n    *   **Scenario B: Zindle is NOT a borogove.** (So Zindle is a tove or a rath).\n        *   In this scenario, we don't have the deduction that all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n        *   Now, let's consider Rafin. We know Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n        *   If Rafin is a borogove, then $\\neg (\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo))$ is true (because Rafin is a borogove and didn't chortle at Bungo).\n        *   From (4), this implies that *all* borogoves are mimsy. So, if Rafin is a borogove, then Rafin is mimsy.\n        *   Also, if Rafin is a borogove, and all borogoves are mimsy, then Zindle cannot be a borogove (because Zindle isn't mimsy). This is consistent with Scenario B.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the core implications:**\n\n1.  **Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.** (Given)\n2.  **Zindle isn't mimsy.** (Given)\n3.  **Bungo is not a rath.** (Given)\n\nConsider the statement: \"Every borogove is mimsy if and only if not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\"\n\n*   Let P be \"Every borogove is mimsy.\" ($\\forall x \\in B, M(x)$)\n*   Let Q be \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\" ($\\neg (\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo))$)\n*   The rule is: P $\\iff$ Q.\n\nWe know Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n*   If Rafin is a borogove, then Q must be true (because Rafin is a borogove and didn't chortle at Bungo, so it's not true that *all* borogoves chortled at Bungo).\n*   If Q is true, then P must be true (from P $\\iff$ Q). So, \"Every borogove is mimsy.\"\n*   If \"Every borogove is mimsy\" is true, then Zindle cannot be a borogove (because Zindle isn't mimsy).\n*   Therefore, if Rafin is a borogove, then Zindle is either a tove or a rath. And Rafin is mimsy.\n\nWhat if Rafin is *not* a borogove?\n*   If Rafin is a tove or a rath, then Rafin's chortling (or lack thereof) doesn't directly affect the \"all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" condition.\n*   In this case, Q could be true or false.\n    *   If Q is true ($\\neg (\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo))$), then P is true ($\\forall x \\in B, M(x)$). This would mean Zindle is not a borogove.\n    *   If Q is false ($\\forall y \\in B, C(y, Bungo)$), then P is false ($\\neg (\\forall x \\in B, M(x))$). This means at least one borogove is not mimsy. This is consistent with Zindle being a borogove (since Zindle isn't mimsy).\n\nLet's try to find a contradiction if any of the options are false.\n\n**Let's analyze the options:**\n\n1.  **Zindle isn't mimsy but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n    *   \"Zindle isn't mimsy\" is given (5).\n    *   \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" means \"Rafin chortled at Bungo\".\n    *   This contradicts given (3) \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\".\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 **must be false**.\n\n2.  **Zindle isn't mimsy and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n    *   \"Zindle isn't mimsy\" is given (5).\n    *   \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is given (3).\n    *   Both parts are explicitly given as true.\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 **must be true**.\n\nLet's check the other options just to be thorough, even though we found a definite answer.\n\n3.  **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.**\n    *   We know Zindle isn't mimsy (5).\n    *   Therefore, statement 3 **must be false**.\n\n4.  **Rafin is",

This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets, and their union covers everything.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Toves & Borogoves (Snicker-snacking):** \"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\" This is a crucial negative statement. It means for any Tove 't' and any Borogove 'b', 't' did not snicker-snack 'b'.\n    *   Symbolically: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\neg (t \\text{ snicker-snacked } b)$.\n4.  **Borogoves & Mimsy (Conditional):** \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\" This is a complex conditional, but its antecedent (\"not all borogoves are mimsy\") is not given as true or false, and its consequent involves specific individuals (Rafin, Bungo) and an action (snicker-snacking). This statement might be a distractor or only relevant if we knew more about mimsiness or Bungo.\n5.  **Borogove & Rafin (Chortling):** \"A borogove chortled at Rafin.\" This tells us about chortling, not snicker-snacking.\n6.  **Rafin's Category:** \"Rafin is a tove.\" So, Rafin $\\in T$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements based on the Given Information, especially point 3:**\n\nThe most direct and powerful piece of information regarding \"snicker-snacking\" between toves and borogoves is: **\"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\"**\n\nLet's rephrase this:\n*   It is *never* the case that a tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\n*   For any tove 't' and any borogove 'b', the action \"t snicker-snacked b\" did not happen.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n*   This means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, (t \\text{ snicker-snacked } b)$.\n*   This directly contradicts \"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 1 must be **false**.\n\n**2. Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n*   This means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, (t \\text{ snicker-snacked } b)$.\n*   This implies that for *each* tove, there is *at least one* borogove that it snicker-snacked.\n*   This contradicts \"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove\" (which says no tove snicker-snacked *any* borogove).\n*   Therefore, statement 2 must be **false**.\n\n**3. A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n*   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, (t \\text{ snicker-snacked } b)$.\n*   This implies that there exists *at least one* instance where a tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\n*   This directly contradicts \"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 3 must be **false**.\n\n**4. There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.**\n*   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, (t \\text{ snicker-snacked } b)$.\n*   This implies that there is *some specific* tove 't' such that for *every single* borogove 'b', 't' snicker-snacked 'b'.\n*   If such a 't' existed, then for any 'b', 't' would have snicker-snacked 'b'. This would mean 't' snicker-snacked *a* borogove.\n*   This contradicts \"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\"\n*   Therefore, statement 4 must be **false**.\n\n**5. A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n*   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, (t \\text{ snicker-snacked } b)$.\n*   This is identical to statement 4.\n*   Therefore, statement 5 must be **false**.\n\n**6. No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n*   This means: $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, (t \\text{ snicker-snacked } b))$.\n*   This is the negation of statement 5 (and 4).\n*   Since statement 5 (and 4) must be false, its negation must be true.\n*   Let's verify: If it's true that \"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove\" (our given information), then it's certainly true that there isn't even one tove that snicker-snacked *every* borogove (because it didn't snicker-snack *any* borogove).\n*   Therefore, statement 6 must be **true**.\n\nThe information about Rafin being a tove and a borogove chortling at Rafin, and the conditional about mimsy borogoves, are all irrelevant to the snicker-snacking relationship between toves and borogoves, which is directly stated as \"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

(This means *at least one rath did not chortle at Bungo*).\n4.  **Toves & Snicker-snacking/Chortling:** Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Bungo chortled at Bungo. (This is a bit tricky. It means it's *not true* that (all toves snicker-snacked Zindle AND Bungo chortled at Bungo). This implies either:\n    *   Some toves did not snicker-snack Zindle, OR\n    *   Bungo did not chortle at Bungo.\n    *   However, the phrasing \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is redundant if Bungo is the subject. It's more likely \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, and Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" Let's re-read carefully: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" This is a single statement about toves. It means: It is NOT the case that (all toves snicker-snacked Zindle AND Bungo chortled at Bungo).\n    *   Let's assume the more natural reading: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, and Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" This means:\n        *   There is at least one tove that did not snicker-snack Zindle.\n        *   Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n    *   If it means \"Not all (toves snicker-snacked Zindle AND Bungo chortled at Bungo)\", then it's $\\neg (\\forall t (S(t, Z)) \\land C(B, B))$. This means $\\exists t (\\neg S(t, Z)) \\lor \\neg C(B, B)$.\n    *   Let's consider the most straightforward interpretation of \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" as a fact. If Bungo chortled at Bungo, then the \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Bungo chortled at Bungo\" simplifies to \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (because the second part of the conjunction is true, so the negation of the conjunction depends only on the first part).\n    *   Let's assume \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is a separate, established fact from this sentence.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" This is a single statement.

We only know Bungo isn't mimsy. This cannot be deduced.\n\n2.  **Bungo chortled at every rath.** ($\\forall x (R(x) \\implies C(B, x))$)\n    *   We know \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo\" (from 3). This means $\\exists x (R(x) \\land \\neg C(x, B))$.\n    *   We have no information about Bungo chortling at other raths. This cannot be deduced.\n\n3.  **No raths chortled at Bungo.** ($\\forall x (R(x) \\implies \\neg C(x, B))$)\n    *   We know \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo\" (from 3). This means $\\exists x (R(x) \\land \\neg C(x, B))$. This statement is consistent with \"No raths chortled at Bungo\" but does not *force* it. It only forces *at least one* rath not to chortle at Bungo.\n    *   However, consider the possibility that Bungo chortled at Bungo. If Bungo is a rath (which it is, from 6), and Bungo chortled at Bungo, then \"A rath chortled at Bungo\" would be true. This would contradict \"No raths chortled at Bungo\".\n    *   Let's re-examine statement (4): \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Bungo chortled at Bungo.\"\n        *   If this means $(\\neg \\forall t (S(t, Z))) \\land C(B, B)$, then it implies $C(B, B)$ (Bungo chortled at Bungo).\n        *   Since Bungo is a rath (from 6), this means \"A rath (Bungo) chortled at Bungo\".\n        *   If \"A rath chortled at Bungo\" is true, then \"No raths chortled at Bungo\" must be false.\n    *   Let's assume the other interpretation of (4): $\\neg (\\forall t (S(t, Z)) \\land C(B, B))$. This means $\\exists t (\\neg S(t, Z)) \\lor \\neg C(B, B)$.\n        *   In this case, we don't *know* that $C(B, B)$ is true. It could be false. If $C(B, B)$ is false, then Bungo (a rath) did not chortle at Bungo. This would be consistent with \"No raths chortled at Bungo\".\n        *   However, if $C(B, B)$ is true, then \"A rath chortled at Bungo\" is true, and \"No raths chortled at Bungo\" is false.\n    *   The phrasing \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is most naturally read as a conjunction of two facts: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" AND \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\". If this is the case, then $C(B, B)$ is true.\n    *   Let's proceed with the assumption that $C(B, B)$ is true based on the most natural reading of (4).\n    *   If $C(B, B)$ is true, and Bungo is a rath, then \"A rath chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, \"No raths chortled at Bungo\" must be false. So, statement 3 is false.\n\n4.  **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.** ($M(Z) \\land M(B)$)\n    *   We know Bungo isn't mimsy (from 5). So $M(B)$ is false.\n    *   Therefore, the conjunction \"$M(Z) \\land M(B)$\" must be false. This statement cannot be true.\n\n5.  **A rath chortled at Bungo.** ($\\exists x (R(x) \\land C(x, B))$)\n    *   As discussed above, if we assume the natural reading of (4) which implies \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" ($C(B, B)$), and we know Bungo is a rath ($R(B)$ from 6), then $R(B) \\land C(B, B)$ is true.\n    *   This means \"A rath (Bungo) chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n    *   Let's consider if the other interpretation of (4) changes this. If (4) is $\\neg (\\forall t (S(t, Z)) \\land C(B, B))$, then we have $\\exists t (\\neg S(t, Z)) \\lor \\neg C(B, B)$. This means we don't *know* if $C(B, B)$ is true or false.\n    *   If $C(B, B)$ is false, then Bungo (a rath) did not chortle at Bungo.\n    *   However, statement (3) says \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo\". This means $\\exists x (R(x) \\land \\neg C(x, B))$. This does not tell us anything about whether *any* rath chortled at Bungo.\n    *   Let's re-read the problem carefully for any ambiguity. \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" This phrasing is a bit unusual if it's meant to be a single negated conjunction. If it were, it would typically be \"It is not the case that (all toves snicker-snacked Zindle AND Bungo chortled at Bungo)\". The current phrasing \"Not all X and Y\" usually means \"(Not all X) AND Y\".\n    *   Let's assume the most common grammatical interpretation: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\"",

It means for any Tove 't', 't C Rafin' is false.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **1. Rafin chortled at every tove.**\n    *   This statement is about Rafin chortling at toves. Our premises don't give us information about Rafin chortling at toves.\n    *   Premise 5 states \"No toves chortled at Rafin\". This is the *reverse* direction.\n    *   We cannot deduce this.\n\n*   **2. Not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   Premise 5 explicitly states: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\"\n    *   If *no* toves chortled at Rafin, then it is certainly true that *not all* toves chortled at Rafin. (In fact, *zero* toves chortled at Rafin).\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **3. Every tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This directly contradicts Premise 5: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\"\n    *   This statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **4. No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n    *   We know \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" is true from Premise 5.\n    *   Now we need to determine if \"Rafin isn't a tove\" must be true.\n    *   We know Rafin is Uffish (Premise 3).\n    *   We know \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" (Premise 5).\n    *   Could Rafin be a tove? If Rafin *were* a tove, then \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" would mean that Rafin (as a tove) did not chortle at itself. This is perfectly consistent.\n    *   Premise 3 says \"A borogove is uffish and Rafin is uffish.\" This means Rafin *could* be a borogove. But it doesn't *have* to be. Toves or Raths could also be uffish.\n    *   There is no information that forces Rafin to *not* be a tove. For example, if Toves can be uffish, and a Tove cannot chortle at itself, then Rafin could be a Tove.\n    *   Since we cannot definitively say \"Rafin isn't a tove\", this entire conjunction does not *must* be true.\n\n*   **5. A tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This directly contradicts Premise 5: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\"\n    *   This statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **6. Rafin chortled at a tove.**\n    *   This is similar to statement 1. It's about Rafin chortling at toves.\n    *   Premise 5 states \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" (t C Rafin is false for all t).

(This statement seems irrelevant to the relationships between toves and raths, so we can likely ignore it for this problem).\n*   **Tove-Rath Interaction:** A tove snicker-snacked every rath. (Let's call this specific tove T_0).\n*   **Tove Self-Interaction:** A tove snicker-snacked itself. (Let's call this specific tove T_1).\n\n**Analysis of Key Information:**\n\n1.  **\"A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\"**\n    This is crucial. It means there exists at least one tove (let's call it T_0) such that for every rath (r), T_0 snicker-snacked r.\n    Since we know there's at least one rath, this implies that T_0 snicker-snacked at least one rath.\n\n2.  **\"A tove snicker-snacked itself.\"**\n    This means there exists at least one tove (let's call it T_1) such that T_1 snicker-snacked T_1. This doesn't directly tell us anything about tove-rath interactions. Note that T_0 and T_1 could be the same tove or different toves.\n\n**Evaluating Each Statement:**\n\nLet's use the notation `X -> Y` to mean \"X snicker-snacked Y\".\n\n*   **From \"A tove snicker-snacked every rath\":**\n    There exists T_0 such that for all r in R, T_0 -> r.\n\n*   **From \"There's at least one rath\":**\n    R is not empty.\n\n---\n\n**1. There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n    This statement means: \"There exists a tove (t) such that for every rath (r), r -> t.\"\n    The given information states \"A tove snicker-snacked every rath\" (T_0 -> r for all r). This is the *opposite* direction of the snicker-snacking relationship. The given information is about a tove being the *snicker-snacker* of all raths, not the *snicker-snacked* by all raths.\n    We have no information to support this. It's possible, but not necessarily true.\n\n**2. No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    This statement means: \"For every tove (t), it is NOT the case that (t snicker-snacked every rath).\"\n    This directly contradicts the given information: \"A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\" We know such a tove (T_0) exists.\n    Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**3. Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    This statement means: \"For every tove (t), there exists at least one rath (r) such that t -> r.\"\n    We know there's at least one tove (T_0) that snicker-snacked *every* rath. So T_0 certainly snicker-snacked *a* rath.\n    However, we don't know this for *every* tove. There could be other toves (e.g., T_x) that didn't snicker-snack any raths. The given information only guarantees the existence of *one* such tove (T_0).\n    Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    This statement means: \"For every tove (t), and for every rath (r), t -> r.\"\n    This is much stronger than what's given. We only know that *one specific* tove (T_0) snicker-snacked every rath. We don't know this for all toves.\n    Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    This statement means: \"There exists a tove (t) and there exists a rath (r) such that t -> r.\"\n    From the given information, we know \"A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\" Let this tove be T_0.\n    Since there is at least one rath (R is not empty), T_0 must have snicker-snacked at least one rath.\n    Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**6. No toves snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    This statement means: \"For every tove (t), and for every rath (r), it is NOT the case that t -> r.\" (i.e., no tove snicker-snacked any rath).\n    This directly contradicts the fact that \"A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\" If a tove snicker-snacked *every* rath, it certainly snicker-snacked *a* rath.\n    Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

No borogoves gyred.**\n*   We are given: \"Every borogove gyred.\"\n*   This statement contradicts the given information.\n*   Therefore, \"No borogoves gyred\" must be **false**.\n\n**3. A borogove gyred.**\n*   We are given: \"Every borogove gyred.\"\n*   Since there is at least one borogove (from \"there's at least one of each\"), and every single one of them gyred, it logically follows that at least one borogove gyred.\n*   Therefore, \"A borogove gyred\" must be **true**.\n\n**4. Rafin will whiffle.**\n*   We know Rafin is not a tove.\n*   Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath (since everything is exclusively one of the three).\n*   We are told \"A borogove will whiffle.\" This means *some* borogove will whiffle, but not necessarily *all* borogoves will whiffle.\n*   If Rafin is a borogove, Rafin *might* whiffle, but we don't know for sure if Rafin is *the* borogove that will whiffle.\n*   If Rafin is a rath, then Rafin won't whiffle based on the information given about borogoves.\n*   We don't have enough information to definitively say whether Rafin will whiffle.\n*   Therefore, \"Rafin will whiffle\" is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**5. Only borogoves gyred.**\n*   We know \"Every borogove gyred.\"\n*   This statement implies that *nothing else* (toves or raths) gyred.\n*   The given information does not provide any details about toves or raths gyring.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a tove (T), a borogove (B), or a rath (R).\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Galumphing:** A rath galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it. (This implies a cycle: R1 -> B1 -> R1. This is a specific instance of galumphing, not a general rule.)\n*   **Snicker-snacking Rule:** Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it. (This is a crucial rule about the snicker-snacking relationship among raths. Let's denote \"X snicker-snacked Y\" as S(X, Y). The rule is: For any raths X, Y, if S(Y, X), then S(X, Y). This means the snicker-snacking relationship among raths is symmetric.)\n*   **Individuals:** Rafin is a tove. Bungo is a rath.\n\n**Analyzing the Snicker-snacking Rule:**\n\nThe rule \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it\" means that if rath A snicker-snacked rath B, then rath B must also have snicker-snacked rath A. In other words, the snicker-snacking relationship among raths is **symmetric**.\n\nLet's denote the set of all raths as $R_{set}$.\nThe rule states: $\\forall x, y \\in R_{set}$, if $S(y, x)$, then $S(x, y)$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\nThis means $\\forall x, y \\in R_{set}$, $S(x, y)$.\nThe given rule only states symmetry. It doesn't say that every rath snicker-snacked every other rath, or even itself. For example, if there are two raths, Bungo and Zingo, the rule says if Bungo snicker-snacked Zingo, then Zingo snicker-snacked Bungo. It doesn't say Bungo *must* snicker-snack Zingo, or that Bungo *must* snicker-snack Bungo.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**2. A rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\nThis means $\\exists x, y \\in R_{set}$ such that $S(x, y)$.\nThe problem states there is at least one rath (Bungo is a rath). However, it doesn't state that any rath *actually* snicker-snacked another rath (or itself). The rule is conditional: *if* a rath snicker-snacked another, *then* the relationship is symmetric. It doesn't guarantee that any snicker-snacking occurred at all. It's possible that no raths snicker-snacked any raths.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**3. A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\nThis means $\\exists x \\in R_{set}$ such that $\\forall y \\in R_{set}$, $S(x, y)$.\nSimilar to statement 1, the rule only implies symmetry if snicker-snacking occurs. It doesn't guarantee that any specific rath snicker-snacked all other raths (or even itself).\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**4. A rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.**\nThis means $\\exists x \\in R_{set}$ such that $\\forall y \\in R_{set}$, if $S(y, x)$, then $S(x, y)$.\nThis statement is a direct consequence of the given rule, \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\" The given rule applies to *every* rath. Therefore, it must apply to *a* rath (i.e., at least one rath). If the rule holds for all raths, it must hold for at least one rath.\n*   **Must be true? Yes.**\n\n**5. No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\nThis means $\\neg (\\exists x \\in R_{set} \\text{ such that } \\forall y \\in R_{set}, S(x, y))$.\nThis is the negation of statement 3. Since statement 3 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either. It's possible that a rath *did* snicker-snack every rath (e.g., if there's only one rath, and it snicker-snacked itself, or if all raths snicker-snacked each other). The rule doesn't prevent this.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**6. Every rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\nThis means $\\forall x \\in R_{set}$, $\\exists y \\in R_{set}$ such that $S(x, y)$.\nThis implies that every rath snicker-snacked at least one rath (which could be itself). Similar to statement 2, the given rule is conditional. It doesn't guarantee that any snicker-snacking *occurred*. It's possible that no raths snicker-snacked any raths, in which case this statement would be false.\n*   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it\" rule. This is a universal conditional statement. It means:\nFor any rath X and any rath Y: IF Y snicker-snacked X, THEN X snicker-snacked Y.\n\nStatement 4 says: \"A rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\"\nThis means: There exists at least one rath X such that for any rath Y: IF Y snicker-snacked X, THEN X snicker-snacked Y.\n\nSince the original rule applies to *every* rath, it necessarily applies to *at least one* rath. If it's true for all, it's true for some. Therefore, statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(This is a crucial negative statement).\n*   A rath galumphed over Rafin or a rath galumphed over Zindle. (This tells us something about galumphing, but not necessarily about raths galumphing over raths).\n\n**Analyzing the Crucial Negative Statement:**\n\n\"No raths galumphed over a rath.\"\n\nThis statement directly implies that for any rath X and any rath Y, X did not galumph over Y. In other words, the \"galumphing\" relationship *never* occurs between two raths.\n\n**Evaluating Each Statement:**\n\nLet's use the notation G(X, Y) to mean \"X galumphed over Y\".\nLet R be the set of all raths.\n\n1.  **There is a rath that every rath galumphed over.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists y \\in R \\text{ such that } \\forall x \\in R, G(x, y)$.\n    *   However, we know \"No raths galumphed over a rath.\" This means for any $x \\in R$ and any $y \\in R$, $\\neg G(x, y)$.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n2.  **A rath galumphed over a rath.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists x \\in R, \\exists y \\in R \\text{ such that } G(x, y)$.\n    *   Again, we know \"No raths galumphed over a rath.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n3.  **Every rath galumphed over every rath.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, G(x, y)$.\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No raths galumphed over a rath.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n4.  **A rath galumphed over every rath.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists x \\in R \\text{ such that } \\forall y \\in R, G(x, y)$.\n    *   This also directly contradicts \"No raths galumphed over a rath.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n5.  **A rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists x \\in R \\text{ such that } \\forall y \\in R \\text{ (if } G(y, x) \\text{ then } G(x, y))$.\n    *   Let's analyze the condition \"if G(y, x)\". Since y is a rath and x is a rath, we know from \"No raths galumphed over a rath\" that G(y, x) is always false.\n    *   Therefore, the premise of the implication \"if G(y, x)\" is always false.\n    *   In logic, \"False implies anything\" is always true. So, \"if G(y, x) then G(x, y)\" is always true for any raths x and y.\n    *   Since this implication is always true for any raths x and y, it is certainly true that there exists an x (any rath will do) such that for all y, the implication holds.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **true**.\n\n6.  **Every rath galumphed over a rath.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall x \\in R, \\exists y \\in R \\text{ such that } G(x, y)$.\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No raths galumphed over a rath.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 5. The key to solving this problem is the statement \"No raths galumphed over a rath,\" which makes any galumphing relationship between two raths impossible. This turns the conditional statement in option 5 into a vacuously true statement.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

So Rafin is either a Borogove or a Rath.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Rafin is a Rath.\n*   If Rafin is a Rath, then by Rule 2 (Every rath galumphed over Rafin), Rafin (being a rath) must have galumphed over Rafin (being a rath).\n*   However, Rule 1 states: \"No raths galumphed over a rath.\"\n*   This creates a contradiction: If Rafin is a Rath, then Rafin galumphed over Rafin (by Rule 2), but Rafin cannot galumph over Rafin (by Rule 1).\n*   Therefore, Rafin cannot be a Rath.\n\nSince Rafin isn't a Tove (Rule 3) and cannot be a Rath, Rafin must be a Borogove.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the options based on this deduction:**\n\n*   **1. Bungo isn't a tove.** (We don't have enough information about Bungo yet.)\n*   **2. Rafin is a tove.** (False, we deduced Rafin is a Borogove.)\n*   **3. A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.** (This is a self-contradictory statement, so it must be false.)\n*   **4. Rafin is a rath.** (False, we deduced Rafin is a Borogove.)\n*   **5. Bungo is a tove.** (We don't have enough information about Bungo yet.)\n*   **6. Rafin isn't a rath.** (True, we deduced Rafin is a Borogove, therefore not a rath.)\n\n**Conclusion so far:** Statement 6 must be true.\n\nLet's see if we can deduce anything about Bungo. The conditional statement (Rule 4) is the only one involving Bungo directly.\n\n*   P = \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n*   Q = \"A borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\"\n*   R = \"Bungo galumphed over Bungo.\"\n*   P $\\implies$ (Q $\\iff$ R)\n\nWe don't have any information that forces P to be true or false, or Q or R to be true or false. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine Bungo's category (Tove, Borogove, or Rath) or whether Bungo galumphed over Bungo, or whether a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\nFor example:\n*   If P is false (i.e., all toves chortled at Bungo), then the implication P $\\implies$ (Q $\\iff$ R) is true regardless of (Q $\\iff$ R). This tells us nothing about Bungo's category.\n*   If P is true, then (Q $\\iff$ R) must be true. This means Q and R are either both true or both false. But again, this doesn't definitively tell us Bungo's category.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine if Bungo is a tove or not a tove.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   **Rafin's Category:**\n    *   Rafin is not a Tove (given).\n    *   If Rafin were a Rath, then by \"Every rath galumphed over Rafin\", Rafin (as a rath) would galumph over Rafin (as a rath).\n    *   But \"No raths galumphed over a rath\" means a rath cannot galumph over a rath.\n    *   This is a contradiction. Therefore, Rafin cannot be a Rath.\n    *   Since Rafin must be a Tove, Borogove, or Rath, and is neither a Tove nor a Rath, Rafin must be a Borogove.\n\n*   **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   1. Bungo isn't a tove. (Cannot be determined)\n    *   2. Rafin is a tove. (False, Rafin is a Borogove)\n    *   3. A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.

It doesn't directly relate to toves or borogoves being uffish or chortling at Bungo.\n\n5.  **Toves Chortle:** \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   This means $\\neg (\\forall x \\in T, \\text{Chortle}(x, \\text{Bungo}))$.\n    *   Equivalently, $\\exists x \\in T \\text{ such that } \\neg \\text{Chortle}(x, \\text{Bungo})$.\n\n6.  **Rafin/Zindle:** \"it is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   This is a specific statement about Rafin and Zindle, unrelated to the properties of toves or borogoves or their chortling at Bungo.\n\n**Analyzing the Core Information for the Options:**\n\nFrom the given information, we have two key facts that are relevant to the options:\n\n*   **Fact A:** \"A borogove is uffish.\" ($\\exists x \\in B, U(x)$)\n*   **Fact B:** \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo.\" ($\\exists x \\in T, \\neg \\text{Chortle}(x, \\text{Bungo})$)\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: A borogove is uffish and not all toves chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This statement is a direct conjunction of Fact A and Fact B.\n*   Fact A: \"A borogove is uffish\" - This is explicitly stated in the problem.\n*   Fact B: \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" - This is explicitly stated in the problem.\n*   Since both parts are true based on the given information, their conjunction must be true.\n\n**Statement 2: A borogove is uffish and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n*   \"A borogove is uffish\" - True (Fact A).\n*   \"no toves chortled at Bungo\" - This means $\\forall x \\in T, \\neg \\text{Chortle}(x, \\text{Bungo})$.\n*   The given information states \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" (Fact B), which means *at least one* tove didn't chortle. It does *not* mean *no* toves chortled. Some toves might have chortled at Bungo, as long as not *all* of them did.\n*   Therefore, \"no toves chortled at Bungo\" is not necessarily true. It could be false.\n*   Since one part of the conjunction is not necessarily true, the entire statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: Not all toves chortled at Bungo and every borogove is uffish.**\n*   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" - True (Fact B).\n*   \"every borogove is uffish\" - This means $\\forall x \\in B, U(x)$.\n*   The given information states \"A borogove is uffish\" (Fact A), which means $\\exists x \\in B, U(x)$. This only guarantees *at least one* borogove is uffish, not *every* borogove. There could be other borogoves that are not uffish.\n*   Therefore, \"every borogove is uffish\" is not necessarily true.\n*   Since one part of the conjunction is not necessarily true, the entire statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Every tove is uffish unless every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This is of the form \"P unless Q\", which is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then P\" or \"P or Q\".\n*   So, this statement means: \"Every tove is uffish OR every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n*   \"Every tove is uffish\" ($\\forall x \\in T, U(x)$) - We have no information about whether toves are uffish. This is not necessarily true.\n*   \"every borogove chortled at Bungo\" ($\\forall x \\in B, \\text{Chortle}(x, \\text{Bungo})$) - We have no information about borogoves chortling at Bungo. This is not necessarily true.\n*   Since neither disjunct is necessarily true, the disjunction is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: Every tove is uffish or every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This is the same logical form as Statement 4.\n*   As explained for Statement 4, neither part is necessarily true, so the disjunction is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: Every borogove is uffish and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n*   \"Every borogove is uffish\" - Not necessarily true (as explained for Statement 3).\n*   \"no toves chortled at Bungo\" - Not necessarily true (as explained for Statement 2).\n*   Since both parts are not necessarily true, their conjunction is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Statement 1 is directly and entirely supported by the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

And if you pick any tove, *all* borogoves snicker-snacked it.\n\n2.  **\"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all toves chortled at Rafin.\"**\n    *   Let $P$ be \"All borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" ($\\forall b \\in B, SS(b, \\text{Rafin})$).\n    *   Let $Q$ be \"All toves chortled at Rafin\" ($\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Rafin})$).\n    *   The statement is: $\\neg P \\implies \\neg Q$.\n    *   This is logically equivalent to $Q \\implies P$.\n    *   So, \"If all toves chortled at Rafin, then all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n\n3.  **\"Not all toves gyred just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\"**\n    *   Let $R$ be \"All toves gyred\" ($\\forall t \\in T, G(t)$).\n    *   Let $S$ be \"Some tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" ($\\exists t \\in T, SS(t, \\text{Zindle})$).\n    *   \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is $\\neg S$.\n    *   \"Not all toves gyred\" is $\\neg R$.\n    *   \"Just in case\" means biconditional ($\\iff$).\n    *   So, $\\neg R \\iff \\neg S$.\n    *   This is logically equivalent to $R \\iff S$.\n    *   So, \"All toves gyred if and only if some tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\nLet's use the first premise heavily: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked every tove.\" ($\\forall b \\in B, \\forall t \\in T, SS(b, t)$)\n\n*   Since there's at least one borogove ($b_0$) and at least one tove ($t_0$), we know $SS(b_0, t_0)$.\n*   More generally, for any specific tove $t_x$, *every* borogove snicker-snacked $t_x$.\n*   And for any specific borogove $b_x$, it snicker-snacked *every* tove.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.**\n    *   From premise 1: $\\forall b \\in B, \\forall t \\in T, SS(b, t)$.\n    *   This means for *any* tove $t_x$, it is true that every borogove snicker-snacked $t_x$.\n    *   Since there is at least one tove, let's call it $t_0$. Then it is true that every borogove snicker-snacked $t_0$.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**2. A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   Premise 1 states: $\\forall b \\in B, \\forall t \\in T, SS(b, t)$. This means borogoves snicker-snacked toves.\n    *   This statement is about toves snicker-snacking borogoves ($SS(t, b)$).\n    *   The premises give no information about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. The relationship is not necessarily symmetric.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**3. No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   This means $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, SS(t, b))$.\n    *   This is equivalent to $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, \\neg SS(t, b)$.\n    *   Again, the premises give no information about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. It's possible that some tove *did* snicker-snack every borogove, or that no tove did. We can't determine this from the given information.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**4. A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   This means $\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, SS(t, b)$.\n    *   Similar to statement 2 and 3, this is about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**5. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   This means $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, SS(t, b)$.\n    *   Again, this is about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. The premises only state the opposite direction (borogoves snicker-snacked toves).\n    *   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**6. Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   This means $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, SS(t, b)$.\n    *   Similar to the previous statements, this is about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 1 can be logically deduced from the given premises. The other premises (about Rafin and Zindle) are not relevant to the relationships between toves and borogoves in general, only to specific individuals or properties. The first premise alone is sufficient to prove statement 1.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

(\u00acTB, \u00acBB)\n\n*   **From P5 (Not all toves galumphed over Zindle):** This means there is at least one tove, let's call it T1, such that T1 did not galumph over Zindle (T1 \u2227 \u00acG(T1)Z).\n\n*   **Consider P4 (If Rafin is a tove, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every rath galumphed over Rafin):**\n    *   We know Bungo is a rath (P6). So, Bungo cannot galumph over Zindle if Zindle is also a rath (as a rath cannot galumph over itself or another rath, based on the structure of the problem, though this isn't explicitly stated as a rule, it's usually implied that actions are between different types or within a type, not necessarily self-referential for categories). However, the statement is about Bungo (a rath) galumphing over Zindle (whose type is unknown yet).\n    *   Let's analyze the consequent: \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\"\n        *   This means: If Bungo galumphed over Zindle, then every rath galumphed over Rafin. (BGZ \u2192 \u2200x (Rx \u2192 GxR))\n    *   Since Bungo is a rath (P6), and we know there's at least one rath (Bungo), the condition \"every rath galumphed over Rafin\" includes Bungo galumphing over Rafin.\n\n*   **Revisit P1 (Every tove galumphed over a tove):** This statement is a fundamental property of toves. It means that for any tove X, there exists at least one tove Y such that X galumphed over Y.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on our premises and deductions.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n1.  **A tove galumphed over every tove.** (\u2203x (Tx \u2227 \u2200y (Ty \u2192 Gxy)))\n    *   This means there's *one specific tove* that galumphed over *all* other toves (and itself, if it's a tove).\n    *   P1 states \"Every tove galumphed over *a* tove\" (meaning for each tove, it galumphed over *at least one* tove). This is weaker than option 1. P1 doesn't guarantee a single \"master\" tove.\n    *   We cannot deduce this from the given information.\n\n2.  **No toves galumphed over a tove.** (\u00ac\u2203x (Tx \u2227 \u2203y (Ty \u2227 Gxy)))\n    *   This is equivalent to: For every tove X, X did not galumph over any tove Y. (\u2200x (Tx \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Ty \u2227 Gxy)))\n    *   This directly contradicts P1: \"Every tove galumphed over a tove.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n3.  **No toves galumphed over every tove.** (\u00ac\u2203x (Tx \u2227 \u2200y (Ty \u2192 Gxy)))\n    *   This is the negation of option 1.\n    *   We couldn't prove option 1, but can we prove its negation? Not necessarily. The premises don't give us enough information to determine if such a \"master\" tove exists or not.\n\n4.  **Every tove galumphed over every tove.** (\u2200x (Tx \u2192 \u2200y (Ty \u2192 Gxy)))\n    *   This means for any two toves X and Y (possibly X=Y), X galumphed over Y.\n    *   P1 states \"Every tove galumphed over *a* tove.\" This is much weaker. P1 only guarantees that each tove galumphed over *at least one* tove, not necessarily *all* toves.\n    *   We cannot deduce this from the given information.\n\n5.  **There is a tove that every tove galumphed over.** (\u2203y (Ty \u2227 \u2200x (Tx \u2192 Gxy)))\n    *   This means there's *one specific tove* (the \"target\" tove) that *all* other toves galumphed over.\n    *   This is different from option 1. Option 1 is about a \"master\" tove doing the galumphing. Option 5 is about a \"universal target\" tove.\n    *   We cannot deduce this from the given information.\n\n6.  **A tove galumphed over a tove.** (\u2203x (Tx \u2227 \u2203y (Ty \u2227 Gxy)))\n    *   This means there exists at least one tove X and at least one tove Y such that X galumphed over Y.\n    *   Let's look at P1: \"Every tove galumphed over a tove.\"\n        *   Since we know there's at least one tove (because \"there's at least one of each\" category), let's call it T_alpha.\n        *   According to P1, T_alpha galumphed over *a* tove (let's call it T_beta).\n        *   Therefore, T_alpha galumphed over T_beta, which means \"A tove galumphed over a tove\" is true.\n    *   This statement is a direct consequence of P1 and the existence of at least one tove.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 6 is directly supported by the premises. P1 states \"Every tove galumphed over a tove.\" Since we are told there is at least one tove, this implies that *some* tove exists that galumphed over *some* other tove (which could be itself). This directly matches the meaning of \"A tove galumphed over a tove.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

There's at least one of each.\n2.  **Rafin & Bungo:** Rafin snicker-snacked Bungo.\n3.  **Rath & Zindle:** A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n4.  **Borogove & Zindle:** Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n5.  **Conditional (Rafin & Whiffle):** If Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin, then (every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if not all toves will whiffle).\n6.  **Borogove & Whiffle:** Not all borogoves will whiffle.\n7.  **Bungo & Mimsy:** Bungo isn't mimsy.\n\n**Analysis of Key Information:**\n\n*   From point 4: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This is a very strong statement. It means that for any individual that is a borogove, it snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's look at the provided statements and see if they must be true based on the given information.\n\n*   **Statement 1: Zindle will whiffle.**\n    *   We have no information linking Zindle to whiffle. The only whiffle information is about toves and borogoves. This statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n*   **Statement 2: No borogoves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    *   This directly contradicts point 4: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **Statement 3: A borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    *   Point 4 states: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" If *every* borogove snicker-snacked Zindle, then it logically follows that *at least one* (or \"a\") borogove snicker-snacked Zindle. This statement must be true.\n\n*   **Statement 4: Zindle snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   Point 4 tells us that borogoves snicker-snacked Zindle, not the other way around. We have no information about Zindle snicker-snacking anyone. This statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n*   **Statement 5: Zindle snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   Similar to statement 4, this reverses the action described in point 4. We have no information to support this. This statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n*   **Statement 6: Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    *   This directly contradicts point 4: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" If *every* borogove snicker-snacked Zindle, then it's false that \"not all\" of them did. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information provided, specifically point 4 (\"Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle\"), only statement 3 is necessarily true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

Zindle gimbled.** We have no information about Zindle gimbled.\n*   **2. No borogoves gimbled.** This is exactly what we deduced: $\\forall x (B(x) \\implies \\neg G(x))$. This must be true.\n*   **3. A borogove gimbled.** This is the negation of what we deduced. So, this must be false.\n*   **4. Only borogoves gimbled.** This means $\\forall x (G(x) \\implies B(x))$. Since no borogoves gimbled, this would imply $\\forall x (G(x) \\implies \\text{False})$, which means no one gimbled. We don't know if no one gimbled. For example, a tove or a rath could have gimbled. So, this is not necessarily true.\n*   **5. Zindle and Rafin gimbled.** We have no information about Zindle or Rafin gimbled.\n*   **6. Every borogove gimbled.** This is the negation of what we deduced. So, this must be false.\n\nLet's see if we can deduce anything else to confirm or deny other options, although we already found a definite answer.\n\nFrom P6a: $\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\neg S(x, \\text{Zindle}))$\nThis means \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true.\nThe negation of \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is \"Some toves snicker-snacked Zindle\".\nThe negation of \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is \"All toves snicker-snacked Zindle\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate Premise 5:\n*   Premise 5: $\\neg (\\exists x (T(x) \\land S(x, \\text{Zindle}))) \\iff \\neg (\\forall x (B(x) \\implies C(x, \\text{Bungo})))$\n*   The left side is \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" ($\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg S(x, \\text{Zindle}))$).\n*   From P6a, we know $\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\neg S(x, \\text{Zindle}))$, which means \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\".\n*   This means \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is **false**. (Because if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then it would be true that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, but it would also mean that *all* toves did *not* snicker-snack Zindle. P6a only says *not all* snicker-snacked, implying some might have, or none did. But the phrasing \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg S(x, \\text{Zindle}))$. If this were true, then P6a would be true. So, P6a being true doesn't directly tell us if \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true or false. Let's be careful.)\n\nLet's re-read P6a: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\". This means $\\neg (\\forall x (T(x) \\implies S(x, \\text{Zindle})))$.\nThis is equivalent to $\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\neg S(x, \\text{Zindle}))$. This is true.\n\nNow, let's look at the left side of Premise 5: \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\". This is $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg S(x, \\text{Zindle}))$.\nIs this true or false?\nIf $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg S(x, \\text{Zindle}))$ is true, then $\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\neg S(x, \\text{Zindle}))$ is also true.\nSo, P6a being true does not mean \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is false. It could be true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Premise 6: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\". This is $\\neg (\\forall x (T(x) \\implies S(x, \\text{Zindle})))$.\nLet's call this proposition $P_A$. So $P_A$ is true.\n\nPremise 4: $\\neg (\\exists x (B(x) \\land G(x))) \\iff P_A$.\nSince $P_A$ is true, then $\\neg (\\exists x (B(x) \\land G(x)))$ must be true.\nThis means \"No borogoves gimbled\" is true. This confirms our earlier deduction.\n\nPremise 5: $\\neg (\\exists x (T(x) \\land S(x, \\text{Zindle}))) \\iff \\neg (\\forall x (B(x) \\implies C(x, \\text{Bungo})))$.\nLet's call the left side $P_B$: \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\".\nLet's call the right side $P_C$: \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\nSo, $P_B \\iff P_C$.\n\nWe know $P_A$ is true: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\".\nThis means it's not the case that all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\nThis does not directly tell us if $P_B$ (\"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\") is true or false.\nIf $P_B$ is true, then $P_A$ is true.\nIf $P_B$ is false, then $\\exists x (T(x) \\land S(x, \\text{Zindle}))$ is true. In this case, $P_A$ could still be true (e.g., some toves snicker-snacked Zindle, and some did not).\n\nLet's consider the implications of \"No borogoves gimbled\" being true.\nThis means option 2 is true.\n\nLet's re-check the other options.\n1.

This doesn't directly tell us about Rafin's gyring status.\n\n    *   Let's consider the implications of $\\neg T(r)$ on statement (4).\n        *   Statement (4): (If something gyred, it's a tove) OR (Every tove galumphed over Rafin).\n        *   If Rafin gyred ($Y(r)$), then for the first part of (4) to be true, $T(r)$ would have to be true. But we know $\\neg T(r)$.\n        *   Therefore, if $Y(r)$ is true, then the first part of (4) must be false.\n        *   If the first part of (4) is false, then the second part of (4) *must* be true for (4) to hold.\n        *   So, if $Y(r)$, then $\\forall t (T(t) \\implies G(t, r))$ must be true. This is consistent.\n\n    *   This means we cannot definitively say whether Rafin gyred or not from (4) and $\\neg T(r)$ alone.\n\n*   **From (5):**\n    *   $(\\neg \\exists t (T(t) \\land S(t, z))) \\implies (\\neg S(r, r))$\n    *   This is equivalent to its contrapositive: $S(r, r) \\implies \\exists t (T(t) \\land S(t, z))$\n    *   If Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, then some tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n**Re-evaluating the options based on Deduction 1 ($\\neg T(r)$):**\n\n*   **1.

Rafin gyred.** ($Y(r)$) - We deduced that if $Y(r)$, then $\\forall t (T(t) \\implies G(t, r))$ must be true. But we don't know if $Y(r)$ is true.\n*   **6. Zindle and Rafin gyred.** ($Y(z) \\land Y(r)$) - No information to confirm this.\n\nLet's double check the reasoning for $\\neg T(r)$.\n\n1.  \"No toves galumphed over every borogove.\"\n    $\\forall t (T(t) \\implies \\exists b (B(b) \\land \\neg G(t, b)))$\n    (Every tove failed to galumph over at least one borogove.)\n\n2.  \"Rafin galumphed over every borogove.\"\n    $\\forall b (B(b) \\implies G(r, b))$\n\nAssume Rafin is a tove ($T(r)$).\nFrom (1), if $T(r)$, then $\\exists b (B(b) \\land \\neg G(r, b))$. This means there is at least one borogove that Rafin did *not* galumph over.\nFrom (2), $\\forall b (B(b) \\implies G(r, b))$. This means Rafin *did* galumph over *every* borogove.\n\nThese two statements are contradictory. Therefore, our assumption that Rafin is a tove must be false.\nThus, Rafin isn't a tove. This deduction is solid.\n\nSince statement 2 (\"Rafin isn't a tove\") must be true, and statement 3 (\"Rafin is a tove\") must be false, we have found a definitive answer.\n\nLet's consider if any other statements *must* be true.\n\nWe know $\\neg T(r)$.\nFrom (4): $(\\forall x (Y(x) \\implies T(x))) \\lor (\\forall t (T(t) \\implies G(t, r)))$\n\nCase 1: Assume the first part of",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) (exclusively). There's at least one of each.\n    *   This means T, B, R are disjoint sets, and their union is everything.\n    *   $T \\cap B = \\emptyset$, $T \\cap R = \\emptyset$, $B \\cap R = \\emptyset$\n    *   $T \\cup B \\cup R = \\text{Universe}$\n    *   $|T| \\ge 1$, $|B| \\ge 1$, $|R| \\ge 1$\n\n2.  **Toves and Rafin:** \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\"\n    *   Let $C(x, y)$ mean \"x chortled at y\".\n    *   This translates to: $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n    *   Equivalently, there is no tove $t$ such that $C(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n\n3.  **Toves and Bungo:** \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\": $\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Bungo}))$. This means $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo\": $\\neg C(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo})$.\n\n4.  **Conditional Statement:** \"If not all borogoves are mimsy, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   Let $M(x)$ mean \"x is mimsy\".\n    *   Let $G(x, y)$ mean \"x galumphed over y\".\n    *   The antecedent is: $\\neg (\\forall b \\in B, M(b))$. This means $\\exists b \\in B, \\neg M(b)$.\n    *   The consequent is: $(\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, G(t, \\text{Zindle}))) \\implies C(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Zindle})$.\n    *   So, the full statement is: $(\\exists b \\in B, \\neg M(b)) \\implies ((\\exists t \\in T, \\neg G(t, \\text{Zindle})) \\implies C(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Zindle}))$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to be Evaluated:**\n\nWe need to determine which of the following *must* be true based *only* on the given information.\n\nLet's focus on the statements related to \"toves\" and \"Rafin\", as the second piece of given information directly addresses this.\n\n**Given Information 2:** \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\"\nThis means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n1.  **\"Not all toves chortled at Rafin.\"**\n    *   This statement means: $\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Rafin}))$.\n    *   This is equivalent to: $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n    *   From Given Information 2, we know $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n    *   If *no* toves chortled at Rafin, then it is certainly true that *not all* toves chortled at Rafin (because if all of them did, it would contradict \"no toves chortled at Rafin\").\n    *   This statement *must* be true.\n\n2.  **\"A tove chortled at Rafin.\"**\n    *   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n    *   This directly contradicts Given Information 2 (\"No toves chortled at Rafin\").\n    *   This statement *must be false*.\n\n3.  **\"Rafin chortled at every tove.\"**\n    *   This means: $\\forall t \\in T, C(\\text{Rafin}, t)$.\n    *   The given information states \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" ($\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Rafin})$). This tells us nothing about whether Rafin chortled at toves.\n    *   We don't know if Rafin is a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true or false based on the given information. It *could* be true, or it *could* be false.\n\n4.  **\"No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.\"**\n    *   \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" is true (from Given Information 2).\n    *   We need to determine if \"Rafin isn't a tove\" must be true.\n    *   The problem states \"Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively)\". So Rafin must be one of these.\n    *   If Rafin *were* a tove, say $t_R \\in T$, then the statement \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" would mean $\\neg C(t_R, t_R)$. This is perfectly consistent.\n    *   The given information does not tell us whether Rafin is a tove or not.\n    *   Therefore, the second part of the conjunction (\"Rafin isn't a tove\") is not necessarily true.\n    *   Since one part of the conjunction is not necessarily true, the entire conjunction is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **\"Every tove chortled at Rafin.\"**\n    *   This means: $\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n    *   This directly contradicts Given Information 2 (\"No toves chortled at Rafin\").\n    *   This statement *must be false*.\n\n6.  **\"Rafin chortled at a tove.\"**\n    *   This means: $\\exists t \\in T, C(\\text{Rafin}, t)$.\n    *   Similar to statement 3, the given information \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" ($\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Rafin})$) tells us nothing about whether Rafin chortled at toves.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true or false based on the given information. It *could* be true, or it *could* be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct implication of \"No toves chortled at Rafin\", only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Borogove Action:** A borogove snicker-snacked Zindle. (This tells us Zindle exists and is not a borogove, tove, or rath, as the action is performed *on* Zindle, not *by* Zindle as one of the categories. Or, Zindle could be one of the categories, and a *different* borogove snicker-snacked Zindle. Let's assume Zindle is an entity that can be acted upon.)\n4.  **Bungo's Chortling:** Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo. (Self-referential, but doesn't directly help with categories or mimsiness yet).\n5.  **Rafin's Chortling:** It is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle. (This means Rafin did *not* chortle at Zindle).\n6.  **Beamish Property 1:** Only borogoves are beamish. This means:\n    *   If something is beamish, then it is a borogove.\n    *   If something is *not* a borogove, then it is *not* beamish.\n7.  **Bungo's Mimsiness:** Bungo isn't mimsy. (Bungo is not M).\n8.  **Beamish Property 2 (Redundant):** Only borogoves are beamish. (Same as 6).\n9.  **Bungo's Category:** Bungo is a rath. (Bungo is R).\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n*   From (7) and (9): Bungo is a rath, and Bungo isn't mimsy.\n    *   This directly tells us: There exists a rath (Bungo) that is *not* mimsy.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements based on this deduction:\n\n1.  **A rath is mimsy.**\n    *   We know Bungo is a rath and Bungo is *not* mimsy. This statement claims *a* rath *is* mimsy. Our information doesn't confirm or deny this. We only know one rath (Bungo) is not mimsy. There could be other raths that are mimsy. So, this is **Unknown**.\n\n2.  **Every rath is mimsy.**\n    *   We know Bungo is a rath and Bungo is *not* mimsy. This directly contradicts \"Every rath is mimsy.\" So, this statement is **False**.\n\n3.  **Zindle is mimsy.**\n    *   We have no information about Zindle's mimsiness. So, this is **Unknown**.\n\n4.  **No raths are mimsy.**\n    *   We know Bungo is a rath and Bungo is *not* mimsy. This is consistent with \"No raths are mimsy.\" However, we don't have information about *all* raths. Could there be a rath that *is* mimsy? The information doesn't preclude it. For example, if there's another rath, Rath-X, we don't know if Rath-X is mimsy or not. So, this is **Unknown**.\n\n5.  **Only raths are mimsy.**\n    *   This means: If something is mimsy, then it is a rath.\n    *   We know Bungo is a rath and Bungo is *not* mimsy. This doesn't directly confirm or deny this statement. We have no information about anything *being* mimsy. So, this is **Unknown**.\n\n6.  **Not all raths are mimsy.**\n    *   We know Bungo is a rath and Bungo is *not* mimsy. This means that it is *not* the case that \"all raths are mimsy.\" In other words, there is at least one rath (Bungo) that is not mimsy. This statement is directly supported by our deduction. So, this statement is **True**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. Not all raths are mimsy.**",

(T $\\cup$ B $\\cup$ R = Universe, and T $\\cap$ B = $\\emptyset$, T $\\cap$ R = $\\emptyset$, B $\\cap$ R = $\\emptyset$)\n2.  **At least one of each:** |T| $\\ge$ 1, |B| $\\ge$ 1, |R| $\\ge$ 1\n3.  **Borogove galumphed over every tove:** $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B$ such that G(b, t). (This implies that for every tove, there's at least one borogove that galumphed over it. It doesn't mean *every* borogove galumphed over *every* tove, but rather that for each tove, some borogove did the galumphing.)\n    *   *Correction/Clarification:* The phrasing \"A borogove galumphed over every tove\" is ambiguous. It could mean:\n        *   (A) $\\exists b \\in B$ such that $\\forall t \\in T, G(b, t)$ (There exists one specific borogove that galumphed over all toves).\n        *   (B) $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B$ such that G(b, t) (For every tove, there's at least one borogove that galumphed over it).\n        Given the typical structure of these puzzles, (A) is more likely intended for \"A borogove galumphed over every tove.\" Let's assume (A) for now, as it's a stronger statement and often used in such puzzles. If it leads to a contradiction or no solution, we can revisit.\n        Let's re-read carefully: \"A borogove galumphed over every tove.\" This strongly suggests there exists *some* borogove that performed this action on *all* toves. So, $\\exists b_0 \\in B$ such that $\\forall t \\in T, G(b_0, t)$.\n4.  **Bungo chortled at every borogove:** $\\forall b \\in B, C(\\text{Bungo}, b)$.\n5.  **Conditional Statement:** $\\neg G(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Bungo}) \\implies (\\forall r \\in R, C(r, \\text{Bungo}) \\iff \\forall b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo}))$.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom statement 4: **Bungo chortled at every borogove.**\nThis means: $\\forall b \\in B, C(\\text{Bungo}, b)$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this strong deduction.\n\n**Option 1: Bungo isn't a borogove if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\nLet $P$ be \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" ($\\text{Bungo} \\notin B$).\nLet $Q$ be \"a borogove chortled at Bungo\" ($\\exists b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo})$).\nThe statement is $P \\iff Q$.\n\nWe know Bungo chortled at every borogove. This tells us nothing about whether a borogove chortled at Bungo, or what Bungo's type is.\nConsider two cases for Bungo:\n*   **Case A: Bungo is a borogove.** (Bungo $\\in B$)\n    *   Then $P$ is false.\n    *   Does $Q$ have to be true? If Bungo is a borogove, then $C(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo})$ means Bungo chortled at itself. This is a borogove chortling at Bungo. So $Q$ is true.\n    *   In this case, $P \\iff Q$ becomes False $\\iff$ True, which is False.\n*   **Case B: Bungo is not a borogove.** (Bungo $\\notin B$)\n    *   Then $P$ is true.\n    *   Does $Q$ have to be true? We don't know if any borogove chortled at Bungo.\n    *   If $Q$ is true, then True $\\iff$ True is True.\n    *   If $Q$ is false, then True $\\iff$ False is False.\nSince we can't determine if $Q$ is true or false when Bungo is not a borogove, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 2: Bungo chortled at a borogove.**\nFrom statement 4: \"Bungo chortled at every borogove.\"\nIf Bungo chortled at *every* borogove, then it certainly chortled at *a* borogove (since there's at least one borogove, |B| $\\ge$ 1).\nSo, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Option 3: A borogove chortled at Bungo.**\nThis is $\\exists b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo})$.\nWe know Bungo chortled at every borogove ($C(\\text{Bungo}, b)$ for all $b \\in B$). This does not imply that any borogove chortled at Bungo. The chortling relationship is not necessarily symmetric.\nFor example, Bungo could be a tove, and it chortled at all borogoves, but no borogove chortled at Bungo.\nSo, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 4: Every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\nThis is $\\forall b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo})$.\nAgain, we know Bungo chortled at every borogove. This is $C(\\text{Bungo}, b)$ for all $b \\in B$. This is the reverse direction.\nThis statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 5: Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\nThis is $\\neg (\\forall b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo}))$, which is equivalent to $\\exists b \\in B, \\neg C(b, \\text{Bungo})$.\nThis is the negation of Option 4. Since Option 4 is not necessarily true, its negation is also not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 6: No borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\nThis is $\\forall b \\in B, \\neg C(b, \\text{Bungo})$.\nThis is a stronger version of \"A borogove didn't chortle at Bungo.\"\nThis is not necessarily true.\n\n**Revisiting the Conditional Statement (Statement 5):**\n$\\neg G(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Bungo}) \\implies (\\forall r \\in R, C(r, \\text{Bungo}) \\iff \\forall b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo}))$\n\nLet $P_1 = \\neg G(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Bungo})$\nLet $Q_1 = \\forall r \\in R, C(r, \\text{Bungo})$\nLet $Q_2 = \\forall b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo})$\nThe statement is $P_1 \\implies (Q_1 \\iff Q_2)$.\n\nDoes this conditional statement help us determine any of the options?\nThe antecedent $P_1$ might be true or false.\nIf $P_1$ is false (i.e., Zindle *did* galumph over Bungo), then the entire conditional statement is true regardless of the consequent, and tells us nothing.\nIf $P_1$ is true (i.e., Zindle *didn't* galumph over Bungo), then $Q_1 \\iff Q_2$ must be true. This means that either both \"Every rath chortled at Bungo\" and \"Every borogove chortled at Bungo\" are true, or both are false.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly relate to Zindle or raths, except for the possibility of \"Every borogove chortled at Bungo\" (Option 4) being linked to \"Every rath chortled at Bungo.\"\nWe already determined that Option 4 is not necessarily true. The conditional statement doesn't force it to be true. It only states that if Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo, then Option 4's truth value is the same as \"Every rath chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is derived directly and solely from \"Bungo chortled at every borogove\" and the fact that there is at least one borogove.\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   \"Bungo chortled at every borogove.\" ($\\forall b \\in B, C(\\text{Bungo}, b)$)\n*   \"there's at least one of each [tove, borogove, rath].\" ($|B| \\ge 1$)\n\nIf Bungo chortled at *every* borogove, and there is at least one borogove, then it logically follows that Bungo chortled at *a* borogove.\n\nTherefore, Option 2 is the only statement that must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

If Zindle (B1) chortled at Zindle (B2), then B1 and B2 are the same entity. Rule (3) is about *distinct* borogoves or a borogove not chortling at itself if it chortled at itself.

We don't have enough information to definitively say Zindle isn't a tove. It could be a tove.\n\n3.  **Zindle isn't a borogove.**\n    *   **True.** This was directly deduced from the contradiction with rule (3) if Zindle were a borogove.\n\n4.  **Zindle is a tove.**\n    *   We know Zindle isn't a borogove.

We only know what borogoves do to Zindle.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 4 is **not necessarily true** (and likely false, as Zindle is an object in the given context).\n\n*   **Statement 5: Zindle snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   Similar to Statement 4, this reverses the roles. We have no information about Zindle performing actions.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 5 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **Statement 3: Zindle is uffish.**\n    *   Let's re-examine the rules for \"uffish.\"\n        *   Rule 3: \"it is not the case that Rafin is uffish.\" (Rafin is NOT uffish). This tells us about Rafin, not Zindle.\n        *   Rule 4: \"Every tove is uffish unless no borogoves are beamish.\" This tells us about toves, not Zindle.\n    *   There is no rule or combination of rules that states Zindle is uffish. Zindle is primarily an object of snicker-snacking.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 3 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct implications of Rule 3 (\"Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle\") and the existence of at least one borogove, only one statement must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

This means $T \\cup B \\cup R = U$ (the universe of all things), and $T \\cap B = \\emptyset$, $T \\cap R = \\emptyset$, $B \\cap R = \\emptyset$.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each. $|T| \\ge 1$, $|B| \\ge 1$, $|R| \\ge 1$.\n3.  **Rath-Tove Galumphing:** Every rath galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\n    *   For every $r \\in R$, there exists a $t \\in T$ such that $rGt$ and $tGr$.\n4.  **Rath Snicker-Snacking:** A rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked a rath.\n    *   There exist $r_1, r_2, r_3 \\in R$ such that $r_1 S r_2$ and $r_2 S r_3$.\n5.  **Conditional Statement (Bungo/Zindle):** If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n    *   Let $P$ be \"Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\" ($\\forall r \\in R, r S \\text{Bungo}$).\n    *   Let $Q$ be \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle\" ($\\text{Bungo} G \\text{Zindle}$).\n    *   Let $R'$ be \"No raths galumphed over Bungo\" ($\\neg \\exists r \\in R, r G \\text{Bungo}$).\n    *   The statement is: $P \\implies (Q \\implies R')$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements to be Checked:**\n\nWe need to determine which of the following *must be true*:\n\n1.  **No toves galumphed over a rath.** ($\\neg \\exists t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, tGr$)\n2.  **A tove galumphed over a rath.** ($\\exists t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, tGr$)\n3.  **No toves galumphed over every rath.** ($\\neg \\exists t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, tGr$)\n4.  **A tove galumphed over every rath.** ($\\exists t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, tGr$)\n5.  **Every tove galumphed over every rath.** ($\\forall t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, tGr$)\n6.  **Every tove galumphed over a rath.** ($\\forall t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, tGr$)\n\n**Focusing on Axiom 3:**\n\n\"Every rath galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\"\nThis is the most relevant axiom for the \"galumphed over\" relation between raths and toves.\n\nLet $r$ be an arbitrary rath ($r \\in R$).\nAccording to Axiom 3, there exists a tove $t$ ($t \\in T$) such that:\n*   $rGt$ (the rath galumphed over the tove)\n*   AND $tGr$ (the tove galumphed over the rath)\n\nSince this holds for *every* rath, and we know there's at least one rath ($|R| \\ge 1$), we can pick any rath, say $r_0$.\nFor $r_0$, there must exist some tove $t_0$ such that $t_0 G r_0$.\n\nThis directly implies that there exists at least one tove that galumphed over at least one rath.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements based on this deduction:**\n\n*   **Statement 1: No toves galumphed over a rath.** ($\\neg \\exists t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, tGr$)\n    *   Our deduction ($t_0 G r_0$) directly contradicts this. So, Statement 1 is **false**.\n\n*   **Statement 2: A tove galumphed over a rath.** ($\\exists t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, tGr$)\n    *   Our deduction ($t_0 G r_0$) directly confirms this. So, Statement 2 **must be true**.\n\nLet's quickly check if the other statements *must* be true or false.\n\n*   **Statement 3: No toves galumphed over every rath.** ($\\neg \\exists t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, tGr$)\n    *   This means it's not the case that there's a single tove that galumphed over all raths.\n    *   Could this be true? Yes. For example, if $R = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$ and $T = \\{t_1, t_2\\}$.\n        *   $r_1 G t_1$ and $t_1 G r_1$\n        *   $r_2 G t_2$ and $t_2 G r_2$\n        *   In this scenario, $t_1$ did not galumph over $r_2$, and $t_2$ did not galumph over $r_1$. So no single tove galumphed over *every* rath.\n    *   Could this be false (meaning \"A tove galumphed over every rath\" is true)? Yes. For example, if $R = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$ and $T = \\{t_1\\}$.\n        *   $r_1 G t_1$ and $t_1 G r_1$\n        *   $r_2 G t_1$ and $t_1 G r_2$\n        *   Here, $t_1$ galumphed over every rath.\n    *   Since Statement 3 is not always true, it does not *must be true*.\n\n*   **Statement 4: A tove galumphed over every rath.** ($\\exists t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, tGr$)\n    *   As shown above, this is not necessarily true. It depends on the specific configuration of galumphing.\n\n*   **Statement 5: Every tove galumphed over every rath.** ($\\forall t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, tGr$)\n    *   This is a very strong statement. It's highly unlikely to be true given only Axiom 3.\n    *   Consider $T = \\{t_1, t_2\\}$ and $R = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.\n        *   Axiom 3: $r_1 G t_x$ and $t_x G r_1$; $r_2 G t_y$ and $t_y G r_2$.\n        *   If $t_1 G r_1$ and $t_2 G r_2$, but $t_1$ does not galumph over $r_2$, then this statement is false.\n    *   This does not *must be true*.\n\n*   **Statement 6: Every tove galumphed over a rath.** ($\\forall t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, tGr$)\n    *   This means for every tove, there's at least one rath it galumphed over.\n    *   Consider $T = \\{t_1, t_2\\}$ and $R = \\{r_1\\}$.\n        *   Axiom 3: $r_1 G t_1$ and $t_1 G r_1$. (This satisfies the axiom for $r_1$).\n        *   In this scenario, $t_2$ does not galumph over any rath (since $r_1$ is the only rath, and $t_2$ doesn't galumph over it).\n    *   So, this statement does not *must be true*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must be true* is Statement 2, directly derived from Axiom 3. The other axioms (Rath Snicker-Snacking and the Bungo/Zindle conditional) do not provide information about the \"galumphed over\" relation between toves and raths that would change this conclusion or make any other statement necessarily true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Every borogove will burble.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No borogoves will burble.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **2. Zindle will burble.**\n    *   The information given tells us about toves snicker-snacking Zindle, and borogoves not bubbling. It says nothing about Zindle's ability or tendency to burble. Zindle is an entity, not a type of creature.\n    *   Therefore, we **cannot determine** if this is true or false.\n\n*   **3. A borogove will burble.**\n    *   This means \"There exists at least one borogove that will burble.\"\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No borogoves will burble.\" If no borogoves will burble, then it's impossible for *a* borogove to burble.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **4. Only borogoves will burble.**\n    *   This means \"If something burbles, then it is a borogove.\" AND \"Borogoves will burble.\"\n    *   We know \"No borogoves will burble.\" This makes the second part of the statement (\"Borogoves will burble\") false.\n    *   If no borogoves will burble, then the statement \"Only borogoves will burble\" implies that *nothing* will burble (because if something burbled, it would have to be a borogove, but borogoves don't burble). While it might be true that nothing burbles, the statement \"Only borogoves will burble\" is fundamentally flawed by the premise that borogoves don't burble. If borogoves don't burble, then it cannot be true that *only* borogoves burble (because they don't).\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **5. Not all borogoves will burble.**\n    *   This means \"There exists at least one borogove that will *not* burble.\"\n    *   We are given \"No borogoves will burble,\" which means *all* borogoves will not burble.\n    *   If all borogoves will not burble, then it is certainly true that *not all* borogoves will burble (in fact, none will). This is a weaker statement that is necessarily true if the stronger statement (\"No borogoves will burble\") is true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **6. Zindle and Bungo will burble.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about Zindle or Bungo bubbling.\n    *   Therefore, we **cannot determine** if this is true or false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information \"no borogoves will burble,\" only statement 5 is necessarily true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets, and their union is everything.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Tove Snicker-Snacking (TSS):** \"No toves snicker-snacked a tove.\" This is a crucial negative statement. It means: $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\forall y (T(y) \\implies \\neg \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)))$. In simpler terms, no tove snicker-snacked any tove.\n4.  **Rath Snicker-Snacking (RSS):** \"A rath snicker-snacked a tove.\" This means: $\\exists x (R(x) \\land \\exists y (T(y) \\land \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)))$.\n5.  **Zindle:** \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.\" $\\neg \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Zindle})$.\n6.  **Rafin:** \"Rafin isn't a tove.\" $\\neg T(\\text{Rafin})$.\n7.  **Rath Whiffle (RW):** \"Every rath will whiffle or it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.\" This can be written as: $\\forall x (R(x) \\implies (\\text{Whiffle}(x) \\lor \\neg T(\\text{Rafin})))$.\n8.  **Borogove Snicker-Snacking (BSS) & Rath Galumphing (RG):** \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\" This is a conditional statement of the form P only if Q, which means Q implies P, or $\\neg P \\implies \\neg Q$.\n    *   Let P = \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo\" ($\\forall x (B(x) \\implies \\neg \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, \\text{Bungo}))$).\n    *   Let Q = \"Every rath galumphed over Rafin\" ($\\forall x (R(x) \\implies \\text{Galumphed}(x, \\text{Rafin}))$).\n    *   So the statement is: $Q \\implies P$, or $(\\forall x (R(x) \\implies \\text{Galumphed}(x, \\text{Rafin}))) \\implies (\\forall x (B(x) \\implies \\neg \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, \\text{Bungo})))$.\n\n**Analysis of the Statements to be Evaluated:**\n\nWe need to determine which of the following statements *must* be true given the information. The key piece of information for these statements is \"No toves snicker-snacked a tove.\" This directly contradicts any statement that claims a tove *did* snicker-snack a tove.\n\nLet's re-state the crucial information:\n**\"No toves snicker-snacked a tove.\"**\nThis means: For any entity X, if X is a tove, then X did not snicker-snack any tove.\nAnd also: For any entity Y, if Y is a tove, then no tove snicker-snacked Y.\n\nLet's examine each statement:\n\n**1. Every tove snicker-snacked a tove.**\n    *   This statement claims: $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\exists y (T(y) \\land \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)))$.\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No toves snicker-snacked a tove.\" If no tove snicker-snacked *any* tove, then it's impossible for *every* tove to have snicker-snacked *a* tove.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 1 must be **false**.\n\n**2. There is a tove that every tove snicker-snacked.**\n    *   This statement claims: $\\exists y (T(y) \\land \\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)))$.\n    *   This means there exists some specific tove (let's call it 'y') such that *every* tove snicker-snacked 'y'.\n    *   However, we know \"No toves snicker-snacked a tove.\" This means for any tove 'x' and any tove 'y', 'x' did not snicker-snack 'y'.\n    *   If no tove snicker-snacked any tove, then it's impossible for every tove to have snicker-snacked a specific tove 'y'.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 2 must be **false**.\n\n**3. A tove snicker-snacked a tove.**\n    *   This statement claims: $\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\exists y (T(y) \\land \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)))$.\n    *   This is the direct negation of \"No toves snicker-snacked a tove.\"\n    *   Since \"No toves snicker-snacked a tove\" is given as true, its negation (\"A tove snicker-snacked a tove\") must be **false**.\n\n**4. A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.**\n    *   This statement claims: $\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\forall y (\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x) \\implies \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)))$.\n    *   Let's consider the implications of \"No toves snicker-snacked a tove.\"\n    *   If 'x' is a tove, then 'x' did not snicker-snack any tove. So, $\\neg \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)$ for any tove 'y'.\n    *   Also, if 'y' is a tove, then 'y' did not snicker-snack 'x' (if 'x' is a tove). So, $\\neg \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x)$ for any tove 'y'.\n    *   The implication $\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x) \\implies \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)$ is a conditional.\n    *   If 'x' is a tove, then the premise $\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x)$ can only be true if 'y' is *not* a tove (because no tove snicker-snacked a tove).\n    *   Let's assume there exists such a tove 'x'.\n        *   If 'x' is a tove, then we know $\\neg \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)$ for any tove 'y'.\n        *   The statement says: $\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\forall y (\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x) \\implies \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)))$.\n        *   Consider a tove 'x'. For the implication $\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x) \\implies \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)$ to be true for all 'y':\n            *   If 'y' is a tove, then $\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x)$ is false (because no tove snicker-snacked a tove). So the implication is true (False $\\implies$ Anything is True).\n            *   If 'y' is *not* a tove (e.g., a rath or a borogove), then $\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x)$ *could* be true (e.g., a rath snicker-snacked a tove, as per given info).\n            *   If $\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x)$ is true (where 'y' is not a tove and 'x' is a tove), then we need $\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)$ to be true.\n            *   But 'x' is a tove. Can a tove snicker-snack something that is *not* a tove? The given information \"No toves snicker-snacked a tove\" only restricts toves snicker-snacking *toves*. It doesn't say anything about toves snicker-snacking borogoves or raths.\n            *   So, it's *possible* for a tove 'x' to snicker-snack a non-tove 'y'.\n            *   However, the statement is \"A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.\"\n            *   Let 'x' be a tove. The set of things that snicker-snacked 'x' *and are also toves* is empty (because no tove snicker-snacked a tove).\n            *   So, for any tove 'x', the clause \"every tove that snicker-snacked it\" refers to an empty set.\n            *   \"A tove snicker-snacked every member of an empty set\" is vacuously true.\n            *   Therefore, for any tove 'x', the condition \"$\\forall y (\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x) \\land T(y) \\implies \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y))$\" is true because the premise $\\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x) \\land T(y)$ is always false.\n            *   The statement is \"A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.\" This means $\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\forall y ((T(y) \\land \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x)) \\implies \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)))$.\n            *   Since \"No toves snicker-snacked a tove\", the antecedent $(T(y) \\land \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(y, x))$ is always false.\n            *   Therefore, the implication is always true for any tove 'x'.\n            *   Since there is at least one tove, this statement must be **true**.\n\n**5. A tove snicker-snacked every tove.**\n    *   This statement claims: $\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\forall y (T(y) \\implies \\text{Snicker-Snacked}(x, y)))$.\n    *   This means there exists a specific tove 'x' such that 'x' snicker-snacked *every* tove.\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No toves snicker",

If there's a borogove (B1) that every tove galumphed over, then it's true that *some* toves (in fact, *all* toves) galumphed over *a* borogove (B1).\n*   Therefore, statement 1 is **false**.\n\n**Statement 2: A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n*   From given information #2: \"There is a borogove (B1) that every tove galumphed over.\" This means for any T, T galumphed over B1.\n*   Statement 2 says: There exists a T (let's call it T_x) such that for every B, T_x galumphed over B.\n*   The given information only guarantees that *every* tove galumphed over *one specific* borogove (B1).

If every tove will whiffle, then it's impossible for there to be a tove that will not whiffle.\n*   Therefore, statement 5 is **logically impossible** and cannot be true in any situation.\n\n**Statement 6: No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n*   From given information #2: \"There is a borogove (B1) that every tove galumphed over.\"\n*   Statement 6 says: For every T, it is not the case that (T galumphed over every B).\n*   This means: For every T, there exists a B such that T did not galumph over B.\n*   The given information only tells us about B1. It doesn't tell us if any tove galumphed over *all* borogoves.\n*   Consider a scenario where there is only one borogove (B1). In this case, \"every tove galumphed over B1\" would mean \"every tove galumphed over every borogove.\" If this were the case, then statement 6 (\"No toves galumphed over every borogove\") would be false.\n*   Consider a scenario where there are multiple borogoves (B1, B2). Every tove galumphed over B1. It's possible that no tove galumphed over B2. In this case, it would be true that no tove galumphed over *every* borogove (because they didn't galumph over B2).\n*   The given information does not force this statement to be true. It's possible for a tove to galumph over every borogove if there's only one borogove.\n*   Therefore, statement 6 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

For example, it's possible that no toves chortle at each other, or only some do.\n    *   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**3. Every tove chortled at a tove.**\n    *   This means for every tove $x$, there exists at least one tove $y$ such that $C(x, y)$.\n    *   The given information states \"Rafin chortled at a tove.\" This tells us something about Rafin's action, but it doesn't guarantee that *every* tove chortled at *a* tove. For instance, there could be a tove that chortled at no one.\n    *   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**4. A tove chortled at a tove.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one tove $x$ and at least one tove $y$ such that $C(x, y)$.\n    *   We are told \"Rafin chortled at a tove.\"\n        *   Case 1: Rafin is a tove. If Rafin is a tove, then Rafin ($x$) chortled at some tove ($y$). So, $C(x, y)$ is true, and $x$ is a tove, $y$ is a tove. This satisfies the statement.\n        *   Case 2: Rafin is not a tove (i.e., Rafin is a borogove or a rath). In this case, the statement \"Rafin chortled at a tove\" does not directly tell us about a tove chortling at a tove. However, the problem states \"Every tove chortled at every tove that chortled at it.\" This rule implies that if *any* tove chortled at *any other* tove, then the relationship is symmetric. But it doesn't guarantee that such a chortling event *happened*.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate. The problem states \"Rafin chortled at a tove.\" Let this tove be T1. So, $C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{T1})$.\n        *   If Rafin is a tove, then $C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{T1})$ means a tove (Rafin) chortled at a tove (T1). So, statement 4 is true.\n        *   If Rafin is *not* a tove, then $C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{T1})$ does not directly imply that a tove chortled at a tove. It only implies that a non-tove chortled at a tove.\n    *   Is there any other information that forces a tove to chortle at a tove? No. The \"Tove Chortling Rule\" only describes the *nature* of the chortling relationship *if* it exists among toves. It doesn't guarantee its existence.\n    *   Consider a scenario: Toves T1, T2. Borogoves B1. Raths R1. Rafin is B1. B1 chortled at T1. No tove chortled at any other tove. This scenario is consistent with all given information, but statement 4 (\"A tove chortled at a tove\") would be false.\n    *   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**5. A tove chortled at every tove.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one tove $x$ such that for every tove $y$, $C(x, y)$ is true.\n    *   This is a stronger statement than \"Every tove chortled at a tove\" (statement 3) and \"Every tove chortled at every tove\" (statement 2). Since 2 and 3 are not necessarily true, this one is also unlikely to be true.\n    *   The given rules do not provide any information that would force such a universal chortling from a single tove.\n    *   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**6. No toves chortled at every tove.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 5. If statement 5 is \"A tove chortled at every tove,\" then statement 6 is \"It is NOT the case that (A tove chortled at every tove).\"\n    *   Since statement 5 does not necessarily have to be true, its negation (statement 6) does not necessarily have to be true either. It's possible that a tove *did* chortle at every tove.\n    *   **Does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**Revisiting Statement 1:**\n\n\"A tove chortled at every tove that chortled at it.\"\nThe original rule is: \"Every tove chortled at every tove that chortled at it.\"\nLet's formalize the original rule: $\\forall x \\in T, \\forall y \\in T, (C(y, x) \\implies C(x, y))$.\nStatement 1: $\\exists x \\in T, (\\forall y \\in T, (C(y, x) \\implies C(x, y)))$.\nSince the original rule states that *every* tove ($x$) satisfies the condition $(\\forall y \\in T, (C(y, x) \\implies C(x, y)))$, it logically follows that *at least one* tove satisfies this condition. Therefore, statement 1 must be true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   **Statement 1:** Directly follows from the \"Every tove chortled at every tove that chortled at it\" rule. If *every* tove has a property, then *a* tove (meaning at least one) must have that property. **TRUE.**\n*   **Statement 2:** \"Every tove chortled at every tove.\" No, the rule only implies symmetry, not universal chortling.\n*   **Statement 3:** \"Every tove chortled at a tove.\" No, we only know Rafin chortled at *a* tove. We don't know if *every* tove chortled at *any* tove.\n*   **Statement 4:** \"A tove chortled at a tove.\" This is only true if Rafin is a tove. If Rafin is a borogove and chortled at a tove, and no toves chortled at other toves, this statement would be false.\n*   **Statement 5:** \"A tove chortled at every tove.\" No, this is a very strong claim not supported by the rules.\n*   **Statement 6:** \"No toves chortled at every tove.\" This is the negation of statement 5. Since statement 5 is not necessarily true, its negation is also not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Bungo and Zindle gyred:** This is a direct statement of fact. Let's denote \"X gyred\" as G(X). So, G(Bungo) and G(Zindle).\n4.  **Rath snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it:** This is a conditional statement about the \"snicker-snacked\" relationship. If a borogove (b) snicker-snacked a rath (r), then that rath (r) snicker-snacked that borogove (b). Let S(X, Y) mean \"X snicker-snacked Y\". So, for any rath r and borogove b, if S(b, r), then S(r, b).\n5.  **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin gyred:** This is a complex statement. Let's break it down:\n    *   \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" means there exists at least one tove (t) such that t did not snicker-snack Zindle (\u00acS(t, Zindle)).\n    *   \"Rafin gyred\" means G(Rafin).\n    *   The \"and\" connects these two parts. So, (\u2203t \u2208 T such that \u00acS(t, Zindle)) AND G(Rafin).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the given information, especially point 5. The phrasing \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin gyred\" is ambiguous. It could mean:\n\n*   **(Interpretation A):** (Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle) AND (Rafin gyred).\n*   **(Interpretation B):** It is not the case that (all toves snicker-snacked Zindle AND Rafin gyred).\n\nLet's assume **Interpretation A** as it's the more common way to parse such a sentence structure in logical reasoning problems unless punctuation suggests otherwise.\n\nSo, based on **Interpretation A**:\nFrom (3): G(Bungo) and G(Zindle).\nFrom (5): (\u2203t \u2208 T such that \u00acS(t, Zindle)) AND G(Rafin).\n\nThis directly tells us:\n*   G(Zindle) is true.\n*   G(Rafin) is true.\n*   G(Bungo) is true.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n1.  **Zindle gyred but it is not the case that Rafin gyred.**\n    *   We know G(Zindle) is true from (3).\n    *   We know G(Rafin) is true from (5).\n    *   Therefore, \"it is not the case that Rafin gyred\" is false.\n    *   So, this statement is (True AND False), which is False.\n\n2.  **Zindle is a tove.**\n    *   We know Zindle gyred. We know everything is a tove, borogove, or rath.\n    *   However, the information given does not specify Zindle's category. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. There's no information to determine this.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is Not Necessarily True.\n\n3.  **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n    *   We know G(Zindle) is true from (3).\n    *   Therefore, \"Zindle didn't gyre\" is False.\n\n4.  **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n    *   We know G(Zindle) is true from (3).\n    *   We know G(Rafin) is true from (5).\n    *   Therefore, (G(Zindle) AND G(Rafin)) is (True AND True), which is True.\n\n5.  **Rafin didn't gyre.**\n    *   We know G(Rafin) is true from (5).\n    *   Therefore, \"Rafin didn't gyre\" is False.\n\n6.  **Bungo didn't gyre.**\n    *   We know G(Bungo) is true from (3).\n    *   Therefore, \"Bungo didn't gyre\" is False.\n\n**Conclusion based on Interpretation A:**\nOnly statement 4 must be true.\n\n---\n\nLet's briefly consider **Interpretation B** for \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin gyred\":\nIt is not the case that (all toves snicker-snacked Zindle AND Rafin gyred).\nThis means: \u00ac ( (\u2200t \u2208 T, S(t, Zindle)) AND G(Rafin) )\nWhich is equivalent to: (\u2203t \u2208 T, \u00acS(t, Zindle)) OR \u00acG(Rafin)\n\nIf this interpretation were used:\n*   We still know G(Bungo) and G(Zindle) from (3).\n*   From (5) under Interpretation B: (\u2203t \u2208 T, \u00acS(t, Zindle)) OR \u00acG(Rafin).\n    *   This means either there's a tove that didn't snicker-snack Zindle, OR Rafin didn't gyre.\n    *   This doesn't *force* G(Rafin) to be true. It only tells us that if all toves *did* snicker-snack Zindle, then Rafin *must not* have gyred.\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"Not all X and Y\" typically means \"(Not all X) and Y\". For example, \"Not all students passed and the teacher was happy\" means \"It's not true that all students passed, AND the teacher was happy.\" If it meant \"It's not true that (all students passed AND the teacher was happy)\", it would usually be phrased as \"It's not true that all students passed and the teacher was happy\" or \"It's not the case that (all students passed and the teacher was happy)\".\n\nGiven the common interpretation of such sentence structures in logical puzzles, **Interpretation A** is the most likely intended meaning.\n\nUnder **Interpretation A**, the only statement that must be true is 4.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

This is equivalent to P $\\implies$ Q.\nSo, \"Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\" $\\implies$ \"Not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n\nLet's consider the truth value of P:\n*   If P is true (Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin), then Q must be true (Not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin).\n    However, if \"Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true, then \"Not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be false.\n    This creates a contradiction: True $\\implies$ False. This is impossible.\n*   Therefore, P must be false.\n\n**Conclusion from Statement 7:** It is NOT true that \"Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\nThis means that **\"Not every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\"** or equivalently, **\"At least one rath did not snicker-snack Rafin.\"**\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **1. A rath chortled at Zindle.**\n    From statement 6: \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" Since there's at least one rath (from statement 2), it follows that *a* rath (meaning at least one) chortled at Zindle.\n    **This statement must be true.**\n\n*   **2. Zindle and Rafin are uffish.**\n    From statement 3: \"Zindle is uffish.\"\n    We have no information about Rafin's uffishness.\n    **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **3. Zindle chortled at a rath.**\n    We know \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" (statement 6). This tells us about raths chortling at Zindle, not Zindle chortling at raths. We have no information about Zindle's chortling habits towards raths.\n    **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **4. No raths chortled at Zindle.**\n    From statement 6: \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" This directly contradicts \"No raths chortled at Zindle.\"\n    **This statement must be false.**\n\n*   **5. Zindle chortled at every rath.**\n    Similar to statement 3, we have no information about Zindle's chortling habits towards raths.\n    **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n*   **6. Not all raths chortled at Zindle.**\n    From statement 6: \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" This means \"All raths chortled at Zindle.\"\n    \"Not all raths chortled at Zindle\" is the negation of \"All raths chortled at Zindle.\"\n    Since \"All raths chortled at Zindle\" is true, its negation \"Not all raths chortled at Zindle\" must be false.\n    **This statement must be false.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   Statement 1: \"A rath chortled at Zindle.\" (True, because \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" and there's at least one rath).\n*   Statement 2: \"Zindle and Rafin are uffish.\" (Unknown for Rafin).\n*   Statement 3: \"Zindle chortled at a rath.\" (Unknown).\n*   Statement 4: \"No raths chortled at Zindle.\" (False, contradicts \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\").\n*   Statement 5: \"Zindle chortled at every rath.\" (Unknown).\n*   Statement 6: \"Not all raths chortled at Zindle.\" (False, contradicts \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\").\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is statement 1.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

A rath chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   The given information states: \"every rath chortled at Zindle.\" If *every* rath chortled at Zindle, then it logically follows that *at least one* rath (i.e., \"a rath\") chortled at Zindle.

Zindle is beamish.**\n    *   The only information about \"beamish\" is \"Not all borogoves are beamish.\" This tells us nothing about Zindle's beamishness. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. Even if Zindle were a borogove, we only know *not all* borogoves are beamish, so Zindle could still be beamish or not.

(This statement seems to be a distractor as it doesn't relate to galumphing or the other logical deductions).\n4.  **Toves & Galumphing (Self-Referential):** Every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\n    *   Let 'x' be a tove.\n    *   This means: For every T_x, there exists a T_y such that T_x galumphed over T_y, AND T_y galumphed over T_x.\n    *   This implies a symmetric relationship for at least one pair for every tove.\n    *   Crucially, this means that if there's at least one tove, then there must be at least one instance of a tove galumphing over another tove.\n5.  **Conditional (Rafin & Raths):** If Rafin is a tove, then every rath galumphed over Rafin only if no raths galumphed over Bungo. (This statement also seems to be a distractor as it doesn't relate to the galumphing relationships *among toves*).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's focus on the implications of statement (4): \"Every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\"\n\n*   Let T be the set of all toves.\n*   Let G(x, y) mean \"x galumphed over y\".\n*   Statement (4) translates to: For every x in T, there exists a y in T such that G(x, y) and G(y, x).\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n1.  **There is a tove that every tove galumphed over.**\n    *   This means: Exists T_x such that for all T_y, G(T_y, T_x).\n    *   Does statement (4) guarantee this? No. Statement (4) only guarantees a *pair* for each tove, not a single tove that *all* others galumphed over.\n\n2.  **Every tove galumphed over every tove.**\n    *   This means: For all T_x, for all T_y, G(T_x, T_y).\n    *   Does statement (4) guarantee this? No. Statement (4) only guarantees a *specific symmetric pair* for each tove, not that every tove galumphs over *every other* tove.\n\n3.  **No toves galumphed over every tove.**\n    *   This means: For all T_x, it is NOT the case that (for all T_y, G(T_x, T_y)).\n    *   This is the negation of \"A tove galumphed over every tove\" (statement 5).\n    *   Statement (4) doesn't directly prove or disprove this. It's possible that one tove galumphs over all others, and still satisfies the condition of having a symmetric partner. For example, if there are only two toves, T1 and T2, and T1 galumphs over T2, and T2 galumphs over T1. Then T1 galumphed over every tove (T2), and T2 galumphed over every tove (T1). So this statement would be false in that scenario.\n\n4.  **A tove galumphed over a tove.**\n    *   This means: There exists T_x and there exists T_y such that G(T_x, T_y).\n    *   From statement (4): \"Every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one tove (from the \"Existence\" rule), let's call it T1.\n    *   According to statement (4), T1 must have galumphed over *some* tove (let's call it T2) such that T2 also galumphed over T1.\n    *   Therefore, T1 galumphed over T2. This directly proves that \"A tove galumphed over a tove.\"\n    *   This statement *must* be true.\n\n5.  **A tove galumphed over every tove.**\n    *   This means: There exists T_x such that for all T_y, G(T_x, T_y).\n    *   Does statement (4) guarantee this? No. Consider a scenario with three toves: T1, T2, T3.\n        *   T1 galumphs over T2, T2 galumphs over T1.\n        *   T3 galumphs over T3 (self-loop, which is allowed by the wording \"a tove that galumphed over it\").\n        *   In this scenario, no single tove galumphs over *every* tove (T1 doesn't galumph over T3, T2 doesn't galumph over T3, T3 doesn't galumph over T1 or T2). Yet, statement (4) is satisfied. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **No toves galumphed over a tove.**\n    *   This means: For all T_x, for all T_y, it is NOT the case that G(T_x, T_y).\n    *   This is the direct opposite of statement (4). If no toves galumphed over a tove, then statement (4) (\"Every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it\") would be false.\n    *   Since statement (4) is given as true, this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information, particularly \"Every tove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it\" and the existence of at least one tove, is that there must be at least one instance of a tove galumphing over another tove.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(R -> Uffish)\n2.  **Tove Chortling:** No toves chortled at Bungo. (T -> Not chortled at Bungo)\n3.  **Rath Action:** A rath galumphed over Zindle. (Exists R such that R galumphed over Zindle)\n4.  **Tove Action:** Every tove gyred. (T -> Gyred)\n5.  **Gyring Condition:** Only toves gyred OR every tove galumphed over Rafin. (Only T gyred OR (T -> galumphed over Rafin))\n\n**Analyzing the Gyring Condition (Rule 5):**\n\nThis rule is crucial: \"Only toves gyred OR every tove galumphed over Rafin.\"\nLet's call the first part P1: \"Only toves gyred.\"\nLet's call the second part P2: \"Every tove galumphed over Rafin.\"\nSo, (P1 OR P2) is true.\n\n**From Rule 4:** \"Every tove gyred.\" This means if something is a tove, it gyred. (T -> Gyred)\n\n**Consider P1: \"Only toves gyred.\"**\nIf P1 is true, it means:\n*   If something gyred, it must be a tove. (Gyred -> T)\n*   Combined with (T -> Gyred) from Rule 4, this means that the set of things that gyred is exactly the set of toves.\n\n**Consider P2: \"Every tove galumphed over Rafin.\"**\nIf P2 is true, then all toves performed this action.\n\n**Let's evaluate the given statements:**\n\n**Statement 1: Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n\n*   We know \"A rath galumphed over Zindle\" (Rule 3). This tells us something about Zindle, but not whether Zindle gyred. Zindle is a *thing*, and could be a tove, borogove, or rath.\n*   If Zindle is a tove, Zindle gyred (Rule 4).\n*   If Zindle is a borogove or rath, Zindle might not have gyred (if P1 is true).\n*   We don't know if Rafin gyred. Rafin is a *thing*.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n\n*   Similar to Statement 1, we don't know if Zindle gyred.\n*   We know \"No toves chortled at Bungo\" (Rule 2). This tells us about Bungo being chortled *at*, not about Bungo *gyring*. Bungo is a *thing*.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: Zindle didn't gyre.**\n\n*   We know \"A rath galumphed over Zindle\" (Rule 3).\n*   If Zindle is a tove, then Zindle *did* gyre (Rule 4).\n*   If Zindle is a borogove or a rath, then Zindle *might* not have gyred (if P1 is true).\n*   Since Zindle *could* be a tove, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle gyred.**\n\n*   We know \"A rath galumphed over Zindle\" (Rule 3). This means Zindle is a *thing* that was galumphed over by a rath.\n*   Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n*   If Zindle is a tove, then Zindle gyred (Rule 4).\n*   If Zindle is a borogove or a rath, then Zindle *might not* have gyred (if P1 is true).\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: Zindle is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n\n*   \"A rath galumphed over Zindle\" is directly stated in Rule 3. So the second part is true.\n*   \"Zindle is uffish\": We know \"A rath is uffish\" (Rule 1). This means if something is a rath, it's uffish.\n*   However, Zindle is a *thing* that was galumphed over by a rath. Zindle itself is not necessarily a rath. Zindle could be a tove or a borogove.\n*   For example, a rath could galumph over a tove. In that case, the tove (Zindle) would not be uffish.\n*   Therefore, \"Zindle is uffish\" is not necessarily true.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: A rath is uffish and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n\n*   \"A rath is uffish\" is directly stated in Rule 1. This is true.\n*   \"A rath galumphed over Zindle\" is directly stated in Rule 3. This is true.\n*   Since both conjuncts are directly stated as true in the problem description, their conjunction must be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 6 must be true based on the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

This means T, B, and R are mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories.\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Toves & Rafin:** No toves chortled at Rafin. (Let C(x, y) mean x chortled at y). So, for all x, if x is T, then not C(x, Rafin).\n*   **Borogoves & Zindle:** Every borogove chortled at Zindle. So, for all x, if x is B, then C(x, Zindle).\n*   **Rafin's Category:** Rafin isn't a tove. (Rafin is not T).\n*   **Rafin & Bungo:** It is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo. This means Rafin *did* chortle at Bungo. (C(Rafin, Bungo)).\n*   **Rafin & Self-Chortle / Borogoves & Zindle (Galumphing):** Rafin chortled at Rafin if and only if not all borogoves galumphed over Zindle.

So, C(Rafin, Rafin) <=> NOT (for all x, if x is B, then G(x, Zindle)).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n**1. Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n\n*   Let P be the proposition \"Every borogove is mimsy.\"\n*   Let Q be the proposition \"Not all borogoves are mimsy.\"\n*   The statement is \"P just in case Q\", which means P <=> Q.\n*   If P is true, then \"Every borogove is mimsy\" is true. This implies that there are no borogoves that are *not* mimsy. Therefore, \"Not all borogoves are mimsy\" (Q) must be false. So, P => not Q.\n*   If Q is true, then \"Not all borogoves are mimsy\" is true. This means there is at least one borogove that is *not* mimsy. Therefore, \"Every borogove is mimsy\" (P) must be false. So, Q => not P.\n*   Combining these, P <=> not Q.\n*   The statement given is P <=> Q. This is a contradiction unless both P and Q are false, which is not necessarily the case. For example, if P is true, then Q must be false, so P <=> Q would be True <=> False, which is False.

We don't know if C(Rafin, Toby) is true or false.\n*   This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n\n*   From the given information: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" (This is true).\n*   From the given information: \"Rafin isn't a tove.\" (This is true).\n*   The statement is a conjunction of two true premises.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**5. No toves chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n\n*   \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" is true (from given).\n*   \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove\" means \"Rafin *is* a tove.\"\n*   However, the given information explicitly states \"Rafin isn't a tove.\"\n*   So, the second part of the conjunction (\"Rafin is a tove\") is false.\n*   Since one part of the conjunction is false, the entire conjunction is false.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**6. Every tove chortled at Rafin.**\n\n*   This is the same as statement 2, just phrased differently.\n*   The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\"\n*   This statement directly contradicts the given information.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

This means if something is mimsy, it's a tove. (M $\\rightarrow$ T).\n*   **Bungo and Mimsy:** It is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy.

(B $\\cap$ M = $\\emptyset$).\n*   If no borogove can be mimsy, then it is *true* that \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" (in fact, *no* borogoves are mimsy).\n*   So, the antecedent of both conditional statements (P) is **TRUE**.\n\n**Consequences of P being TRUE:**\n\nSince P is true, the consequents of both C1 and C2 must also be true.\n\n*   From C1: (R $\\rightarrow$ Q) must be true.\n    *   (Rafin is beamish) $\\rightarrow$ (not all toves chortled at Bungo)\n*   From C2: (R $\\rightarrow$ S) must be true.\n    *   (Rafin is beamish) $\\rightarrow$ (no borogoves are beamish)\n\n**Revisiting Bungo:**\n\nWe established that Bungo is a Tove (Bungo $\\in$ T).\nWe are given that Bungo chortled at Rafin.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\nLet's re-examine the options in light of our deductions. The options are about toves chortling at Rafin, or Rafin chortling at toves.\n\nWe know:\n1.  Bungo is a Tove.\n2.  Bungo chortled at Rafin.\n\nThis means there exists at least one tove (Bungo) that chortled at Rafin.\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n1.  **Rafin chortled at every tove.** We have no information about Rafin chortling at anyone, only Bungo chortling at Rafin. This is not necessarily true.\n2.  **No toves chortled at Rafin.** This contradicts our finding that Bungo (a tove) chortled at Rafin. So, this is false.\n3.  **Not all toves chortled at Rafin.** This means there is at least one tove that *did not* chortle at Rafin. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this. We only know *one* tove (Bungo) *did* chortle at Rafin.\n4.  **Rafin chortled at a tove.** Again, we have no information about Rafin chortling at anyone. This is not necessarily true.\n5.  **Every tove chortled at Rafin.** We only know Bungo (a tove) chortled at Rafin. We don't know about other toves. This is not necessarily true.\n6.  **A tove chortled at Rafin.** Yes, we know Bungo is a tove, and Bungo chortled at Rafin. Therefore, \"A tove chortled at Rafin\" must be true.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe complex conditionals about \"beamish\" and \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" seem to be distractors for this particular question, as the answer can be derived directly from the initial facts about Bungo and Mimsy.\n\n*   Only toves are mimsy (M $\\rightarrow$ T).\n*   Bungo is mimsy (\u00ac(Bungo $\\notin$ M) $\\implies$ Bungo $\\in$ M).\n*   Therefore, Bungo is a Tove (Bungo $\\in$ T).\n*   Bungo chortled at Rafin.\n*   Since Bungo is a Tove and Bungo chortled at Rafin, it logically follows that \"A tove chortled at Rafin.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

Everything is a T, B, or R (exclusively).\n2.  There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  C(B, Zindle) <=> not S(T, Zindle)  (A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle)\n4.  not S(T, Zindle) <=> not C(R, Rafin) (No toves snicker-snacked Zindle if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin)\n5.  not C(Zindle, Rafin) => (S(R, Bungo) => Beamish(R)) (If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath is beamish)\n\n**Analyzing the Premises:**\n\nFrom (3) and (4), we can chain the equivalences:\nC(B, Zindle) <=> not S(T, Zindle) <=> not C(R, Rafin)\n\nThis means:\n**C(B, Zindle) <=> not C(R, Rafin)**\n\nLet's rephrase this: A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n**Statement 1: Every rath chortled at Rafin only if Zindle isn't a borogove.**\n*   This can be written as: C(R, Rafin) => not B(Zindle)\n*   From our derived equivalence: C(B, Zindle) <=> not C(R, Rafin).\n*   This means: C(R, Rafin) <=> not C(B, Zindle).\n*   If C(R, Rafin) is true, then not C(B, Zindle) must be true.\n*   However, the statement says \"Zindle isn't a borogove\". Zindle *is* a tove, borogove, or rath. The premise states \"Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively)\". So Zindle *must* be one of these.\n*   The statement \"Zindle isn't a borogove\" refers to Zindle's *type*, not whether a borogove chortled at Zindle.\n*   We have no information about Zindle's type (T, B, or R).\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Zindle and Bungo are beamish.**\n*   We have no information about Zindle being beamish or Bungo being beamish.\n*   Premise 5 talks about *every rath* being beamish under certain conditions, but not Zindle or Bungo directly.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 3: Zindle is beamish.**\n*   Similar to Statement 2, we have no information about Zindle being beamish.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 4: A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin.**\n*   This is precisely what we derived from premises 3 and 4: **C(B, Zindle) <=> not C(R, Rafin)**.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 5: If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Zindle isn't a borogove.**\n*   This can be written as: C(R, Rafin) => not B(Zindle).\n*   As discussed for Statement 1, \"Zindle isn't a borogove\" refers to Zindle's type. We don't know Zindle's type.\n*   If Zindle *is* a borogove, this statement would be false if C(R, Rafin) is true.\n*   We only know C(R, Rafin) <=> not C(B, Zindle). This tells us about the *action* of a borogove, not Zindle's inherent type.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 6: Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n*   We have no information about Zindle or Rafin being beamish.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true.\n\n**Final Check:**\nThe core deduction is:\n1.  C(B, Zindle) <=> not S(T, Zindle) (Premise 3)\n2.  not S(T, Zindle) <=> not C(R, Rafin) (Premise 4)\nCombining these, we get:\nC(B, Zindle) <=> not C(R, Rafin)\n\nStatement 4 is exactly this derived equivalence.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

It means that for any two toves, say T1 and T2 (they can be the same tove), T1 chortled at T2. This implies a universal chortling relationship among all toves.\n\n**Evaluating Each Statement:**\n\n1.  **Zindle is a tove.**\n    *   We know \"A borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This tells us about the snicker-snacker (a borogove) and the snicker-snacked (Zindle).

Does every tove chortle at T_target? Yes, because \"every tove chortled at every tove\" implies that for any T_source, T_source chortled at T_target.\n    *   Therefore, there *is* a tove (in fact, every tove) that every tove chortled at.\n    *   This statement claims there is *not* such a tove.\n    *   **Conclusion:** False.\n\n4.  **No toves chortled at every tove.**\n    *   This statement means: For every tove T_source, it is *not* the case that T_source chortled at every tove.\n    *   Let's check this against \"Every tove chortled at every tove.\"\n    *   \"Every tove chortled at every tove\" means: For any tove T_source, and any tove T_target, T_source chortled at T_target.\n    *   This directly implies that for any tove T_source, T_source chortled at *every* tove.\n    *   Therefore, the statement \"No toves chortled at every tove\" is false.\n    *   **Conclusion:** False.\n\n5.  **A tove chortled at every tove.**\n    *   The given information states: \"Every tove chortled at every tove.\"\n    *   This means that if you pick *any* tove, say T_A, then T_A chortled at every other tove (including itself).\n    *   Since \"Every tove chortled at every tove\" is true, it necessarily implies that there exists *at least one* tove that chortled at every tove (in fact, *all* toves did).\n    *   **Conclusion:** True.\n\n6.  **No toves chortled at a tove that chortled at it.**\n    *   This statement means: For any tove T1, and any tove T2, if T1 chortled at T2, then T2 did *not* chortle at T1. (Or, more simply, there are no reciprocal chortling relationships).\n    *   The given information states: \"Every tove chortled at every tove.\"\n    *   Let T1 and T2 be any two toves.\n    *   According to the given information, T1 chortled at T2.\n    *   According to the given information, T2 chortled at T1.\n    *   This means that for any pair of toves, they *do* chortle at each other.\n    *   Therefore, the statement \"No toves chortled at a tove that chortled at it\" is false.\n    *   **Conclusion:** False.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n\n**5.

We don't know if Zindle is a tove. Zindle could be a borogove or a rath. Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n2.  **Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   We are given that \"Bungo is a rath\" and \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   Since Bungo is a rath, it logically follows that Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n    *   This statement *must* be true.\n\n3.  **Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n    *   We know that \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" This tells us about raths chortling *at Zindle*. It tells us nothing about Zindle chortling *at anyone else*, including Bungo. Zindle could be a tove, borogove, or rath. If Zindle is a rath, we know Zindle chortled at Zindle (which is nonsensical in typical language, but logically consistent with \"every rath chortled at Zindle\" if Zindle is a rath). However, we have no information about Zindle chortling *at Bungo*. Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n4.  **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n    *   We already determined that \"Zindle will whiffle\" does not *must* be true.\n    *   We also don't know Bungo's whiffling status. Bungo is a rath, and only toves are stated to whiffle. So Bungo will not necessarily whiffle.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n5.  **Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle.**\n    *   This is the direct opposite of statement 2.

Therefore, it does not *must* be true.\n\n6.  **Zindle chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, we have no information about Zindle chortling *at Bungo*. The rule \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" is about raths chortling *at Zindle*, not Zindle chortling *at others*.

This is a double negative, meaning \"Rafin is beamish.\"\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n*   **Statement 1: Zindle gyred.**\n    *   We know \"A rath galumphed over Zindle.\"\n    *   We also know \"Every rath gyred.\"\n    *   However, there's no direct link between being galumphed over and gyring.

There's at least one of each.\n    *   This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets, and their union is everything.\n    *   $T \\neq \\emptyset$, $B \\neq \\emptyset$, $R \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n2.  **Zindle isn't mimsy.** (Irrelevant to the options, but noted)\n\n3.  **Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle.** (Let's denote \"snicker-snacked\" as SS. So, Bungo SS Zindle.)\n\n4.  **Not all toves snicker-snacked Bungo.** (There exists at least one tove that did not SS Bungo.)\n    *   $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\neg (t \\text{ SS Bungo})$.\n\n5.  **Every tove galumphed over every borogove that galumphed over it.** (Let's denote \"galumphed over\" as GO.)\n    *   $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\text{ if } (b \\text{ GO } t) \\text{ then } (t \\text{ GO } b)$.\n    *   This is a conditional statement about the relationship between toves and borogoves. It doesn't say anything about whether any galumphing actually occurred, only how it behaves if it does.\n\n6.  **Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Bungo just in case every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n    *   \"P just in case Q\" means \"P if and only if Q\" (P $\\iff$ Q).\n    *   So, $\\neg (Zindle \\text{ SS Bungo}) \\iff (\\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ SS Bungo})$.\n\n**Analysis of Statement 6:**\n\n*   From statement 3, we know \"Bungo SS Zindle\".\n*   Statement 6 says: $\\neg (Zindle \\text{ SS Bungo}) \\iff (\\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ SS Bungo})$.\n*   This statement is about Zindle *being snicker-snacked by* Bungo, not Zindle *snicker-snacking* Bungo.\n*   Let's re-read carefully: \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Bungo\". This means $\\neg (Bungo \\text{ SS Zindle})$.\n*   But statement 3 says \"Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle\". This means $(Bungo \\text{ SS Zindle})$.\n*   So, statement 6 implies: $(Bungo \\text{ SS Zindle}) \\iff (\\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ SS Bungo})$.\n*   Since we know $(Bungo \\text{ SS Zindle})$ is true (from statement 3), then it must be true that $(\\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ SS Bungo})$.\n*   **Conclusion from 3 & 6:** Every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo. ($\\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ SS Bungo}$).\n\n**Now let's evaluate the options based on all derived information:**\n\n**Option 1: A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n*   This statement claims existence: $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } (t \\text{ GO } b)$.\n*   The given information (especially statement 5) describes a *conditional* relationship for galumphing, but it doesn't assert that any galumphing actually happened. It's possible no tove ever galumphed over any borogove, and no borogove ever galumphed over any tove.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 2: A tove galumphed over every borogove that galumphed over it.**\n*   This statement says: $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } (\\forall b \\in B, \\text{ if } (b \\text{ GO } t) \\text{ then } (t \\text{ GO } b))$.\n*   Statement 5 says: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\text{ if } (b \\text{ GO } t) \\text{ then } (t \\text{ GO } b)$.\n*   Statement 5 is a universal quantification. If \"Every tove galumphed over every borogove that galumphed over it\" is true, then it must be true that \"A tove galumphed over every borogove that galumphed over it\" (because \"every\" implies \"at least one\").\n*   This statement is directly implied by statement 5.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Option 3: No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n*   This statement says: $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } (\\forall b \\in B, t \\text{ GO } b))$.\n*   This is equivalent to: $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg (\\forall b \\in B, t \\text{ GO } b)$.\n*   Which is equivalent to: $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } \\neg (t \\text{ GO } b)$.\n*   The given information does not provide enough details about the \"galumphing\" relationship to confirm or deny this. It's possible that some tove *did* galumph over every borogove, or that no tove did. We simply don't know.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 4: Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n*   This statement says: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, (t \\text{ GO } b)$.\n*   This is a very strong claim. The given information (statement 5) is conditional: \"IF a borogove galumphed over a tove, THEN the tove galumphed over that borogove.\" It does not say that toves galumphed over *all* borogoves, or even any borogoves.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 5: Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n*   This statement says: $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } (t \\text{ GO } b)$.\n*   Similar to option 4, this asserts that galumphing *happened* for every tove. The given information does not support this. It's possible that no tove galumphed over any borogove.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option 6: A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n*   This statement says: $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } (\\forall b \\in B, t \\text{ GO } b)$.\n*   Similar to options 4 and 5, this asserts that galumphing *happened* in a specific way. The given information does not support this.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\n*   Statement 2 is a direct logical consequence of statement 5. If \"Every X has property Y\" is true, then \"At least one X has property Y\" must also be true.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 2.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(This means if X is a tove and Y is a tove, X did not chortle at Y).\n*   **Bungo:** Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n*   **Raths & Zindle:** Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n**Analyzing Bungo's Nature:**\n\n1.  We know \"Bungo chortled at Bungo.\"\n2.  We also know \"No toves chortled at a tove.\"\n3.  If Bungo were a tove, then \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" would mean \"a tove chortled at a tove,\" which contradicts \"No toves chortled at a tove.\"\n4.  Therefore, **Bungo cannot be a tove.**\n\n**Analyzing Zindle's Nature:**\n\n1.  We know \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n2.  We also know \"No toves chortled at a tove.\"\n3.  Consider the possibility that Zindle is a tove.\n4.  We know there's at least one rath. Let's call this rath 'R1'.\n5.  R1 snicker-snacked Zindle. This action (snicker-snacking) is distinct from chortling. The information about toves chortling only applies to chortling, not snicker-snacking.\n6.  Therefore, the information about toves and chortling does not directly constrain Zindle's nature based on raths snicker-snacking Zindle.\n7.  Let's re-evaluate. The problem doesn't give us any direct contradictions for Zindle being a tove or not a tove. The statement \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" doesn't interact with the \"toves chortled at toves\" rule in a way that forces Zindle to be or not be a tove.\n\n**Let's re-examine the options and the remaining statements.**\n\nWe have definitively established: **Bungo isn't a tove.** This matches statement 2.\n\nNow let's look at the other statements to see if we can deduce anything about Rafin or Zindle.\n\n*   \"Rafin is a tove unless a rath galumphed over Bungo.\" (P1: Rafin is T, P2: a rath galumphed over Bungo. So, P1 OR P2 is false. i.e., NOT P1 => P2, or NOT P2 => P1)\n*   \"If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" (Q1: no B snicker-snacked B, Q2: not all B snicker-snacked R. So, Q1 => Q2)\n*   \"If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin is a tove only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\" (R1: every R snicker-snacked B, R2: Rafin is T, R3: every B chortled at B. So, R1 => (R2 => R3))\n\nWe know Bungo is not a tove.\n\nLet's consider the statement \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\".\nIf Bungo is a borogove, then \"a borogove chortled at a borogove\".\nIf Bungo is a rath, then \"a rath chortled at a rath\".\nNeither of these contradicts \"No toves chortled at a tove\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate Zindle.\n\"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\nIf Zindle were a tove, this would mean \"Every rath snicker-snacked a tove.\" This is perfectly fine. There's no rule about raths snicker-snacking toves.\nSo, we cannot conclude anything about Zindle being a tove or not a tove from this statement alone.\n\nLet's look at the options again. We've confirmed **Bungo isn't a tove**. This is option 2.\n\nCan we prove any other options?\n\nConsider the statement: \"If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin is a tove only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nWe don't know if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\nWe don't know if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\nConsider the statement: \"If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n\nWe don't know if no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\nConsider the statement: \"Rafin is a tove unless a rath galumphed over Bungo.\"\nThis means (Rafin is a tove) OR (a rath galumphed over Bungo).\nWe don't know if a rath galumphed over Bungo. So we can't definitively say Rafin is a tove or isn't a tove.\n\nThe only definitive conclusion we could draw was about Bungo's nature based on the \"chortling\" rule.\n\nLet's double check everything.\n\n1.  **Everything is T, B, or R (exclusively). At least one of each.**\n2.  **No toves chortled at a tove.**\n3.  **Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   If Bungo is a Tove, then \"a tove chortled at a tove\", which contradicts (2).\n    *   Therefore, **Bungo is NOT a Tove.** (This confirms statement 2)\n\nNow, let's see if this helps with anything else.\n\n*   **Rafin is a tove unless a rath galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   This means: (Rafin is T) OR (a rath galumphed over Bungo).\n    *   We don't know if a rath galumphed over Bungo. So we can't determine if Rafin is a tove or not.\n\n*   **If no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n    *   We don't know if no borogoves snicker-snacked Bungo. So we can't use this to deduce anything.\n\n*   **If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin is a tove only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   We don't know if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo. So we can't use this to deduce anything.\n\n*   **Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    *   This tells us about raths and Zindle. It doesn't interact with the \"toves chortled at toves\" rule.\n    *   If Zindle is a tove, then \"Every rath snicker-snacked a tove.\" This is perfectly consistent.\n    *   If Zindle is not a tove, this is also consistent.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot determine if Zindle is a tove or not a tove.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that *must* be true is that Bungo isn't a tove.\n\nLet's consider if there's any hidden interaction.\nThe problem asks \"Which, if any, of the following statements must be true in this situation?\" This implies there might be only one, or more than one, or none.\n\nWe have definitively proven that Bungo cannot be a tove. This is a direct contradiction if we assume Bungo is a tove, given the rule about toves chortling.\n\nLet's re-check the options:\n1.  Rafin isn't a tove. (Cannot be proven)\n2.  Bungo isn't a tove. (Proven)\n3.  Zindle isn't a tove. (Cannot be proven)\n4.  Zindle is a tove. (Cannot be proven)\n5.  Rafin is a tove. (Cannot be proven)\n6.  Bungo is a tove. (Proven false)\n\nTherefore, only statement 2 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

Zindle is beamish.**\n*   From \"Only borogoves are beamish\", if Zindle is beamish, then Zindle must be a borogove.\n*   We have no information that forces Zindle to be beamish or a borogove. Zindle could be a tove or a rath, in which case Zindle would not be beamish.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. Only borogoves are beamish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n*   \"Only borogoves are beamish\" is given directly in statement 3. This is TRUE.\n*   \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" is given directly in statement 5. This is TRUE.\n*   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire statement is TRUE.\n\n**3. If Bungo is beamish, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.**\n*   Let's break this down: $A \\implies (B \\implies C)$\n    *   A: \"Bungo is beamish\"\n    *   B: \"Not all toves galumphed over Bungo\"\n    *   C: \"No borogoves are beamish\"\n\n*   Analyze B: \"Not all toves galumphed over Bungo\".\n    *   From statement 5, \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" is true. This means $\\forall x (x \\in T \\implies \\neg \\text{Galumph}(x, \\text{Bungo}))$.\n    *   If no toves galumphed over Bungo, then it is certainly true that \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" (because *none* did). So, B is TRUE.\n\n*   Analyze C: \"No borogoves are beamish\".\n    *   From statement 3, \"Only borogoves are beamish\". This means there *can* be beamish borogoves. Since there's at least one borogove, and \"only borogoves are beamish\" doesn't preclude borogoves from being beamish, it's possible for a borogove to be beamish. In fact, the phrasing \"only borogoves are beamish\" usually implies that there *are* beamish things, and those things are borogoves. If there were *no* beamish things, the statement would still hold, but it's a strong implication. Let's assume \"beamish\" is a property that *can* be held. If there are beamish things, they must be borogoves. If there are no beamish things, then \"no borogoves are beamish\" would be true. However, the common interpretation of \"Only X are Y\" is that the set of Y is a subset of X, and Y is not empty. If Y is empty, then \"No X are Y\" would be true.\n    *   Let's consider the possibility that there are beamish things. If so, they are borogoves. So, \"No borogoves are beamish\" would be FALSE.\n    *   If there are *no* beamish things at all, then \"No borogoves are beamish\" would be TRUE.\n    *   However, the statement \"Only borogoves are beamish\" does not imply that *no* borogoves are beamish. It implies the opposite: if something is beamish, it *must* be a borogove. It doesn't say that borogoves *cannot* be beamish.\n    *   So, C (\"No borogoves are beamish\") is likely FALSE, given the usual interpretation of \"Only borogoves are beamish\" implying that the property \"beamish\" exists and applies to borogoves. If \"beamish\" is a property that exists, then there must be at least one beamish thing, and that thing must be a borogove. Thus, \"No borogoves are beamish\" would be false.\n\n*   So, we have $A \\implies (\\text{TRUE} \\implies \\text{FALSE})$.\n    *   $(\\text{TRUE} \\implies \\text{FALSE})$ evaluates to FALSE.\n    *   So the statement becomes $A \\implies \\text{FALSE}$.\n    *   For this to be true, A must be FALSE.\n    *   A: \"Bungo is beamish\". If Bungo is beamish, then Bungo must be a borogove (from \"Only borogoves are beamish\").\n    *   Is Bungo necessarily *not* beamish? We don't know Bungo's category. If Bungo is a tove or a rath, then Bungo is not beamish. If Bungo is a borogove, Bungo *could* be beamish.\n    *   Since we cannot definitively say Bungo is not beamish, we cannot definitively say this statement is true.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate C: \"No borogoves are beamish\". If this is true, then there are no beamish things at all. This is consistent with \"Only borogoves are beamish\" (the set of beamish things is empty, which is a subset of borogoves). However, it's not a necessary consequence.\n    *   Let's assume \"beamish\" is a property that *can* be true for some entities. If it can be true, then by \"Only borogoves are beamish\", it must be true for some borogoves. Thus, \"No borogoves are beamish\" would be false.\n    *   If \"No borogoves are beamish\" is false, then the consequent $(\\text{TRUE} \\implies \\text{FALSE})$ is false. For the whole implication to be true, the antecedent \"Bungo is beamish\" must be false. This means Bungo is not beamish.\n    *   Is Bungo necessarily not beamish? We don't know Bungo's type. If Bungo is a Tove or a Rath, then Bungo is not beamish. If Bungo is a Borogove, Bungo *could* be beamish.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. If Bungo galumphed over Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish.**\n*   This statement has the same consequent as statement 3: \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish\".\n    *   As analyzed above, \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" is TRUE (because no toves galumphed over Bungo).\n    *   \"no borogoves are beamish\" is likely FALSE (as \"Only borogoves are beamish\" implies beamishness exists among borogoves).\n    *   So, the consequent is (TRUE $\\implies$ FALSE), which is FALSE.\n*   Therefore, the entire statement is \"If Bungo galumphed over Bungo, then FALSE\".\n*   For this implication to be true, the antecedent \"Bungo galumphed",

It does *not* tell us anything about Zindle burbling. Zindle is a proper noun, not a category of creature. We have no information linking Zindle to the act of burbling.\n*   Therefore, this statement **cannot be determined as true**.\n\n**Statement 3: Rafin will burble.**\n*   Similar to Statement 2, we have no information linking Rafin to the act of burbling.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze each statement.\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n*   **Tove, Borogove, Rath:** These are three distinct, exhaustive categories. Every entity belongs to exactly one of these.\n*   **At least one of each:** There is at least one tove, at least one borogove, and at least one rath.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **\"Every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.\"**\n    *   Let B be the set of borogoves.\n    *   Let C(x, y) mean \"x chortled at y\".\n    *   This statement translates to: For all x in B, and for all y in B, if C(y, x) then C(x, y).\n    *   This describes a symmetric relationship for chortling *among borogoves*. If y chortles at x, then x chortles at y.\n\n2.  **\"A rath galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over a borogove.\"**\n    *   Let R be the set of raths, B be the set of borogoves.\n    *   Let G(x, y) mean \"x galumphed over y\".\n    *   This means: There exists r in R, and there exists b1 in B, and there exists b2 in B, such that G(r, b1) and G(b1, b2).\n    *   This implies there are at least two borogoves (b1 and b2) involved in this galumphing chain.\n\n3.  **\"Zindle isn't mimsy and Rafin is a tove.\"**\n    *   This information is about Zindle and Rafin, and their properties (mimsy) or categories (tove). It doesn't seem to directly relate to the chortling or galumphing relationships, or the properties of borogoves, raths, or toves in general, beyond establishing that Rafin is a tove. It doesn't help us determine the truth of the chortling statements.\n\n**Analyzing the Chortling Statements:**\n\nLet's focus on the core chortling rule: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.\"\nThis means if C(y, x) then C(x, y) for any borogoves x, y. This is the definition of a symmetric relation.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n*   **1. A borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means: There exists x in B such that for all y in B, C(x, y).\n    *   Does the given rule imply this? No. The rule only states symmetry. It doesn't guarantee that any borogove chortles at *all* other borogoves (or even itself). For example, if no borogoves chortled at anyone, the rule would still hold (vacuously true).\n\n*   **2. No borogoves chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means: For all x in B, it is NOT the case that (for all y in B, C(x, y)).\n    *   Does the given rule imply this? No. The rule allows for a scenario where a borogove *does* chortle at every borogove. For example, if every borogove chortled at every other borogove (a complete graph), the symmetry rule would hold, and statement 1 would be true, making statement 2 false.\n\n*   **3. A borogove chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   This means: There exists x in B and there exists y in B such that C(x, y).\n    *   Does the given rule imply this? No. The rule is a conditional statement. If there *is* chortling, it must be symmetric. But it doesn't require any chortling to occur at all. It's possible that no borogove chortled at any borogove. In that case, the premise \"y chortled at x\" would always be false, making the implication \"if C(y,x) then C(x,y)\" vacuously true.\n\n*   **4. Every borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This means: For all x in B, and for all y in B, C(x, y).\n    *   Does the given rule imply this? No. This is a very strong statement. The rule only requires symmetry, not universal chortling.\n\n*   **5. A borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.**\n    *   This means: There exists x in B such that for all y in B, if C(y, x) then C(x, y).\n    *   Let's compare this to the given rule: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.\"\n    *   The given rule is: For all x in B, (for all y in B, if C(y, x) then C(x, y)).\n    *   Statement 5 is: There exists x in B such that (for all y in B, if C(y, x) then C(x, y)).\n    *   If something is true for *every* x (the given rule), then it must certainly be true for *at least one* x. Therefore, the given rule implies statement 5.\n\n*   **6. Every borogove chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   This means: For all x in B, there exists y in B such that C(x, y).\n    *   Does the given rule imply this? No. As discussed for statement 3, the rule doesn't require any chortling to occur. It's possible that no borogove chortled at any borogove, in which case this statement would be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 5, because it is a weaker form (existential quantification) of the main premise given about borogoves and chortling (universal quantification). If \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it\" is true, then it must be true that \"A borogove chortled at every borogove that chortled at it.\"\n\nThe information about galumphing, Zindle, and Rafin is irrelevant to the truth of the chortling statements. The existence of at least one borogove is implied by the galumphing statement (a borogove that galumphed over a borogove implies at least two borogoves), but even if we only had one borogove, the symmetry rule would still hold (vacuously or trivially).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(T $\\implies$ Snicker-snacked Zindle)\n4.  **Zindle & Gyring:** Zindle gyred (G) unless Zindle isn't a borogove ($\\neg$B_Zindle). This is a bit tricky. \"A unless B\" means \"A if not B\". So, G if $\\neg$B_Zindle. This can be written as: $\\neg$B_Zindle $\\implies$ G.\n5.  **Snicker-snack Contradiction:** Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle ($\\neg \\forall$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle)) just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle ($\\neg \\exists$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle)).\n    \"Just in case\" means \"if and only if\" ($\\iff$).\n    So, ($\\neg \\forall$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle)) $\\iff$ ($\\neg \\exists$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle)).\n\n**Analysis of Statement 5:**\n\nLet P be the proposition \"all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" ($\\forall$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle)).\nLet Q be the proposition \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" ($\\neg \\exists$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle)).\n\nStatement 5 says: $\\neg$P $\\iff$ Q.\n\nLet's consider the truth values:\n*   If $\\neg$P is true, then Q must be true.\n    *   If \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true, then \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" must be true.\n    *   This implies that if there's at least one tove that *didn't* snicker-snack Zindle, then *no* toves snicker-snacked Zindle. This is a very strong condition.\n*   If $\\neg$P is false, then Q must be false.\n    *   If \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is false, then \"all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (P) is true.\n    *   If P is true, then Q must be false. This means \"it's not true that no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\", which simplifies to \"at least one tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" ($\\exists$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle)). This is consistent: if all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then certainly at least one did.\n\nNow, let's combine this with Statement 3: \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\nThis means P is true: $\\forall$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle).\n\nIf P is true, then from Statement 5 ($\\neg$P $\\iff$ Q), we know that $\\neg$P is false.\nSince $\\neg$P is false, Q must also be false.\nQ is \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" ($\\neg \\exists$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle)).\nIf Q is false, then its negation is true: $\\exists$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle).\nThis means \"at least one tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\nSo, from Statement 3, we know \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true.\nFrom Statement 5, we deduce that \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" must be true (because if it were false, then \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" would have to be true, which contradicts \"every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\").\n\nTherefore, **\"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" is a confirmed truth.**\n\n**Evaluating the Numbered Statements:**\n\nLet's use the confirmed truth: \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\n1.  **Zindle snicker-snacked a tove.**\n    This is the reverse action. We only know toves snicker-snacked Zindle, not the other way around. This statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n2.  **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    This contradicts our confirmed truth (\"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\"). So, this statement must be false.\n\n3.  **Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.**\n    Again, this is the reverse action. We know toves snicker-snacked Zindle, not Zindle snicker-snacked toves. This statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n4.  **Zindle gyred.**\n    From Statement 4: Zindle gyred unless Zindle isn't a borogove ($\\neg$B_Zindle $\\implies$ G).\n    We need to know if Zindle is a borogove or not.\n    If Zindle is a borogove (B_Zindle), then the premise of the implication ($\\neg$B_Zindle) is false, and we can't conclude anything about G.\n    If Zindle is *not* a borogove ($\\neg$B_Zindle), then Zindle must gyre (G).\n\n    Can we determine if Zindle is a borogove?\n    We know \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n    We also know there's at least one tove.\n    So, there exists at least one tove, let's call it T1, such that T1 snicker-snacked Zindle.\n    This means Zindle is something that can be snicker-snacked.\n    Zindle is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n\n    Consider the possibility that Zindle is a borogove. If Zindle is a borogove, then $\\neg$B_Zindle is false, and we cannot conclude Zindle gyred.\n    Consider the possibility that Zindle is *not* a borogove (i.e., Zindle is a tove or a rath). If Zindle is not a borogove, then Zindle gyred.\n\n    We don't have enough information to definitively say whether Zindle is a borogove or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say Zindle gyred.\n\n5.  **No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    This contradicts our confirmed truth (\"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\"). So, this statement must be false.\n\n6.  **A tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    This means \"at least one tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" ($\\exists$T(Snicker-snacked Zindle)).\n    Since we know \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" (and there's at least one tove), it logically follows that \"A tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" must be true.\n\n**Summary of Deductions:**\n\n*   From \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" (Statement 3 in the problem description) and \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (Statement 5 in the problem description), we definitively conclude that \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true.\n*   Since \"Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true, and there is at least one tove, it implies \"A tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true.\n\nTherefore, only statement 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

This means these three categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (tove, borogove, rath).\n3.  **Raths and Uffishness:** Every rath is uffish. (This is a crucial direct statement).\n4.  **Toves and Chortling:** No toves chortled at Rafin.\n5.  **Rafin and Zindle:** It is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle. (This means Rafin did *not* chortle at Zindle).\n6.  **Rath and Galumphing:** A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n7.  **Rafin and Bungo:** Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n**Analysis of Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n*   **Statement 1: No raths are uffish.**\n    *   The given information states: \"Every rath is uffish.\"\n    *   This statement directly contradicts the given information.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 1 must be **false**.\n\n*   **Statement 2: Not all raths are uffish.**\n    *   The given information states: \"Every rath is uffish.\" This means *all* raths are uffish.\n    *   This statement directly contradicts the given information.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 2 must be **false**.\n\n*   **Statement 3: Only raths are uffish.**\n    *   The given information states: \"Every rath is uffish.\" This tells us about raths.\n    *   However, it does *not* tell us whether toves or borogoves can also be uffish. The information only specifies that *if* something is a rath, then it *is* uffish. It doesn't preclude other categories from also being uffish.\n    *   For example, it could be that \"Every rath is uffish\" and \"Some toves are uffish.\" This statement would then be false.\n    *   Since we don't have information to confirm or deny that *only* raths are uffish, this statement does **not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n*   **Statement 4: A rath is uffish.**\n    *   The given information states: \"Every rath is uffish.\"\n    *   The given information also states: \"there's at least one of each\" (tove, borogove, rath).\n    *   Since there is at least one rath, and *every* rath is uffish, it logically follows that *a* rath (meaning at least one rath) must be uffish.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 4 must be **true**.\n\n*   **Statement 5: Zindle and Rafin are uffish.**\n    *   We know \"Every rath is uffish.\"\n    *   We know \"A rath galumphed over Zindle.\" This tells us that *something* (a rath) interacted with Zindle, but it doesn't tell us anything about Zindle's or Rafin's category (tove, borogove, rath) or their uffishness.\n    *   The other statements about chortling (No toves chortled at Rafin, Rafin didn't chortle at Zindle, Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo) also don't provide information about Zindle's or Rafin's uffishness.\n    *   We cannot deduce that Zindle or Rafin are uffish from the given information.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 5 does **not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n*   **Statement 6: Zindle is uffish.**\n    *   Similar to Statement 5, we have no information linking Zindle to the property of being uffish. The fact that a rath galumphed over Zindle doesn't make Zindle a rath, nor does it imply Zindle is uffish.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 6 does **not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only one statement must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets, and their union covers everything.\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Tove Action 1:** A tove galumphed over Rafin. (Let G(x, y) mean x galumphed over y). So, $\\exists t \\in T$ such that G(t, Rafin).\n*   **Tove Action 2 (Negative):** Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. (Let S(x, y) mean x snicker-snacked y). So, $\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, S(t, Zindle))$. This means $\\exists t' \\in T$ such that $\\neg S(t', Zindle)$.\n*   **Borogove Property:** Only borogoves are beamish. (Let Be(x) mean x is beamish). This is a crucial statement. It means:\n    *   If something is beamish, it must be a borogove. ($\\forall x, Be(x) \\implies x \\in B$)\n    *   It does *not* mean all borogoves are beamish.\n*   **Tove Action 3 (Negative):** Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. (This is a repeat of Tove Action 2, so it doesn't add new information).\n*   **Tove Action 4 (Negative):** Not all toves galumphed over Zindle. So, $\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, G(t, Zindle))$. This means $\\exists t'' \\in T$ such that $\\neg G(t'', Zindle)$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"Only borogoves are beamish\" statement.\nThis means: If something is beamish, it is a borogove.\nEquivalently: If something is *not* a borogove, then it is *not* beamish.\nSince everything is exclusively a tove, borogove, or rath, this implies:\n*   If x is a tove, then x is not beamish. ($\\forall t \\in T, \\neg Be(t)$)\n*   If x is a rath, then x is not beamish. ($\\forall r \\in R, \\neg Be(r)$)\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n**1. Only borogoves are beamish and not all toves galumphed over Zindle.**\n*   \"Only borogoves are beamish\" is given as a premise. So this part is true.\n*   \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is also given as a premise. So this part is true.\n*   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire statement is true.\n*   **Must be true.**\n\n**2. Zindle isn't beamish.**\n*   We know that if something is beamish, it must be a borogove.\n*   We don't know what Zindle is (tove, borogove, or rath).\n*   If Zindle is a borogove, Zindle *could* be beamish. The premise \"Only borogoves are beamish\" does not preclude a borogove from being beamish.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say Zindle isn't beamish.\n*   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**3. No toves galumphed over Zindle or no borogoves are beamish.**\n*   \"No toves galumphed over Zindle\" means $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg G(t, Zindle)$. This contradicts the given premise \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" (which means $\\exists t'' \\in T, \\neg G(t'', Zindle)$). So, \"No toves galumphed over Zindle\" is *false*.\n*   \"No borogoves are beamish\" means $\\forall b \\in B, \\neg Be(b)$. This is not given. The premise \"Only borogoves are beamish\" means $\\forall x, Be(x) \\implies x \\in B$. It does not mean that no borogoves are beamish. In fact, it allows for some borogoves to be beamish.\n*   Since the first part (\"No toves galumphed over Zindle\") is false, for the disjunction to be true, the second part (\"no borogoves are beamish\") would have to be true. But we don't know if \"no borogoves are beamish\" is true.\n*   Let's re-examine the first part: \"No toves galumphed over Zindle\" is equivalent to \"It is not the case that some toves galumphed over Zindle\". The given premise is \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle\", which means \"There exists at least one tove that did not galumph over Zindle\". These are different.\n    *   \"No toves galumphed over Zindle\" ($\\forall t \\in T, \\neg G(t, Zindle)$)\n    *   \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" ($\\exists t \\in T, \\neg G(t, Zindle)$)\n    The second one is given as true. The first one is *not* necessarily true. It could be that some toves galumphed over Zindle, and some did not.\n*   So, we cannot determine the truth of \"No toves galumphed over Zindle\".\n*   We also cannot determine the truth of \"no borogoves are beamish\".\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the disjunction.\n*   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**4. No toves galumphed over Zindle unless no borogoves are beamish.**\n*   This is equivalent to: If not (no borogoves are beamish), then no toves galumphed over Zindle.\n*   Or, more simply: (no borogoves are beamish) OR (no toves galumphed over Zindle). This is the same as statement 3.\n*   As established for statement 3, we cannot determine if this is true.\n*   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**5. Zindle is beamish.**\n*   As established for statement 2, we don't know what Zindle is. If Zindle is a tove or a rath, Zindle cannot be beamish. If Zindle is a borogove, Zindle *could* be beamish. We cannot definitively say Zindle is beamish.\n*   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**6. Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n*   From the premise \"Only borogoves are beamish\", we know that if something is beamish, it must be a borogove.\n*   We know \"A tove galumphed over Rafin\". This means Rafin exists.\n*   We don't know what Rafin is. If Rafin is a tove or a rath, Rafin cannot be beamish. If Rafin is a borogove, Rafin *could* be beamish.\n*   We also don't know what Zindle is.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say Zindle and Rafin are beamish.\n*   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true because both of its conjuncts are explicitly stated as premises in the problem description.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Mimsy:** Zindle (Z) or Bungo (Bu) are mimsy (M). This means (Z is M) OR (Bu is M).\n4.  **Borogove & Rafin:** A borogove (B) chortled at Rafin (Ra).\n5.  **Rafin's Uffishness:** It is not the case that Rafin isn't uffish (U). This is a double negative. \"Not (not Uffish)\" means \"Uffish\". So, Rafin is uffish.\n6.  **Zindle Gyred:** Zindle (Z) gyred (G).\n7.  **Rath Gyred:** Every rath (R) gyred (G).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 1: Rafin gyred.**\n*   We know Zindle gyred and every rath gyred. We don't have any information that directly links Rafin to gyring. Rafin could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. If Rafin is a rath, then Rafin gyred. But if Rafin is a tove or a borogove, we don't know if Rafin gyred.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 2: Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n*   We know Zindle gyred (from point 6).\n*   We have no information about whether Bungo gyred.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 3: A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Zindle gyred.**\n*   \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" is true (from point 4).\n*   \"It is not the case that Zindle gyred\" means \"Zindle didn't gyre\".\n*   However, we know from point 6 that \"Zindle gyred\".\n*   So, the second part of the statement (\"Zindle didn't gyre\") is false.\n*   Since the statement is of the form \"A AND B\", and B is false, the entire statement is false.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true (in fact, it must be false).\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n*   We know Zindle gyred (from point 6).\n*   As discussed in Statement 1, we don't know if Rafin gyred.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Zindle didn't gyre.**\n*   We know from point 6 that \"Zindle gyred\".\n*   Therefore, this statement is false.\n*   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true (in fact, it must be false).\n\n**Statement 6: A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred.**\n*   \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" is true (from point 4).\n*   \"Zindle gyred\" is true (from point 6).\n*   Since both parts of the \"AND\" statement are true, the entire statement is true.\n*   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

This is a direct fact.\n\n**Conditional Statements:**\n\n*   **C1: A tove galumphed over Rafin only if not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   (T galumphed over Rafin) $\\rightarrow$ ($\\neg$ All B galumphed over Bungo)\n*   **C2: If Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   ($\\neg$ Bungo SS Bungo) $\\rightarrow$ [($\\neg$ All T galumphed over Zindle) $\\rightarrow$ ($\\neg$ All T galumphed over Bungo)]\n*   **C3: If not all toves galumphed over Zindle, then Rafin won't whiffle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   ($\\neg$ All T galumphed over Zindle) $\\rightarrow$ [($\\neg$ Rafin W) $\\rightarrow$ ($\\neg$ Any R galumphed over Bungo)]\n\n**Analyzing the Facts and Derivations:**\n\n1.  **From B2:** We know \"Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\" This is a direct fact.\n2.  **Consider C2:** The premise of C2 is \"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\" We don't know if this is true or false. If it's true, then the implication holds. If it's false (Bungo *did* snicker-snacked Bungo), then C2's main implication is vacuously true, but we can't derive anything from its consequent.\n\n**Let's evaluate each statement:**\n\n**Statement 1: Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n*   We know a borogove will whiffle. We don't know if Zindle or Bungo are borogoves. We have no information about Zindle or Bungo whiffing.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Statement 2: Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n*   We know a borogove will whiffle. We don't know if Zindle or Rafin are borogoves. We have no information about Zindle or Rafin whiffing.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Statement 3: A borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.**\n*   From B1: \"A borogove will whiffle.\" (B $\\rightarrow$ W)\n*   From B2: \"A borogove is uffish.\" (B $\\rightarrow$ U)\n*   Since there is at least one borogove, this statement is true.\n*   **Must be true.**\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle won't whiffle.**\n*   We have no information about Zindle whiffing or not whiffing.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Statement 5: Zindle will whiffle.**\n*   We have no information about Zindle whiffing or not whiffing.\n*   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Statement 6: Every borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.**\n*   From B1: \"A borogove will whiffle.\" This means *any* borogove will whiffle. So, \"Every borogove will whiffle\" is true.\n*   From B2: \"A borogove is uffish.\" This means *any* borogove is uffish. So, \"Every borogove is uffish\" is true.\n*   Therefore, \"Every borogove is uffish and every borogove will whiffle\" is true.\n*   This statement is stronger than statement 3, but it is also true based on the given premises.\n*   **Must be true.**\n\n**Revisiting Statement 3 vs. Statement 6:**\n\n*   \"A borogove will whiffle\" (B1) implies that if something is a borogove, it whifles. Since there is at least one borogove, it means *some* borogove whifles, and *every* borogove whifles.\n*   \"A borogove is uffish\" (B2) implies that if something is a borogove, it is uffish. Since there is at least one borogove, it means *some* borogove is uffish, and *every* borogove is uffish.\n\nTherefore, both \"A borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle\" (Statement 3) and \"Every borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle\" (Statement 6) are true. Statement 6 is a more precise phrasing of the implication for all borogoves, which is what the original statements B1 and B2 convey.\n\nThe phrasing \"A borogove will whiffle\" and \"A borogove is uffish\" in the problem statement implies a general property of borogoves, meaning *all* borogoves possess these properties. If it meant only *some* borogoves, it would typically be phrased as \"Some borogoves will whiffle\" or \"There exists a borogove that will whiffle.\"\n\nGiven the phrasing, B1 means (for all x, if x is a borogove, then x will whiffle). Similarly for B2.\n\nSo, both 3 and 6 are true. The question asks \"Which, if any, of the following statements must be true\". If multiple are true, we list all of them.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Statement 3: \"A borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.\" This is directly supported by B1 and B2, and the existence of at least one borogove.\n*   Statement 6: \"Every borogove is uffish and a borogove will whiffle.\" This is also directly supported by B1 and B2, as the properties are stated as general characteristics of \"a borogove,\" implying all of them.\n\nThe problem asks which statements *must* be true. Both 3 and 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{3, 6}}$",

This means if something gimbled, it must be a tove.\n*   **Whiffling:** No borogoves will whiffle.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n1.  **Rafin is a Tove and Chortled at Bungo:** We know Ra is a Tove and Ra chortled at Bungo.\n2.  **Zindle is a Tove:** Since Zindle gyred, and \"only toves gimbled\" (assuming \"gyred\" is a synonym or a specific instance of \"gimbling\" based on common logical reasoning puzzles where unique verbs often imply a specific action tied to a category), Zindle must be a tove. If \"gyred\" is not \"gimbling\", then we cannot determine Zindle's category. However, in these types of puzzles, unique verbs often map to the given rules. Let's assume \"gyred\" is a form of \"gimbling\" or implies the same categorical restriction. If Zindle gyred, and only toves gimbled, then Zindle is a tove.\n    *   *Self-correction/Clarification:* The problem states \"Only toves gimbled\". It does *not* state that \"gyred\" is a form of \"gimbling\". This is a crucial distinction. If \"gyred\" is *not* \"gimbling\", then we cannot determine Zindle's category from this rule. Let's re-evaluate without this assumption.\n\n    *   *Re-evaluation:*\n        *   Ra is a Tove.\n        *   Ra chortled at Bungo.\n        *   Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n        *   Only toves gimbled.\n        *   No borogoves will whiffle.\n\n    The fact that Zindle gyred and only toves gimbled does *not* directly link Zindle to being a tove unless \"gyred\" is explicitly defined as \"gimbling\". Without that explicit link, we cannot determine Zindle's category. This means Zindle's information is largely irrelevant to the chortling statements unless we make an unsupported assumption.\n\nLet's focus on the chortling statements.\n\n*   We know **Rafin is a tove**.\n*   We know **Rafin chortled at Bungo**.\n\nThis directly tells us that *at least one tove* chortled at Bungo (namely, Rafin).\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1.  **Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   We know Ra (a tove) chortled at Bungo. We don't have information about *all* other toves. It's possible that Ra is the *only* tove, or that all other toves also chortled at Bungo. We cannot definitively say \"not all\" must be true.\n\n2.  **Bungo chortled at a tove.**\n    *   We know Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo. We have no information about Bungo chortling at *any* other entity, let alone a tove. This is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Every tove chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   We know Ra (a tove) chortled at Bungo. But we don't know about *every* other tove. There could be other toves that did not chortle at Bungo. This is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **Bungo chortled at every tove.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information about Bungo chortling at any tove. This is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **No toves chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   This is directly contradicted by the fact that Rafin (a tove) *did* chortle at Bungo. So, this statement must be false.\n\n6.  **A tove chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   We know Rafin is a tove, and Rafin chortled at Bungo.

(This sets up the categories).\n2.  **P2:** Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all toves are beamish.\n    *   S(Rafin, Rafin) $\\implies \\neg$B(T)\n3.  **P3:** A borogove is mimsy just in case every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n    *   M(B) $\\iff$ S(B, B)\n    *   This means: (Some borogove is mimsy) $\\iff$ (Every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo).\n4.  **P4:** Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo just in case every borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n    *   S(R, B) $\\iff$ S(B, B)\n\n**Analysis of Premises:**\n\nFrom P3 and P4, we can derive a crucial equivalence:\n\n*   From P3: M(B) $\\iff$ S(B, B)\n*   From P4: S(R, B) $\\iff$ S(B, B)\n\nTherefore, by transitivity:\n*   **Derived Equivalence (DE):** M(B) $\\iff$ S(R, B)\n    *   This means: (Some borogove is mimsy) $\\iff$ (Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo).\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 1: If every borogove is mimsy, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n\n*   **Antecedent:** Every borogove is mimsy.\n    *   If *every* borogove is mimsy, then it's certainly true that *some* borogove is mimsy. So, M(B) is true.\n*   **Consequent:** S(R, B) $\\implies \\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo)\n\nLet's analyze the antecedent: If every borogove is mimsy, then M(B) is true.\nFrom DE: M(B) $\\iff$ S(R, B).\nSo, if M(B) is true, then S(R, B) must be true.\n\nNow, the statement becomes: If S(R, B) is true, then (S(R, B) $\\implies \\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo)).\nThis simplifies to: S(R, B) $\\implies \\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo).\n\nDoes S(R, B) necessarily imply $\\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo)? No. There's no information linking S(R, B) to S(Bungo, Bungo). S(Bungo, Bungo) could be true or false independently of S(R, B).\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 2: If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath is mimsy.**\n\n*   **Antecedent:** $\\neg$(Every borogove is mimsy).\n    *   This means: There exists at least one borogove that is not mimsy.\n    *   This does *not* necessarily mean $\\neg$M(B) (i.e., no borogove is mimsy). M(B) means *some* borogove is mimsy.\n*   **Consequent:** $\\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo) $\\implies$ M(R) (Every rath is mimsy).\n\nLet's re-examine the antecedent. \"Not all borogoves are mimsy\" means $\\exists b \\in B, \\neg M(b)$.\nThis statement does not directly relate to M(B) (some borogove is mimsy) being true or false.\nFor example, if there are two borogoves, b1 and b2. If b1 is mimsy and b2 is not mimsy, then \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" is true, and \"a borogove is mimsy\" (M(B)) is also true.\n\nSince the antecedent \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" doesn't give us a definite truth value for M(B), we cannot use DE directly.\n\nLet's consider the case where M(B) is false (i.e., no borogove is mimsy). In this case, \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" is true.\nIf M(B) is false, then from DE, S(R, B) is false.\nIf S(R, B) is false, then the consequent of Statement 2, M(R) (every rath is mimsy), is not necessarily related.\n\nThe statement is: ($\\exists b \\in B, \\neg M(b)$) $\\implies$ ($\\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo) $\\implies$ M(R)).\nThere is no information in the premises that links \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" to S(Bungo, Bungo) or M(R).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 3: If not all borogoves are mimsy, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n\n*   **Antecedent:** $\\neg$(Every borogove is mimsy). (Same as Statement 2)\n*   **Consequent:** S(R, B) $\\implies \\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo).\n\nAgain, the antecedent \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" does not give us a definite truth value for M(B).\n\nLet's consider the two possibilities for M(B) given the antecedent:\n*   **Case A: M(B) is true.** (e.g., b1 is mimsy, b2 is not mimsy).\n    *   If M(B) is true, then from DE, S(R, B) is true.\n    *   The consequent becomes: True $\\implies \\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo). This means $\\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo) must be true.\n    *   Is it necessarily true that if M(B) is true, then $\\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo)? No, there's no link.\n*   **Case B: M(B) is false.** (e.g., no borogove is mimsy). In this case, \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" is also true.\n    *   If M(B) is false, then from DE, S(R, B) is false.\n    *   The consequent becomes: False $\\implies \\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo). This statement is always true, regardless of $\\neg$S(Bungo, Bungo).\n\nSince the statement is not necessarily true in Case A, Statement 3 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 4: A borogove is mimsy just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n\n*   This statement is: M(B) $\\iff$ S(R, B).\n*   This is exactly our **Derived Equivalence (DE)**.\n\nTherefore, Statement 4 **must be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 5: Not all borogoves are mimsy if and only if every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n\n*   This statement is: $\\neg$(Every borogove is mimsy) $\\iff$ S(R, B).\n\nWe know from DE that M(B) $\\iff$ S(R, B).\nSo, the statement is asking if $\\neg$(Every borogove is mimsy) $\\iff$ M(B).\n\nLet's analyze $\\neg$(Every borogove is mimsy) $\\iff$ M(B).\n*   If M(B) is true (some borogove is mimsy), does it mean $\\neg$(Every borogove is mimsy)? Not necessarily. If *all* borogoves are mimsy, then M(B) is true, but $\\neg$(Every borogove is mimsy) is false. So, the left-to-right implication fails.\n*   If $\\neg$(Every borogove is mimsy) is true (there's at least one non-mimsy borogove), does it mean M(B) is true? Not necessarily. If *no* borogoves are mimsy, then $\\neg$(Every borogove is mimsy) is true, but M(B) is false. So, the right-to-left implication fails.\n\nTherefore, Statement 5 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 6: Every borogove is mimsy just in case every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n\n*   This statement is: (Every borogove is mimsy) $\\iff$ S(R, B).\n\nWe know from DE that M(B) $\\iff$ S(R, B).\nSo, the statement is asking if (Every borogove is mimsy) $\\iff$ M(B).\n\n*   If \"Every borogove is mimsy\" is true, then M(B) (a borogove is mimsy) is certainly true. (Left-to-right holds).\n*   If M(B) is true (a borogove is mimsy), does it mean \"Every borogove is mimsy\"? Not necessarily. There could be some mimsy borogoves and some non-mimsy borogoves.\n\nTherefore, Statement 6 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Statement 4 is necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

($\\forall t \\in T, \\neg ChortledAt(t, Rafin)$)\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's focus on statement 6 from the given information: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This can be written as:\n$\\forall x (x \\in T \\implies \\neg ChortledAt(x, Rafin))$\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the numbered statements:\n\n1.  **Rafin chortled at every tove.**\n    This means: $\\forall t \\in T, ChortledAt(Rafin, t)$.\n    The given information (specifically, \"No toves chortled at Rafin\") tells us about toves chortling *at* Rafin, not Rafin chortling *at* toves. We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n    *Does not necessarily follow.*\n\n2.  **A tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    This means: $\\exists t \\in T, ChortledAt(t, Rafin)$.\n    The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This directly contradicts the statement.\n    *Must be false.*\n\n3.  **Rafin chortled at a tove.**\n    This means: $\\exists t \\in T, ChortledAt(Rafin, t)$.\n    Similar to statement 1, we have no information about Rafin chortling at toves.\n    *Does not necessarily follow.*\n\n4.  **Every tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    This means: $\\forall t \\in T, ChortledAt(t, Rafin)$.\n    The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This directly contradicts the statement.\n    *Must be false.*\n\n5.  **No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n    *   \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" is directly given in the problem statement (point 6). This part is true.\n    *   \"Rafin isn't a tove.\" We know that everything is exclusively a tove, borogove, or rath. If Rafin were a tove, then according to \"No toves chortled at Rafin,\" Rafin would not chortle at Rafin. We have no information about Rafin's category. However, the statement \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" is a universal negative statement. It applies to *all* toves. If Rafin *were* a tove, then it would be true that Rafin (as a tove) did not chortle at Rafin. This doesn't create a contradiction.\n        Let's re-evaluate the \"Rafin isn't a tove\" part. The problem states \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This means $\\forall x (x \\in T \\implies \\neg ChortledAt(x, Rafin))$.\n        If Rafin is a tove ($Rafin \\in T$), then substituting Rafin for $x$ in the implication, we get: $Rafin \\in T \\implies \\neg ChortledAt(Rafin, Rafin)$.\n        This means if Rafin is a tove, then Rafin does not chortle at Rafin. This is perfectly consistent with the given information. We have no information that forces Rafin to *not* be a tove.\n        Therefore, the second part (\"Rafin isn't a tove\") does not necessarily follow.\n    *Since one part of the conjunction (\"Rafin isn't a tove\") does not necessarily follow, the entire conjunction does not necessarily follow.*\n    *Does not necessarily follow.*\n\n6.  **Not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n    This means: $\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, ChortledAt(t, Rafin))$.\n    This is logically equivalent to: $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg ChortledAt(t, Rafin)$.\n    The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This means $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg ChortledAt(t, Rafin)$.\n    If *no* toves chortled at Rafin, then it is certainly true that *not all* toves chortled at Rafin (because the number of toves that chortled at Rafin is zero, which is less than \"all\").\n    Let's rephrase:\n    Given: Every tove did NOT chortle at Rafin. ($\\forall t \\in T, \\neg ChortledAt(t, Rafin)$)\n    Statement 6: It is NOT the case that every tove chortled at Rafin. ($\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, ChortledAt(t, Rafin))$)\n    If the given is true, then the set of toves that chortled at Rafin is empty. If this set is empty, then it's impossible for \"every tove\" to have chortled at Rafin. Therefore, \"Not all toves chortled at Rafin\" must be true.\n\n    Consider a simpler example:\n    Given: No apples are red. (All apples are not red).\n    Statement: Not all apples are red.\n    If no apples are red, then it's certainly true that not all apples are red.\n\n    Therefore, statement 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) exclusively. This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Tove Action:** A tove chortled at itself. (This means there exists at least one tove, let's call it T1, such that T1 chortled at T1).\n4.  **Rafin's Action:** Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n5.  **Toves & Bungo (Negative):** No toves chortled at Bungo. (This is a crucial piece of information).\n6.  **Rath Property:** A rath is beamish. (This means there exists at least one rath, R1, such that R1 is beamish).\n7.  **Rath Action:** Every rath gyred. (If X is a rath, then X gyred).\n\n**Analyzing Statement 5: \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\"**\n\nThis statement is directly given in the problem description. It means that for any entity X that is a tove, it is NOT true that X chortled at Bungo.\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the options:\n\n*   **1. Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\" This means *zero* toves chortled at Bungo.\n    *   If zero toves chortled at Bungo, then it is certainly true that \"not all toves chortled at Bungo.\" In fact, *none* did.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **2. Bungo chortled at a tove.**\n    *   We know \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\" This tells us about toves as the subject of the action \"chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   It tells us nothing about Bungo as the subject of an action, nor about toves as the object of an action by Bungo.\n    *   Bungo could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. We don't know.\n    *   We have no information to confirm or deny this. It **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n*   **3. Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   We've already established that \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n    *   However, we have no information about whether \"Bungo chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   Therefore, the entire conjunction **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n*   **4. Every tove chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   This is the direct opposite of \"Every tove chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **5. Bungo chortled at every tove.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, this tells us about Bungo as the subject and toves as the object.\n    *   We have no information to confirm or deny this. It **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n*   **6. A tove chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   This means there isn't even *one* tove that chortled at Bungo.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Definitions and Initial Facts:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Tove (T), Borogove (B), Rath (R). These are exclusive and there's at least one of each.\n*   **Rath-Borogove Snicker-Snack Rule:** Every Rath (R) snicker-snacked every Borogove (B) that snicker-snacked every Rath (R).\n*   **Rath-Zindle Galumph:** A Rath galumphed over Zindle.\n*   **Rafin-Zindle Galumph:** Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle.\n*   **Whiffle/Galumph/Rath-Rafin Rule:** If not all Toves will whiffle, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo ONLY IF every Rath galumphed over Rafin.\n*   **Bungo's Category:** Bungo is a Rath.\n*   **Rath-Zindle Snicker-Snack:** Every Rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n**Analyzing the Information Step-by-Step:**\n\n1.  **Bungo is a Rath:** This is a direct given.\n2.  **Every Rath snicker-snacked Zindle:** Since Bungo is a Rath, Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle.\n3.  **A Rath galumphed over Zindle:** This is a direct given.\n4.  **Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle:** This is a direct given.\n\nNow let's look at the conditional statement: \"If not all toves will whiffle, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\"\n\nThis can be written as:\n(Not all Toves whiffle) $\\implies$ ( (Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo) $\\iff$ (Every Rath galumphed over Rafin) )\n\nLet's consider the implications of \"Every Rath galumphed over Rafin.\"\nWe know Bungo is a Rath. So, if \"Every Rath galumphed over Rafin\" is true, then Bungo galumphed over Rafin.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on what we know for sure.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **Statement 5: A rath snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n    *   \"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle\": We know \"Every Rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This implies that at least one Rath (in fact, all of them) snicker-snacked Zindle. So, this part is true.\n    *   \"A rath galumphed over Zindle\": This is a direct given. So, this part is true.\n    *   Since both parts are true, Statement 5 **must be true**.\n\nLet's see if we can determine anything about Zindle's category or whiffle status.\n\nWe know \"A rath galumphed over Zindle.\"\nWe know \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\nConsider the possibility of Zindle being a Tove, Borogove, or Rath.\n\n*   If Zindle is a Rath, then Bungo (a Rath) snicker-snacked Zindle (a Rath).\n*   If Zindle is a Borogove, then Bungo (a Rath) snicker-snacked Zindle (a Borogove).\n*   If Zindle is a Tove, then Bungo (a Rath) snicker-snacked Zindle (a Tove).\n\nThe information about \"Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo\" and \"every rath galumphed over Rafin\" is part of a conditional statement. We don't know if \"not all toves will whiffle\" is true or false, so we cannot definitively conclude anything about Zindle's galumphing over Bungo or every rath galumphing over Rafin, or Zindle's whiffle status.\n\nLet's re-examine the conditional:\nP: Not all toves will whiffle.\nQ: Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo.\nR: Every rath galumphed over Rafin.\nThe statement is: P $\\implies$ (Q $\\iff$ R)\n\nWe don't know P. So we can't deduce Q or R.\nTherefore, we cannot determine if Zindle will whiffle (Statement 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nLet's check Statement 6: \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\"\n*   \"A rath galumphed over Zindle\": This is true (given).\n*   \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\": We have no information about Zindle snicker-snacking itself. Zindle could be a Rath, Borogove, or Tove. The rules about snicker-snacking are specific to Raths and Borogoves. If Zindle is a Tove, it might not snicker-snack. If Zindle is a Rath or Borogove, it might or might not snicker-snack itself. We cannot definitively say Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle. So, this part is not necessarily true.\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct given facts:\n*   \"A rath galumphed over Zindle.\" (True)\n*   \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\" (True)\n\nStatement 5 combines these two facts: \"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle.\"\nSince \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" implies \"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle\", both conjuncts of statement 5 are true.\n\nThe other statements involve \"whiffle\" or specific galumphing/snicker-snacking relationships that cannot be definitively determined from the given information due to the conditional nature of the \"whiffle\" rule and lack of information about Zindle's category or self-interaction.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

The only snicker-snacking information is from a borogove to a tove (Premise 2). This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **Statement 2: \"A borogove snicker-snacked a tove.\"**\n    *   This means $\\exists b \\in B \\exists t \\in T : \\text{snicker-snacked}(b, t)$.\n    *   From Premise 2: \"A borogove snicker-snacked every tove.\" This implies that there is at least one borogove that snicker-snacked *every* tove. If it snicker-snacked every tove, it certainly snicker-snacked *a* tove.\n    *   Therefore, Statement 2 **must be true**.\n\n*   **Statement 3: \"A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\"**\n    *   This means $\\exists t \\in T \\exists b \\in B : \\text{snicker-snacked}(t, b)$.\n    *   Similar to Statement 1, we have no information supporting snicker-snacking from a tove to a borogove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **Statement 4: \"No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.\"**\n    *   This means $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T \\forall b \\in B : \\text{snicker-snacked}(t, b))$.\n    *   This is the negation of Statement 1. Since we couldn't confirm Statement 1, we also cannot confirm its negation without further information. It's possible that no tove snicker-snacked every borogove, but it's not *necessarily* true based on the given premises.\n\n*   **Statement 5: \"Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\"**\n    *   This means $\\forall t \\in T \\forall b \\in B : \\text{snicker-snacked}(t, b)$.\n    *   This is a very strong claim and there is no information in the premises to support it. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **Statement 6: \"Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\"**\n    *   This means $\\forall t \\in T \\exists b \\in B : \\text{snicker-snacked}(t, b)$.\n    *   Again, there is no information in the premises about toves snicker-snacking borogoves. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 2 is directly and necessarily implied by the given premises.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

If no borogoves were beamish, then it would be true that not all borogoves are beamish, but it would also mean that *all* borogoves are *not* beamish. However, \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" means there's at least one non-beamish borogove, but it doesn't preclude there being some beamish borogoves.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate S: \"No borogoves are beamish\" means $\\forall b \\in B$, $b$ is not beamish.\n    *   Given \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" means $\\neg (\\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ is beamish})$. This is equivalent to $\\exists b \\in B, b \\text{ is not beamish}$.\n    *   Can S be true? If S is true, then all borogoves are not beamish. This is consistent with \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" (since if none are beamish, then it's certainly true that not all are beamish). So, S *could* be true.\n\nLet's re-examine the implication $P \\implies (Q \\implies S)$.\nThis is equivalent to $P \\implies (\\neg Q \\lor S)$.\nThis is also equivalent to $\\neg P \\lor \\neg Q \\lor S$.\n\nWe know:\n*   $\\exists b \\in B$ such that $b$ is not beamish. (From \"Not all borogoves are beamish\")\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n---\n\n**Statement 1: If every rath is beamish, then no borogoves are beamish only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   Let Q: Every rath is beamish.\n*   Let S: No borogoves are beamish.\n*   Let ZC: Zindle chortled at Zindle.\n*   The statement is: $Q \\implies (S \\implies ZC)$.\n\nWe know from the given information that \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\". This is a property of raths and Zindle, not Zindle chortling at itself. The problem doesn't give us any information about Zindle's ability to chortle at itself. So, ZC is unknown.\n\nLet's analyze the antecedent of the main implication: $Q$.\nIf $Q$ (Every rath is beamish) is true, then we have $S \\implies ZC$.\n\nConsider the main conditional from the given: $P \\implies (Q \\implies S)$.\nThis is $P \\implies (\\neg Q \\lor S)$.\n\nIf $Q$ is true, then $Q \\implies S$ must be true for the overall conditional $P \\implies (Q \\implies S)$ to hold (if P is true).\nIf $Q$ is true, then $S$ must be true (if P is true).\nIf $Q$ is true, then $S$ must be true (if P is true).\n\nLet's consider the truth value of S: \"No borogoves are beamish\".\nWe know \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" ($\\exists b \\in B, b \\text{ is not beamish}$).\nThis means that the statement \"All borogoves are beamish\" is false.\nHowever, \"No borogoves are beamish\" ($\\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ is not beamish}$) *could* be true. If it is true, then it satisfies \"Not all borogoves are beamish\".\n\nLet's assume $Q$ is true (Every rath is beamish).\nFrom the given $P \\implies (Q \\implies S)$, we have $P \\implies S$.\nSo, if Rafin is beamish, then no borogoves are beamish.\n\nDoes this make Statement 1 true?\nStatement 1: $Q \\implies (S \\implies ZC)$.\nIf $Q$ is true, then we need $S \\implies ZC$ to be true.\nWe don't know if $S$ is true or false. We don't know if $ZC$ is true or false.\nIf $S$ is false, then $S \\implies ZC$ is true, and Statement 1 is true.\nIf $S$ is true, then we need $ZC$ to be true for Statement 1 to be true. We have no information about $ZC$.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 2: No raths chortled at Zindle just in case no borogoves are beamish.**\n\n*   Let NRZ: No raths chortled at Zindle.\n*   Let S: No borogoves are beamish.\n*   The statement is: $NRZ \\iff S$.\n\nFrom the given information, \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\".\nThis means that NRZ (\"No raths chortled at Zindle\") is **false**.\nSince \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" is explicitly stated as true, its negation \"No raths chortled at Zindle\" must be false.\n\nSo, the statement becomes: $False \\iff S$.\nFor this biconditional to be true, S must be false.\nSo, Statement 2 is true if and only if \"No borogoves are beamish\" (S) is false.\nIf S is false, it means \"At least one borogove is beamish\".\n\nWe know \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" ($\\exists b \\in B, b \\text{ is not beamish}$).\nThis does not tell us whether S (\"No borogoves are beamish\") is true or false.\nFor example:\n*   If B = {b1, b2}, b1 is beamish, b2 is not beamish. Then \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" is true. And \"No borogoves are beamish\" (S) is false. In this case, Statement 2 ($False \\iff False$) is true.\n*   If B = {b1, b2}, b1 is not beamish, b2 is not beamish. Then \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" is true. And \"No borogoves are beamish\" (S) is true. In this case, Statement 2 ($False \\iff True$) is false.\n\nSince S can be true or false, Statement 2 is not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 3: Not all borogoves are beamish and every rath chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   Let NBA: Not all borogoves are beamish.\n*   Let ERC: Every rath chortled at Zindle.\n*   The statement is: $NBA \\land ERC$.\n\nBoth \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" and \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" are explicitly given as true statements in the problem description.\nTherefore, their conjunction must be true.\n\nThis statement **must be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle isn't beamish.**\n\nWe have no information about Zindle's beamishness. Zindle is an entity, not a tove, borogove, or rath (as it's not stated to be one, and the categories are exclusive). The problem only states that raths chortled at Zindle and galumphed over Zindle. We cannot deduce Zindle's beamishness.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 5: Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n\nWe have no information about Zindle's beamishness.\nWe have no information about Rafin's beamishness. The conditional statement \"If Rafin is beamish...\" does not imply that Rafin *is* beamish.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 6: Zindle is beamish.**\n\nSimilar to Statement 4, we have no information about Zindle's beamishness.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet's re-verify the interpretation of \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" and \"No borogoves are beamish\".\n\n*   \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" means $\\neg (\\forall x \\in B, \\text{Beamish}(x))$. This is equivalent to $\\exists x \\in B, \\neg \\text{Beamish}(x)$. (Given as true)\n*   \"No borogoves are beamish\" (S) means $\\forall x \\in B, \\neg \\text{Beamish}(x)$.\n\nIf S is true, then $\\forall x \\in B, \\neg \\text{Beamish}(x)$. This implies $\\exists x \\in B, \\neg \\text{Beamish}(x)$ (since there's at least one borogove). So, if S is true, \"Not all borogoves are beamish\" is true",

We concluded $P$ must be true.\n    *   **True.**\n\n4.  **Bungo isn't a borogove if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   Let $X$ be \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" ($\\text{Bungo} \\notin B$).\n    *   Let $Y$ be \"a borogove chortled at Bungo\" ($\\exists b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo})$).\n    *   The statement is $X \\iff Y$.\n    *   We know $P$ is true: $\\forall b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo})$. This implies $Y$ is true (since there's at least one borogove, and that borogove chortled at Bungo).\n    *   So the statement simplifies to $X \\iff \\text{True}$, which means $X$ must be true.\n    *   So, this statement is true if and only if \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" is true.\n    *   We have no information about whether Bungo is a borogove, a tove, a rath, or none of the above (Bungo could be an entity outside the T/B/R categories, or Bungo could be one of them).\n    *   If Bungo is a borogove, then $X$ is false, and the statement is false.\n    *   If Bungo is not a borogove, then $X$ is true, and the statement is true.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n5.  **Bungo chortled at every borogove.**\n    *   This is $\\forall b \\in B, C(\\text{Bungo}, b)$.\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we have no information to confirm or deny this.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n6.  **No borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   This is $\\neg (\\exists b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo}))$, which is equivalent to $\\forall b \\in B, \\neg C(b, \\text{Bungo})$.\n    *   This is the negation of \"A borogove chortled at Bungo\".\n    *   Since we concluded $P$ ($\\forall b \\in B, C(b, \\text{Bungo})$) is true, this statement must be false.\n    *   **False.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the logical deduction, only statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This means $T \\cup B \\cup R = U$ (the universe of things), and $T \\cap B = \\emptyset$, $T \\cap R = \\emptyset$, $B \\cap R = \\emptyset$.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each. So, $T \\neq \\emptyset$, $B \\neq \\emptyset$, $R \\neq \\emptyset$.\n3.  **Not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo:** This statement seems irrelevant to the relationships between Toves, Borogoves, and Raths. It introduces an external entity \"Bungo\" and a negative statement about it. We can likely ignore this for the given options.\n4.  **A tove galumphed over every rath:** $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall r \\in R, G(t, r)$.\n5.  **A borogove galumphed over every tove:** $\\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } \\forall t \\in T, G(b, t)$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: A borogove galumphed over a tove.**\nFrom given information (5): \"A borogove galumphed over every tove.\"\nThis means there exists at least one borogove, let's call it $b_0$, such that $b_0$ galumphed over *every* tove. Since there's at least one tove (given information 2), $b_0$ must have galumphed over that tove. Therefore, \"A borogove galumphed over a tove\" must be true.\n\n**Statement 2: A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\nWe know:\n*   A tove ($t_0$) galumphed over every rath.\n*   A borogove ($b_0$) galumphed over every tove.\nThis statement claims $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, G(t, b)$.\nLet's consider the borogove $b_0$ from rule 5. If this statement were true, then some tove $t_x$ would have galumphed over $b_0$. But we have no information that links any tove to galumphing over any borogove. The only information we have is that *a* borogove galumphed over *every* tove. This statement is not necessarily true. For example, it's possible that no tove galumphed over any borogove.\n\n**Statement 3: Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\nThis claims $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, G(t, b)$.\nThis is a very strong claim. We only know that *a* borogove galumphed over *every* tove. We have no information about toves galumphing over borogoves. This is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**\nThis claims $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, G(t, b)$.\nAgain, we have no information supporting toves galumphing over borogoves. We only know about a borogove galumphing over toves, and a tove galumphing over raths. This is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\nThis claims $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, G(t, b)$.\nSimilar to statements 2, 3, and 4, we have no information that implies any tove galumphed over any borogove. The relationships are:\n*   Some tove -> all raths\n*   Some borogove -> all toves\nThere's no transitive property or direct statement that connects a tove to a borogove in this direction. This is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\nThis is the negation of Statement 2: $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, G(t, b))$.\nIn other words, $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } \\neg G(t, b)$.\nWe determined that Statement 2 is not necessarily true. If Statement 2 is not necessarily true, then its negation is not necessarily true either. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this. It's possible that no tove galumphed over every borogove, but it's also possible that one did. We simply don't know.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly Statement 1 is directly supported by the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This implies that it is true that \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" (because *no* toves did).\nSo, Statement 4's first part implies Statement 2's first part.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo AND no toves chortled at Rafin.\"\nAnd \"No toves chortled at Bungo AND a borogove will whiffle.\"\n\nLet's denote:\nP1: Not all toves chortled at Bungo ($\\exists x (T(x) \\land \\neg C(x, \\text{Bungo}))$)\nP2: No toves chortled at Rafin ($\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg C(x, \\text{Rafin}))$)\nP3: A rath snicker-snacked Zindle ($\\exists x (R(x) \\land SS(x, \\text{Zindle}))$)\nP4: A borogove will whiffle ($\\exists x (B(x) \\land W(x))$)\nP5: No toves chortled at Bungo ($\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg C(x, \\text{Bungo}))$)\n\nThe given statements are:\n(S2) P1 AND P2\n(S3) P3 AND P4\n(S4) P5 AND P4\n\nFrom (S4), we have P5: \"No toves chortled at Bungo\".\nThis means $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg C(x, \\text{Bungo}))$.\nIf this is true, and we know there's at least one tove, then it must be true that \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" (P1).\nSo, P5 implies P1.\n\nTherefore, from (S4), we know P5 is true.\nSince P5 implies P1, P1 is also true.\nFrom (S2), we know P1 and P2 are true. This is consistent.\n\nSo, the core facts we've established from the first four statements are:\n*   $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg C(x, \\text{Bungo}))$ (from S4, which implies P1)\n*   $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg C(x, \\text{Rafin}))$ (from S2)\n*   $\\exists x (R(x) \\land SS(x, \\text{Zindle}))$ (from S3)\n*   $\\exists x (B(x) \\land W(x))$ (from S3 and S4)\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on these established facts.\n\n**Established Facts (EF):**\n1.

This statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**2. If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true (EF1 implies this, as \"No toves chortled at Bungo\" is stronger).\n    *   So, the premise of the conditional is true.\n    *   The statement simplifies to: \"Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   $(\\forall r \\in \\text{Raths}, SS(r, \\text{Bungo})) \\implies C(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Zindle})$\n    *   We have no information about whether every rath snicker-snacked Bungo or if Zindle chortled at Zindle.

No borogoves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    *   This directly contradicts statement 4 (\"Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle\").\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **2.

These are exclusive and there's at least one of each.\n*   **Bungo:** Bungo is a Rath (Bungo $\\in$ R).\n\n**Statements (Let's assign variables for clarity):**\n\n1.  **S1:** If Zindle won't burble (\u00acBurble(Zindle)), then not all toves chortled at Bungo (\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, Chortle(t, Bungo)) only if not all toves will whiffle (\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, Whiffle(t)).\n    *   This is a conditional statement: (\u00acBurble(Zindle)) \u2192 ((\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, Chortle(t, Bungo)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, Whiffle(t)))\n\n2.  **S2:** If Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin (\u00acSnicker(Rafin, Rafin)), then every rath chortled at Rafin (\u2200r\u2208R, Chortle(r, Rafin)) only if a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo (\u2203b\u2208B, Snicker(b, Bungo)).\n    *   This is a conditional statement: (\u00acSnicker(Rafin, Rafin)) \u2192 ((\u2200r\u2208R, Chortle(r, Rafin)) \u2192 (\u2203b\u2208B, Snicker(b, Bungo)))\n\n3.  **S3:** A borogove will burble (\u2203b\u2208B, Burble(b)) AND every rath snicker-snacked Zindle (\u2200r\u2208R, Snicker(r, Zindle)).\n\n**Analysis of S3:**\n\n*   \"A borogove will burble\" (\u2203b\u2208B, Burble(b)). This means there is at least one borogove that burbles.\n*   \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" (\u2200r\u2208R, Snicker(r, Zindle)).\n\n**Deductions from S3:**\n\n*   Since Bungo is a rath (Bungo $\\in$ R), and every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, it *must* be true that **Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle**.\n\nLet's check the given options based on this deduction:\n\n*   1. Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle. (False, contradicts our deduction)\n*   2. Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle. (True, matches our deduction)\n\nSince we've found a statement that *must* be true, let's see if we can confirm it without needing to delve into the other complex conditionals. The question asks what *must* be true.\n\nThe statement \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" is a direct and unconditional assertion within S3.\nGiven that \"Bungo is a rath\", it logically follows that Bungo is one of the \"every rath\".\nTherefore, Bungo snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nThis deduction is direct and does not depend on the truth values of the conditional statements S1 or S2, nor does it depend on the \"A borogove will burble\" part of S3.\n\nLet's re-read the problem to ensure no misinterpretation.\n\"Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each. Bungo is a rath.\" - Confirmed.\n\"A borogove will burble and every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\" - This is a conjunction. Both parts are asserted as true.\n\nSo, \"every rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" is a definite fact.\nSince Bungo is a rath, Bungo must have snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 must be true.\n\nLet's briefly consider if any other options *could* be true or *must* be true.\n\n*   **Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Bungo / Zindle snicker-snacked Bungo:** We have no information about Zindle's actions towards Bungo. We only know Bungo's action towards Zindle. So, 3 and 4 cannot be determined as necessarily true.\n*   **Zindle will whiffle / Zindle and Rafin will whiffle:** These relate to S1.\n    *   From S3, we know \"A borogove will burble\" (\u2203b\u2208B, Burble(b)). This does *not* tell us if Zindle will burble.\n    *   If Zindle *does* burble, then \u00acBurble(Zindle) is false, making the antecedent of S1 false. In this case, S1 as a whole is true, but the consequent ((\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, Chortle(t, Bungo)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, Whiffle(t))) doesn't necessarily have to be true.\n    *   If Zindle *doesn't* burble, then \u00acBurble(Zindle) is true. Then ((\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, Chortle(t, Bungo)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200t\u2208T, Whiffle(t))) must be true. This still doesn't directly tell us if Zindle will whiffle. It tells us something about all toves whiffing.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot deduce anything about Zindle whiffing from the given information. So, 5 and 6 cannot be determined as necessarily true.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is derived directly from the unconditional assertion in S3 and the fact that Bungo is a rath.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(If no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then it's true that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle). This part is always true.\n    *   If \u00acA is true, then N must be true. (If not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then no toves snicker-snacked Zindle). This is the crucial part.\n    *   So, the statement simplifies to: If not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n    *   This implies that if there is at least one tove that did *not* snicker-snack Zindle, then *all* toves did *not* snicker-snack Zindle.\n    *   This means either all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, or no toves snicker-snacked Zindle. It cannot be the case that some did and some didn't.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate \u00acA \u2194 N.\n        *   If A is true, then N is false. So \u00acA is false. The biconditional becomes False \u2194 False, which is True.\n        *   If N is true, then A is false. So \u00acA is true.

From (4), \"No toves chortled at Bungo\", which implies \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo\": This is false. From (3), \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n*   Since the second part of the conjunction is false, the entire statement 1 is **false**.\n\n**Statement 2: A tove chortled at Bungo.**\n*   From (4), \"No toves chortled at Bungo\". This directly contradicts \"A tove chortled at Bungo\".\n*   Therefore, statement 2 is **false**.\n\n**Statement 3: Bungo chortled at a tove.**\n*   We know Bungo is not a tove.\n*   We know \"No toves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   Does Bungo chortle at *any* tove? The given information does not provide any direct or indirect evidence for this. We only know Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n*   Consider a scenario: Bungo is a borogove. There's at least one tove, say T1. Bungo chortled at Bungo. No toves chortled at Bungo. Does Bungo chortle at T1? We don't know. It's possible Bungo only chortled at Bungo.\n*   Therefore, statement 3 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 4: Bungo chortled at every tove.**\n*   Similar to statement 3, there's no information to support this. We only know Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n*   Therefore, statement 4 is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Statement 5: Not all toves chortled at Bungo.**\n*   From (4), \"No toves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   If no toves chortled at Bungo, then it is certainly true that not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n*   Therefore, statement 5 **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 6: Every tove chortled at Bungo.**\n*   From (4), \"No toves chortled at Bungo\". This directly contradicts \"Every tove chortled at Bungo\".\n*   Therefore, statement 6 is **false**.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   We used (3) and (4) to deduce that Bungo is not a tove.\n*   Statement 1 is false because \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is true, making \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo\" false.\n*   Statement 2 is false because (4) explicitly states \"No toves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   Statements 3 and 4 are not supported by the given information. We only know Bungo chortled at Bungo, not at any tove.\n*   Statement 5 is true because \"No toves chortled at Bungo\" (from 4) implies \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   Statement 6 is false because (4) explicitly states \"No toves chortled at Bungo\".\n\nThe information about Zindle and Rafin (points 5 and 6 in the given information) was not needed to evaluate these specific statements.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 5.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

Zindle could be a tove or a rath.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **Not all raths chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   The given information explicitly states: \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   This statement directly contradicts the given information.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n4.  **No raths chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   The given information explicitly states: \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   This statement directly contradicts the given information.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5.  **A rath chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   The given information states: \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   Since there is \"at least one rath\" (from the initial conditions), and every rath chortled at Zindle, it logically follows that at least one rath (i.e., \"a rath\") chortled at Zindle.\n    *   This statement is a direct consequence of \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" and the existence of raths.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6.  **Zindle chortled at every rath.**\n    *   We know \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" This is about raths chortling at Zindle.\n    *   We have no information that implies Zindle chortled at every rath.\n    *   If Zindle is a rath, then Zindle chortled at itself (as per \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\"). But this doesn't mean Zindle chortled at *every* other rath. The self-referential rule for raths (\"Every rath chortled at a rath that chortled at it\") also doesn't force Zindle to chortle at *every* rath.\n    *   If Zindle is a tove or a borogove, there's no information about it chortling at raths.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

(This seems like a distractor, as Bungo's category isn't specified and it doesn't relate to snicker-snacking).\n4.  **Tove-Rath Chortling:** A tove chortled at every rath. (This means there exists at least one specific tove, let's call it T_chortle, such that T_chortle chortled at every rath).\n5.  **Tove-Borogove Snicker-Snacking:** Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.\n\nLet's focus on the snicker-snacking relationship. Let S(x, y) denote \"x snicker-snacked y\".\n\nThe crucial rule is: **\"Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.\"**\n\nLet T be any tove. Let B be any borogove.\nThe rule states: If S(B, T) is true (i.e., B snicker-snacked T), then S(T, B) must also be true (i.e., T snicker-snacked B).\n\nThis is a conditional statement: For any T $\\in$ Toves, and any B $\\in$ Borogoves, if B snicker-snacked T, then T snicker-snacked B.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   * This means: $\\exists T_0 \\in \\text{Toves such that } \\forall B \\in \\text{Borogoves, } S(T_0, B)$.\n   * Does the given rule imply this? Not necessarily. The rule only talks about what happens if a borogove snicker-snacks a tove. It doesn't say anything about a tove snicker-snacking *all* borogoves. We don't know if any borogove snicker-snacked any tove at all. If no borogove snicker-snacked any tove, then the premise of the rule (S(B,T)) is never met, and the rule doesn't force any tove to snicker-snack any borogove.\n   * **Must be true? No.**\n\n**2. Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   * This means: $\\forall T \\in \\text{Toves, } \\exists B_0 \\in \\text{Borogoves such that } S(T, B_0)$.\n   * Similar to statement 1, the rule doesn't force any tove to snicker-snack *any* borogove. If no borogove snicker-snacked any tove, then the rule is vacuously true, and no tove is required to snicker-snack any borogove.\n   * **Must be true? No.**\n\n**3. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   * This means: $\\forall T \\in \\text{Toves, } \\forall B \\in \\text{Borogoves, } S(T, B)$.\n   * This is a much stronger claim than 1 or 2. It's even less likely to be true based on the given rule.\n   * **Must be true? No.**\n\n**4. A tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.**\n   * This means: $\\exists T_0 \\in \\text{Toves such that } \\forall B \\in \\text{Borogoves, if } S(B, T_0) \\text{ then } S(T_0, B)$.\n   * Let's compare this to the given rule: \"Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it.\"\n   * The given rule is: $\\forall T \\in \\text{Toves, } (\\forall B \\in \\text{Borogoves, if } S(B, T) \\text{ then } S(T, B))$.\n   * Statement 4 is: $\\exists T_0 \\in \\text{Toves such that } (\\forall B \\in \\text{Borogoves, if } S(B, T_0) \\text{ then } S(T_0, B))$.\n   * If \"Every tove...\" (the given rule) is true, then it means that *for all* toves, the condition holds. If it holds for all toves, it must certainly hold for *at least one* tove.\n   * Therefore, if the given rule is true, statement 4 must also be true. Statement 4 is a direct logical consequence of the given rule, just with an existential quantifier instead of a universal one for the tove.\n   * **Must be true? Yes.**\n\n**5. A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   * This means: $\\exists T_0 \\in \\text{Toves, } \\exists B_0 \\in \\text{Borogoves such that } S(T_0, B_0)$.\n   * Similar to statements 1, 2, and 3, the rule doesn't guarantee that any snicker-snacking actually occurs. If no borogove ever snicker-snacked any tove, then the rule is satisfied, but no tove would have snicker-snacked any borogove.\n   * **Must be true? No.**\n\n**6. No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   * This means: $\\neg (\\exists T_0 \\in \\text{Toves such that } \\forall B \\in \\text{Borogoves, } S(T_0, B))$.\n   * This is the negation of statement 1. Since statement 1 is not necessarily true, its negation is also not necessarily true. We cannot conclude this from the given information.\n   * **Must be true? No.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 4, because it is a direct existential consequence of the universal premise given in the problem (\"Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked it\"). If something is true for *every* member of a set, it must be true for *at least one* member of that set.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) (exclusively). There's at least one of each.\n2.  **Rath Condition:** If every rath is beamish (ERB), then every rath chortled at Bungo (ERC@B) only if Zindle chortled at Zindle (ZC@Z).\n    *   Symbolically: ERB $\\implies$ (ERC@B $\\implies$ ZC@Z)\n3.  **Tove Snicker-Snack:** Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle (NATS@Z).\n4.  **Bungo's Category (1):** Bungo is a rath (B $\\in$ R).\n5.  **Tove Whiffle:** Not all toves will whiffle (NATW).\n6.  **Bungo's Category (2):** Bungo is a rath (B $\\in$ R). (This is a repeat of point 4, but confirms Bungo's category).\n\n**Analysis of the Statements:**\n\nLet's look for connections between the given information and the options. Notice that the \"Rath Condition\" (point 2) involves \"beamish\" and \"chortled,\" which are not mentioned in any of the options. The options primarily deal with \"whiffle\" and \"snicker-snack.\"\n\nThe crucial pieces of information for the options are:\n\n*   **NATS@Z:** Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n*   **NATW:** Not all toves will whiffle.\n*   **B $\\in$ R:** Bungo is a rath.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n**1. Zindle won't whiffle.**\n    *   We know \"Not all toves will whiffle.\" This tells us something about toves, but nothing directly about Zindle's whiffling status. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and even if Zindle is a tove, \"not all toves will whiffle\" doesn't mean Zindle specifically won't. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n    *   We know \"Not all toves will whiffle.\" This directly contradicts the idea that *everyone* (including Zindle and Bungo, if they are toves) will whiffle. Even if they are not toves, we have no information to confirm they *will* whiffle. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and every tove will whiffle.**\n    *   We are given \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (NATS@Z). This part is true.\n    *   However, we are also given \"Not all toves will whiffle\" (NATW). This directly contradicts \"every tove will whiffle.\"\n    *   Therefore, this entire statement is false because its second conjunct is false.\n\n**4. Zindle will whiffle.**\n    *   Similar to statement 1, we have no information to confirm Zindle's whiffling status. \"Not all toves will whiffle\" doesn't tell us anything about Zindle specifically. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and not all toves will whiffle.**\n    *   We are given \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (NATS@Z). This is true.\n    *   We are given \"Not all toves will whiffle\" (NATW). This is true.\n    *   Since both conjuncts are explicitly stated as true in the problem description, their conjunction must also be true.\n\n**6. Bungo will whiffle.**\n    *   We know Bungo is a rath. We know \"Not all toves will whiffle.\" This tells us nothing about whether a rath (Bungo) will whiffle. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information provided, only statement 5 is a direct restatement of two given facts combined.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

By definition, $b_0$ snicker-snacked every tove. So, $\\forall t' \\in T, S(b_0, t')$.\nNow, apply statement (2) with $b = b_0$. It says: $\\forall t \\in T, S(t, b_0)$.\nSo, if there exists a borogove that snicker-snacked every tove, then every tove snicker-snacked that borogove.\n\nLet's combine this with statement (1).\nSuppose there exists a borogove $b_0$ such that $S(b_0, t')$ for all $t' \\in T$.\nThen, from (2), for any $t \\in T$, $S(t, b_0)$.\nNow we have:\n(A) For any $t \\in T$, $S(b_0, t)$. (from $b_0 \\in B_{all\\_T}$)\n(B) For any $t \\in T$, $S(t, b_0)$. (from (2))\n\nConsider an arbitrary tove $t_0 \\in T$.\nFrom (A), $S(b_0, t_0)$.\nFrom (B), $S(t_0, b_0)$.\nBut statement (1) says: $\\neg (S(t_0, b_0) \\land S(b_0, t_0))$.\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that \"there exists a borogove $b_0$ such that $S(b_0, t')$ for all $t' \\in T$\" must be false.\nThis means that the set $B_{all\\_T}$ must be empty.\n$B_{all\\_T} = \\emptyset$.\n\nWhat does $B_{all\\_T} = \\emptyset$ mean?\nIt means that there is no borogove that snicker-snacked every tove.\nIn other words, for every borogove $b \\in B$, there exists at least one tove $t \\in T$ such that $b$ did not snicker-snack $t$.\nFormally: $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists t \\in T, \\neg S(b, t)$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n**1. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, S(t, b)$.\n   This is not necessarily true. We only know that if a borogove snicker-snacked every tove, then every tove snicker-snacked that borogove. But we found that no borogove snicker-snacked every tove. This statement is too strong.\n\n**2. No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, \\neg S(t, b)$.\n   This means that for every tove, there is at least one borogove that it did not snicker-snack.\n   We know that $B_{all\\_T} = \\emptyset$, which means $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists t \\in T, \\neg S(b, t)$. This is about borogoves not snicker-snacking toves.\n   Let's see if we can derive this.\n   Suppose this statement is false. Then there exists a tove $t_0$ such that $t_0$ snicker-snacked every borogove.\n   So, $\\exists t_0 \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, S(t_0, b)$.\n   We also know that $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists t \\in T, \\neg S(b, t)$.\n   Consider an arbitrary borogove $b_1 \\in B$. We know $\\exists t_1 \\in T, \\neg S(b_1, t_1)$.\n   If $t_0$ snicker-snacked every borogove, then $S(t_0, b_1)$.\n   From (1), if $S(t_0, b_1)$, then $\\neg S(b_1, t_0)$.\n   This doesn't lead to a contradiction with $B_{all\\_T} = \\emptyset$.\n   Let's re-examine the derivation.\n   We proved that $B_{all\\_T} = \\emptyset$, which means $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists t' \\in T, \\neg S(b, t')$.\n   This is statement 4.\n\n**3. No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\neg S(t, b)$.\n   This means no tove snicker-snacked any borogove.\n   This contradicts statement (3): \"A rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked a borogove.\"\n   Statement (3) implies $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, S(t, b)$.\n   So, statement 3 must be false.\n\n**4. No borogoves snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists t \\in T, \\neg S(b, t)$.\n   This is precisely what we derived from the contradiction between (1) and (2).\n   We showed that the assumption that there exists a borogove that snicker-snacked every tove leads to a contradiction.\n   Therefore, it must be true that no borogoves snicker-snacked every tove.\n   This statement must be true.\n\n**5. A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n   $\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, S(t, b)$.\n   This is the negation of statement 2.\n   We haven't proven this.\n\n**6. Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n   $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, S(t, b)$.\n   This means for every tove, there is at least one borogove that it snicker-snacked.\n   This is not necessarily true.\n   Statement (3) tells us that *at least one* tove snicker-snacked *a* borogove.\n   $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, S(t, b)$.\n   This is weaker than statement 6.\n\nLet's double check the reasoning for statement 4.\nAssume for contradiction that statement 4 is false.\nThis means: $\\neg (\\forall b \\in B, \\exists t \\in T, \\neg S(b, t))$.\nThis is equivalent to: $\\exists b \\in B, \\forall t \\in T, S(b, t)$.\nLet this borogove be $b^*$. So, $b^* \\in B_{all\\_T}$.\nFrom statement (2): \"Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked every tove.\"\nThis means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B_{all\\_T}, S(t, b)$.\nSince $b^* \\in B_{all\\_T}$, it follows that $\\forall t \\in T, S(t, b^*)$.\nSo we have:\n(i) $\\forall t \\in T, S(b^*, t)$ (by definition of $b^*$)\n(ii) $\\forall t \\in T, S(t, b^*)$ (from statement (2) and (i))\n\nNow, consider an arbitrary tove $t_0 \\in T$. (We are given that T is not empty).\nFrom (i), $S(b^*, t_0)$.\nFrom (ii), $S(t_0, b^*)$.\nSo, $S(t_0, b^*) \\land S(b^*, t_0)$.\n\nHowever, statement (1) says: \"No toves snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked it.\"\nThis means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\neg (S(t, b) \\land S(b, t))$.\nApplying this to $t_0$ and $b^*$: $\\neg (S(t_0, b^*) \\land S(b^*, t_0))$.\nThis is a direct contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that statement 4 is false must be incorrect.\nThus, statement 4 must be true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options based on this confirmed truth of statement 4.\n\n1. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove. (False, not derivable)\n2. No toves snicker-snacked every borogove. ($\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, \\neg S(t, b)$)\n   We know $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists t \\in T, \\neg S(b, t)$.\n   Suppose statement 2 is false. Then $\\exists t_",

No raths chortled at every rath. ($\\neg \\exists r_1 \\in R, \\forall r_2 \\in R, C(r_1, r_2)$)\n2. There is a rath that every rath chortled at. ($\\exists r_1 \\in R, \\forall r_2 \\in R, C(r_2, r_1)$)\n3. A rath chortled at a rath. ($\\exists r_1 \\in R, \\exists r_2 \\in R, C(r_1, r_2)$)\n4. No raths chortled at a rath. ($\\neg \\exists r_1 \\in R, \\exists r_2 \\in R, C(r_1, r_2)$)\n5. A rath chortled at every rath. ($\\exists r_1 \\in R, \\forall r_2 \\in R, C(r_1, r_2)$)\n6. Every rath chortled at every rath. ($\\forall r_1 \\in R, \\forall r_2 \\in R, C(r_1, r_2)$)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that for every $r_1 \\in R$, there exists $r_2 \\in R$ such that $C(r_1, r_2)$.\nThis directly implies that there is at least one rath that chortled at a rath.\nTherefore, statement 3: \"A rath chortled at a rath\" must be true.\nLet's prove this formally.\nAssume statement 3 is false. Then $\\neg (\\exists r_1 \\in R, \\exists r_2 \\in R, C(r_1, r_2))$.\nThis means $\\forall r_1 \\in R, \\forall r_2 \\in R, \\neg C(r_1, r_2)$.\nIn particular, for any $r_1 \\in R$, there is no $r_2 \\in R$ such that $C(r_1, r_2)$.\nThis contradicts statement 1, which says that for every $r_1 \\in R$, there exists $r_2 \\in R$ such that $C(r_1, r_2)$ (and $C(r_2, r_1)$).\nTherefore, statement 3 must be true.\n\nLet's check if any other statements must be true.\nConsider statement 4: \"No raths chortled at a rath.\" This is the negation of statement 3. Since statement 3 is true, statement 4 must be false.\n\nWhat about statements 1, 2, 5, 6?\nStatement 1: \"Every rath chortled at a rath that chortled at it.\"\nThis means that for every $r_1 \\in R$, the set $\\{r_2 \\in R \\mid C(r_2, r_1) \\land C(r_1, r_2)\\}$ is non-empty.\nThis implies that for every $r_1 \\in R$, there exists $r_2 \\in R$ such that $C(r_1, r_2)$.\nThis also implies that for every $r_1 \\in R$, there exists $r_2 \\in R$ such that $C(r_2, r_1)$.\n\nLet's consider a simple case. Let $R = \\{r_1\\}$.\nStatement 1 implies: For $r_1$, there exists $r_2 \\in R$ such that $C(r_2, r_1)$ and $C(r_1, r_2)$.\nSince $R = \\{r_1\\}$, $r_2$ must be $r_1$. So $C(r_1, r_1)$ must be true.\nIf $R = \\{r_1\\}$, then:\n- Statement 1: $C(r_1, r_1)$\n- Statement 2: $\\exists r_x \\in R, \\forall r_y \\in R, C(r_y, r_x)$. This means $C(r_1, r_1)$. So true.\n- Statement 3: $\\exists r_x \\in R, \\exists r_y \\in R, C(r_x, r_y)$. This means $C(r_1, r_1)$. So true.\n- Statement 5: $\\exists r_x \\in R, \\forall r_y \\in R, C(r_x, r_y)$. This means $C(r_1, r_1)$. So true.\n- Statement 6: $\\forall r_x \\in R, \\forall r_y \\in R, C(r_x, r_y)$. This means $C(r_1, r_1)$. So true.\n\nSo if $|R|=1$, then 2, 3, 5, 6 are all true. But we need to find what *must* be true in general.\n\nLet's consider $|R|=2$. Let $R = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.\nStatement 1:\nFor $r_1$: $\\exists r_x \\in \\{r_1, r_2\\}$ such that $C(r_x, r_1)$ and $C(r_1, r_x)$.\nFor $r_2$: $\\exists r_y \\in \\{r_1, r_2\\}$ such that $C(r_y, r_2)$ and $C(r_2, r_y)$.\n\nExample scenario:\nLet $C(r_1, r_1)$, $C(r_2, r_2)$.\nThis satisfies statement 1:\nFor $r_1$, take $r_x = r_1$. $C(r_1, r_1)$ and $C(r_1, r_1)$ holds.\nFor $r_2$, take $r_y = r_2$. $C(r_2, r_2)$ and $C(r_2, r_2)$ holds.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- Statement 1: True (by construction)\n- Statement 2: $\\exists r_x \\in R, \\forall r_y \\in R, C(r_y, r_x)$.\n  Is there $r_1$ such that $C(r_1, r_1)$ and $C(r_2, r_1)$? No, $C(r_2, r_1)$ is false.\n  Is there $r_2$ such that $C(r_1, r_2)$ and $C(r_2, r_2)$? No, $C(r_1, r_2)$ is false.\n  So statement 2 is false in this scenario.\n\n- Statement 3: $\\exists r_x \\in R, \\exists r_y \\in R, C(r_x, r_y)$.\n  $C(r_1, r_1)$ is true. So statement 3 is true.\n\n- Statement 5: $\\exists r_x \\in R, \\forall r_y \\in R, C(r_x, r_y)$.\n  Is there $r_1$ such that $C(r_1, r_1)$ and $C(r_1, r_2)$? No, $C(r_1, r_2)$ is false.\n  Is there $r_2$ such that $C(r_2, r_1)$ and $C(r_2, r_2)$? No, $C(r_2, r_1)$ is false.\n  So statement 5 is false in this scenario.\n\n- Statement 6: $\\forall r_x \\in R, \\forall r_y \\in R,",

It does *not* tell us anything about Zindle chortling at toves.\n*   There's no information that links Zindle's chortling behavior to toves.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle chortled at a tove.\n\n**Statement 2: Zindle is mimsy.**\n\n*   The only information about \"mimsy\" is related to Bungo and borogoves: \"If Bungo isn't a borogove, then no borogoves are mimsy.\"\n*   We don't know if Bungo is a borogove or not.\n*   We don't know if Zindle is a tove, borogove, or rath.\n*   Even if we knew Bungo wasn't a borogove (meaning no borogoves are mimsy), Zindle could still be mimsy if Zindle is a tove or a rath.\n*   There is no information connecting Zindle's mimsiness to anything else.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle is mimsy.\n\n**Statement 3: A tove chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Zindle.\"\n*   This statement directly contradicts the given information.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n**Statement 4: Every tove chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Zindle.\"\n*   This means that for any tove 't', 't' did not chortle at Zindle.\n*   If no toves chortled at Zindle, then it's impossible for *every* tove to have chortled at Zindle.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n**Statement 5: Not all toves chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   The given information states: \"No toves chortled at Zindle.\"\n*   This means that the set of toves that chortled at Zindle is empty.\n*   If the set of toves that chortled at Zindle is empty, then it is certainly true that it's not the case that *all* toves chortled at Zindle. In fact, *zero* toves chortled at Zindle.\n*   \"Not all toves chortled at Zindle\" is equivalent to \"There exists at least one tove that did not chortle at Zindle.\"\n*   Since \"No toves chortled at Zindle\" means *every* tove did not chortle at Zindle, it necessarily implies that there is at least one (and in fact, all) toves that did not chortle at Zindle.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be **true**.\n\n**Statement 6: Zindle chortled at every tove.**\n\n*   Similar to Statement 1, the information \"No toves chortled at Zindle\" tells us about the direction from toves to Zindle.

The conditional chortling rule (Fact 4) doesn't connect to these specific individuals or the \"chortling at Bungo\" condition.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 2: A borogove chortled at Rafin and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n*   This means: $(\\exists x \\in B, C(x, \\text{Rafin})) \\land (\\neg C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{Bungo}))$.\n*   We know the first part is true (Fact A).\n*   We have no information about $C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{Bungo})$. It could be true or false.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 3: A borogove chortled at Rafin and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This means: $(\\exists x \\in B, C(x, \\text{Rafin})) \\land C(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo})$.\n*   We know the first part is true (Fact A).\n*   We know the second part is true (Fact B).\n*   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire conjunction must be true.\n\n**Statement 4: A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n*   This means: $(\\exists x \\in B, C(x, \\text{Rafin})) \\land \\neg (\\neg C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{Bungo}))$.\n*   This simplifies to: $(\\exists x \\in B, C(x, \\text{Rafin})) \\land C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{Bungo})$.\n*   We know the first part is true (Fact A).\n*   We have no information about $C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{Bungo})$. It could be true or false.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This means: $C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{Rafin}) \\iff \\neg (\\forall x \\in B, C(x, \\text{Bungo}))$.\n*   This is equivalent to: $C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{Rafin}) \\iff (\\exists x \\in B, \\neg C(x, \\text{Bungo}))$.\n*   We have no information about $C(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{Rafin})$ or the chortling of borogoves at Bungo.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This means: $(\\exists x \\in B, C(x, \\text{Rafin})) \\land \\neg C(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo})$.\n*   We know the first part is true (Fact A).\n*   We know the second part is false, because $C(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo})$ is true (Fact B).\n*   Since the second conjunct is false, the entire conjunction must be false.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be false, not true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 3 must be true. The conditional chortling rule (Fact 4) and the \"Zindle is uffish\" part of the information are distractors for these specific statements, as they don't provide information relevant to the truth value of any of the options. The crucial pieces of information are \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" and \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\".\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

The statement \"A tove chortled at a rath that chortled at it\" tells us about a specific tove-rath pair, but not about Rafin. We cannot conclude this must be true.\n\n3.  **Rafin chortled at every rath.**\n    *   We know Rafin chortled at *a* rath (Bungo). We have no information to suggest Rafin chortled at *all* raths. This is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **No raths chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   We have no information to support this. It's the negation of statement 2, which we couldn't confirm. This is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **Every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This is a stronger version of statement 2. We have no information to support this. This is not necessarily true.\n\n6.  **Not all raths chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 5. We cannot conclude this must be true. If there's only one rath (Bungo), and it chortled at Rafin, then \"all raths chortled at Rafin\" would be true, making this statement false. We don't know the number of raths or their chortling habits towards Rafin.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the deductions, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets that cover all entities.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R). So, T \u2260 \u2205, B \u2260 \u2205, R \u2260 \u2205.\n3.  **Tove-Borogove Chortling (Initial):** A tove chortled at every borogove. This means: $\\exists t \\in T$ such that $\\forall b \\in B$, $t$ chortled at $b$.\n4.  **Mimsy/Zindle/Rafin/Rath/Bungo (Conditional):** If not all borogoves are mimsy (\u00ac($\\forall b \\in B$, $b$ is mimsy)), then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\n    This can be written as:\n    ($\\neg (\\forall b \\in B, \\text{Mimsy}(b))$) $\\implies$ ($\\neg \\text{Chortle}(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Rafin})$ $\\iff$ ($\\forall r \\in R, \\text{Chortle}(r, \\text{Bungo})$))\n5.  **Whiffle/Beamish (Facts):**\n    *   Not all borogoves will whiffle ($\\neg (\\forall b \\in B, \\text{Whiffle}(b))$).\n    *   Rafin isn't beamish ($\\neg \\text{Beamish}(\\text{Rafin})$).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's re-examine the initial statement about tove-borogove chortling: \"A tove chortled at every borogove.\"\n\nThis statement directly translates to:\n$\\exists t \\in T$ such that $\\forall b \\in B$, $t$ chortled at $b$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the options based on this direct translation:\n\n*   **1. No toves chortled at every borogove.**\n    This means: $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, t \\text{ chortled at } b)$.\n    This is the direct negation of the given information. Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n*   **2. No toves chortled at a borogove.**\n    This means: $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\exists b \\in B, t \\text{ chortled at } b)$.\n    If \"A tove chortled at every borogove\" is true, then there exists at least one tove that chortled at *all* borogoves. Since there's at least one borogove (B \u2260 \u2205), this implies that this tove chortled at *a* borogove. Therefore, this statement must be **false**.\n\n*   **3. There is a tove that every borogove chortled at.**\n    This means: $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ chortled at } t$.\n    The given information states \"A tove chortled at every borogove\" (tove chortles at borogove), not the other way around. We have no information to confirm or deny this statement. It is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **4. Every tove chortled at every borogove.**\n    This means: $\\forall t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, t \\text{ chortled at } b$.\n    The given information states \"A tove chortled at every borogove\" ($\\exists t \\in T$). This is weaker than \"Every tove chortled at every borogove\" ($\\forall t \\in T$). We know *at least one* tove did this, but not necessarily *all* toves. Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **5. A tove chortled at a borogove.**\n    This means: $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\exists b \\in B, t \\text{ chortled at } b$.\n    Since we are given that \"A tove chortled at every borogove\" ($\\exists t_0 \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, t_0 \\text{ chortled at } b$), and we know that there is at least one borogove (B \u2260 \u2205), it logically follows that this specific tove ($t_0$) must have chortled at *at least one* borogove. Therefore, this statement must be **true**.\n\n*   **6. Every tove chortled at a borogove.**\n    This means: $\\forall t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\exists b \\in B, t \\text{ chortled at } b$.\n    The given information states \"A tove chortled at every borogove\" ($\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, t \\text{ chortled at } b$). This tells us about *one* specific tove's behavior towards *all* borogoves. It does not tell us that *every* tove chortled at *at least one* borogove. For example, there could be other toves that didn't chortle at any borogove. Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based directly on the initial premise \"A tove chortled at every borogove\" and the fact that there's at least one borogove is \"A tove chortled at a borogove.\" The other complex conditions (mimsy, Zindle, Rafin, rath, Bungo, whiffle, beamish) do not affect the truth value of the statements concerning the general chortling relationship between toves and borogoves as initially described.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories.\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Property 1:** Every borogove is uffish (B -> U). This means if something is a borogove, it *must* be uffish.\n*   **Property 2:** No toves galumphed over Bungo (T -> not G_B). This means if something is a tove, it did *not* galumph over Bungo.\n*   **Property 3:** It is not the case that Zindle is uffish (not U_Z). This is a direct statement about Zindle.\n\n**Analyzing Zindle's Status:**\n\nFrom \"It is not the case that Zindle is uffish\" (not U_Z) and \"Every borogove is uffish\" (B -> U), we can deduce:\n\n*   If Zindle were a borogove (B_Z), then Zindle would be uffish (U_Z).\n*   But we know Zindle is *not* uffish (not U_Z).\n*   Therefore, Zindle cannot be a borogove. (not B_Z)\n\nSince everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath exclusively, and Zindle is not a borogove, Zindle must be either a tove or a rath.\n\n**Analyzing the Conditional Statement:**\n\n\"If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin (not C_ZR), then not all toves galumphed over Zindle (not (all T -> G_Z)) only if every borogove chortled at Bungo (all B -> C_B).\"\n\nLet's represent this symbolically:\nP: Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin (not C_ZR)\nQ: Not all toves galumphed over Zindle (not (all T -> G_Z))\nR: Every borogove chortled at Bungo (all B -> C_B)\n\nThe statement is: P -> (Q only if R)\nWhich means: P -> (R -> Q)\nOr, equivalently: P -> (not Q or R)\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the options based on our deductions:**\n\n*   **Zindle is uffish (U_Z):** We are directly told \"it is not the case that Zindle is uffish.\" So, this is false.\n*   **Zindle isn't a borogove (not B_Z):** As derived above, since Zindle is not uffish and all borogoves are uffish, Zindle cannot be a borogove. This must be true.\n\nNow let's check the other options, even though we've found one that must be true.\n\n*   **Zindle is a borogove (B_Z):** This is the opposite of what we just proved. So, this is false.\n*   **Rafin is uffish (U_R):** We have no information about Rafin's category or uffishness. This cannot be determined.\n*   **Zindle and Rafin are uffish (U_Z and U_R):** Since Zindle is not uffish, this statement is false.\n*   **Zindle and Bungo are uffish (U_Z and U_B):** Since Zindle is not uffish, this statement is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct information and logical deduction:\n1.  \"It is not the case that Zindle is uffish\" directly tells us Zindle is not uffish.\n2.  \"Every borogove is uffish.\"\n3.  If Zindle were a borogove, Zindle would be uffish.\n4.  Since Zindle is not uffish, Zindle cannot be a borogove.\n\nTherefore, \"Zindle isn't a borogove\" must be true. The complex conditional statement about chortling and galumphing is not needed to determine this specific truth.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Zindle isn't a borogove.}}$",

This is a strong statement.\n\n*   Let's analyze (4) and (5):\n    *   (4) is \"Not all raths gimbled if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin.\"\n    *   (5) is \"Rafin gimbled.\"\n\n    Consider the contrapositive of (4): \"All raths gimbled if and only if some raths chortled at Rafin.\"\n\n    Let P = \"Not all raths gimbled\" and Q = \"No raths chortled at Rafin.\"\n    So, P <=> Q.\n\n    We know Rafin gimbled. This doesn't directly tell us about *all* raths gimbling or not gimbling.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate (4) and (5).\n    If \"No raths chortled at Rafin\" is true, then \"Not all raths gimbled\" is true.\n    If \"Some raths chortled at Rafin\" is true, then \"All raths gimbled\" is true.\n\n    The fact that \"Rafin gimbled\" (5) tells us something about Rafin, but not about *all* raths. Rafin could be a rath, a tove, or a borogove.\n\n    Let's assume Rafin is a rath. If Rafin is a rath, then Rafin gimbled. This means \"Not all raths gimbled\" could still be true (if there's another rath that didn't gimble) or false (if all raths gimbled).\n\n    This part of the information (4 and 5) seems designed to be a distractor or to test careful reading. Let's see if we *need* to resolve it.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nLet's go through each statement and see if it *must* be true based on the given information.\n\n**1. Zindle gimbled.**\n    *   We know Rafin gimbled. We know Bungo chortled at Zindle. We know every rath chortled at Zindle. We have no information about Zindle's gimbling status. Zindle could be a tove, borogove, or rath. We don't know if Zindle gimbled.\n    *   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**2. A rath chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   From (3), \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   Since there's at least one rath (from (1)), it follows that *a* rath (meaning at least one rath) chortled at Zindle.\n    *   **Must be true? Yes.**\n\n**3. Zindle chortled at every rath.**\n    *   We know \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" This is the opposite direction. We have no information about Zindle chortling at anyone, let alone every rath.\n    *   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**4. No raths chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   From (3), \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" This directly contradicts statement 4.\n    *   **Must be true? No (it's false).**\n\n**5. Zindle chortled at a rath.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, we have no information about Zindle chortling at anyone.\n    *   **Must be true? No.**\n\n**6. Not all raths chortled at Zindle.**\n    *   From (3), \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" This means *all* raths chortled at Zindle.\n    *   Therefore, \"Not all raths chortled at Zindle\" is false.\n    *   **Must be true? No (it's false).**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 2 must be true. The information about gimbling and Rafin seems to be a distractor for the statements about chortling at Zindle.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(Cannot be determined)\n\nThe information about \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (from both 4 and 5) and the other complex conditional statements (2 and 3) are not needed to determine Zindle's type.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the problem and analyze each statement.\n\n**Understanding the Given Information:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a tove, a borogove, or a rath. There's at least one of each.\n*   **Zindle & Rafin:** Zindle galumphed over Rafin. This is a specific event between two entities.\n*   **Rath Snicker-Snacking:** \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.\" This is the crucial statement for analyzing the rath-related options.\n*   **Rath Burbling/Chortling:** \"A rath will burble or not all raths chortled at Bungo.\" This is a disjunction.\n\n**Analyzing \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.\"**\n\nLet R be the set of all raths.\nThe statement means: For any rath $r_1$ in R, and for any rath $r_2$ in R, $r_1$ snicker-snacked $r_2$.\n\nThis implies:\n*   Every rath snicker-snacked itself.\n*   Every rath snicker-snacked every other rath.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options related to snicker-snacking:\n\n*   **1. There is not a rath that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n    *   The given statement says \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.\" This means *every* rath $r_1$ has the property that it snicker-snacked *every* rath $r_2$. So, if we pick any rath $r_1$, it *did* snicker-snack every rath. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n*   **2. No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   Again, the given statement \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath\" directly contradicts this. It means *all* raths snicker-snacked every rath. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n*   **3. A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   Since \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath,\" it means that for *any* rath you pick, that rath snicker-snacked every rath. Therefore, it is certainly true that *a* rath (in fact, all of them) snicker-snacked every rath. This statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **4. No raths snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    *   This means that for any rath $r_1$, there is no rath $r_2$ that $r_1$ snicker-snacked. This directly contradicts \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.\" Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n*   **5. No raths snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.**\n    *   The given statement \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath\" implies that every rath snicker-snacked itself. If $r_1$ snicker-snacked $r_1$, then $r_1$ is a rath that snicker-snacked a rath ($r_1$) that snicker-snacked it ($r_1$). So, there *are* raths that snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it. This statement claims there are *no* such raths, which is false.\n\n**Analyzing \"A rath will burble or not all raths chortled at Bungo.\"**\n\nThis is a disjunction: P OR Q, where:\n*   P: A rath will burble.\n*   Q: Not all raths chortled at Bungo. (This is equivalent to: At least one rath did not chortle at Bungo.)\n\nWe know that this disjunction is true. However, we don't know which part of the disjunction is true. We cannot definitively conclude that \"A rath will burble\" (P) is true, nor can we definitively conclude that \"Not all raths chortled at Bungo\" (Q) is true.\n\n**Analyzing \"Zindle galumphed over Rafin.\"**\n\nThis statement tells us about Zindle and Rafin. We don't know if Zindle is a rath, a tove, or a borogove. We also don't know if \"burble\" is related to \"galumphed\" or if Zindle is capable of burbling.\n\n*   **6. Zindle will burble.**\n    *   We have no information connecting Zindle to burbling. The statement \"A rath will burble or not all raths chortled at Bungo\" only tells us something about raths and burbling, not about Zindle specifically. Zindle might not even be a rath. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle will burble.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

($\\neg G(\\text{Rafin})$)\n\nNow let's check the options:\n\n**Statement 1: A borogove is mimsy unless not all toves will whiffle.**\n*   \"A unless B\" is typically interpreted as \"if not B then A\".\n*   So, \"If it is not the case that (not all toves will whiffle), then a borogove is mimsy.\"\n*   This means: \"If all toves will whiffle, then a borogove is mimsy.\"\n*   From Fact B, we know \"Borogoves are not mimsy\" ($\\forall x \\in B, \\neg M(x)$).\n*   Therefore, \"A borogove is mimsy\" is false.\n*   For the implication \"If P then Q\" to be true when Q is false, P must also be false.\n*   So, \"All toves will whiffle\" must be false, meaning \"Not all toves will whiffle\" must be true.\n*   However, the statement \"A borogove is mimsy\" is definitively false based on \"Only toves are mimsy\".\n*   So, the statement \"A borogove is mimsy unless not all toves will whiffle\" means:\n    *   $(\\neg (\\text{not all toves will whiffle})) \\implies (\\text{a borogove is mimsy})$\n    *   $(\\text{all toves will whiffle}) \\implies (\\text{a borogove is mimsy})$\n    *   Since \"a borogove is mimsy\" is false, for this implication to be true, \"all toves will whiffle\" must be false. This means \"not all toves will whiffle\" is true.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate \"A unless B\" as \"A or B\".\n    *   So, \"A borogove is mimsy OR not all toves will whiffle.\"\n    *   We know \"A borogove is mimsy\" is false (from Fact B).\n    *   So, for the disjunction to be true, \"not all toves will whiffle\" must be true.\n    *   However, we don't have information about whether \"not all toves will whiffle\" is true or false. We only know \"not all *borogoves* will whiffle\".\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: Only toves are mimsy and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n*   \"Only toves are mimsy\" is true (Fact B).\n*   \"No borogoves will whiffle\" means $\\forall x \\in B, \\neg W(x)$.\n*   From Fact A, we know \"Not all borogoves will whiffle\" ($\\exists x \\in B, \\neg W(x)$). This means *at least one* borogove won't whiffle.\n*   However, \"No borogoves will whiffle\" means *all* borogoves won't whiffle. This is a stronger claim than \"not all borogoves will whiffle\".\n*   For example, if there are 3 borogoves (B1, B2, B3) and B1 doesn't whiffle, but B2 and B3 do, then \"Not all borogoves will whiffle\" is true, but \"No borogoves will whiffle\" is false.\n*   Therefore, \"no borogoves will whiffle\" is not necessarily true.\n*   Since one part of the conjunction is not necessarily true, the entire statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: A borogove is mimsy or not all toves will whiffle.**\n*   \"A borogove is mimsy\" is false (from Fact B: Borogoves are not mimsy).\n*   So, for the disjunction to be true, \"not all toves will whiffle\" must be true.\n*   We have no information about whether \"not all toves will whiffle\" is true or false. We only know about borogoves whiffing.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Not all borogoves will whiffle and only toves are mimsy.**\n*   \"Not all borogoves will whiffle\" is true (Fact A).\n*   \"Only toves are mimsy\" is true (Fact B).\n*   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire conjunction is true.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Rafin will whiffle.**\n*   We have no information about Rafin whiffing. We know Rafin is beamish and did not gyre.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: Rafin won't whiffle.**\n*   We have no information about Rafin whiffing.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(Let's denote \"X snicker-snacked Y\" as S(X, Y)). So, for all x, if x is R, then S(x, Rafin).\n4.  **Borogoves & Rath:** There is a rath (let's call it R1) that every borogove snicker-snacked. So, there exists R1 such that for all b, if b is B, then S(b, R1).\n5.  **Borogoves & Bungo & Rafin & Beamish:** If S(Bungo, B) (Bungo snicker-snacked a borogove), then (Rafin is T only if no borogoves are beamish).

It means that for any individual that is a rath, that individual performed the action \"snicker-snacked Rafin\".\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n**1. If every rath snicker-snacked Rafin, then not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n*   The premise \"every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\" is given as true in the problem statement (point 3).\n*   The conclusion \"not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin\" is the logical negation of the premise.\n*   If \"every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true, then \"not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be false.\n*   Therefore, \"If True, then False\" is a false statement.\n*   This statement must be **false**.\n\n**2. Not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n*   This is the direct negation of point 3 (\"Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\").\n*   Since point 3 is given as true, its negation must be false.\n*   This statement must be **false**.\n\n**3. A rath snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n*   From point 3: \"Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n*   From point 2: \"there's at least one of each\" (meaning there is at least one rath).\n*   If every rath snicker-snacked Rafin, and there is at least one rath, then it logically follows that *a* rath (meaning at least one rath) snicker-snacked Rafin.\n*   This statement must be **true**.\n\n**4. Rafin snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   The given information is \"Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\" (S(R, Rafin)). This describes the action of raths *towards* Rafin.\n*   This statement describes the action of Rafin *towards* raths (S(Rafin, R)).\n*   The problem does not provide any information about Rafin's actions. The direction of the \"snicker-snacked\" relationship is crucial.\n*   We cannot infer this from the given information. This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**5.

At least one of each.\n*   F2: No toves galumphed over Bungo. ($\\forall t \\in T, \\neg G(t, B)$)\n*   F3: Rafin galumphed over Zindle. ($G(R, Z)$)\n*   F4: Not all raths galumphed over Rafin. ($\\exists r \\in R, \\neg G(r, R)$)\n*   F5: A rath snicker-snacked Zindle. ($\\exists r \\in R, S(r, Z)$)\n\n---\n\n**Statement 1: A rath galumphed over Bungo unless every tove galumphed over Rafin.**\nThis is equivalent to: (Every tove galumphed over Rafin) $\\implies$ (A rath galumphed over Bungo).\nOr, using the \"unless\" definition: (A rath galumphed over Bungo) OR (Every tove galumphed over Rafin).\n\nLet's analyze the components:\n*   \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\" (Let's call this P)\n*   \"Every tove galumphed over Rafin\" (Let's call this Q)\n\nThe statement is $P \\lor Q$.\n\nWe know from F2: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This is a definite fact.\nWe don't have direct information about \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\" or \"Every tove galumphed over Rafin.\"\n\nConsider the negation of Q: \"Not every tove galumphed over Rafin\" (i.e., $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg G(t, R)$). We don't know if this is true or false.\n\nThis statement cannot be definitively determined as true. For example, if no rath galumphed over Bungo, and not every tove galumphed over Rafin, then the statement would be false. We have no information to confirm or deny either part.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 2: No toves galumphed over Bungo and every rath galumphed over Rafin.**\n\nLet's break this down:\n*   \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\": This is **TRUE** (from F2).\n*   \"every rath galumphed over Rafin\": This is the negation of F4. F4 states \"Not all raths galumphed over Rafin\" (which means $\\exists r \\in R, \\neg G(r, R)$). Therefore, \"every rath galumphed over Rafin\" is **FALSE**.\n\nSince the second part of the \"and\" statement is false, the entire statement is **FALSE**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 3: Rafin is a tove unless a rath galumphed over Bungo.**\nThis is equivalent to: (A rath galumphed over Bungo) $\\implies$ (Rafin is a tove).\nOr, using the \"unless\" definition: (Rafin is a tove) OR (A rath galumphed over Bungo).\n\nLet's analyze the components:\n*   \"Rafin is a tove\" (Let's call this P)\n*   \"A rath galumphed over Bungo\" (Let's call this Q)\n\nThe statement is $P \\lor Q$.\n\nWe know Rafin galumphed over Zindle (F3). We also know \"a rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" (F5).\nThis doesn't tell us what type of creature Rafin is. Rafin could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n\nWe have no information to confirm or deny whether Rafin is a tove, or whether a rath galumphed over Bungo. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively determined as true.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 4: A rath galumphed over Bungo or every tove galumphed over Rafin.**\nThis is the same as Statement 1.\n(A rath galumphed over Bungo) OR (Every tove galumphed over Rafin).\n\nAs with Statement 1, we don't have enough information to determine if this is true.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 5: Rafin is a tove or a rath galumphed over Bungo.**\nThis is the same as Statement 3.\n(Rafin is a tove) OR (A rath galumphed over Bungo).\n\nAs with Statement 3, we don't have enough information to determine if this is true.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 6: No toves galumphed over Bungo and not all raths galumphed over Rafin.**\n\nLet's break this down:\n*   \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\": This is **TRUE** (from F2).\n*   \"not all raths galumphed over Rafin\": This is **TRUE** (from F4).\n\nSince both parts of the \"and\" statement are true, the entire statement is **TRUE**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Statement 1: Cannot be determined.\n*   Statement 2: Must be false.\n*   Statement 3: Cannot be determined.\n*   Statement 4: Cannot be determined.\n*   Statement 5: Cannot be determined.\n*   Statement 6: Must be true.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is Statement 6.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively). This means an entity cannot be more than one of these types.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (tove, borogove, rath).\n3.  **Borogove-Rath Relationship:** Every borogove snicker-snacked a rath. (This is a crucial piece of information).\n4.  **Bungo & Zindle:** Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle. (This seems like a distractor, as we don't know if Bungo or Zindle are toves, borogoves, or raths, and it doesn't directly relate to the snicker-snacking between borogoves and raths).\n5.  **Borogove & Whiffle:** A borogove will whiffle. (Another potential distractor, as \"whiffle\" is a new action unrelated to \"snicker-snack\").\n6.  **Zindle & Rafin:** Zindle isn't beamish and Rafin isn't beamish. (More distractors, introducing \"beamish\" which is irrelevant).\n\n**Focus on the Core Relationship:**\n\nThe most important piece of information for evaluating the statements is: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked a rath.\"\n\nLet's represent this formally:\nLet B be the set of borogoves.\nLet R be the set of raths.\nThe relationship \"snicker-snacked\" is a binary relation, let's call it S.\nThe statement means: For every b in B, there exists at least one r in R such that b S r.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. A borogove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n*   The given information states: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked a rath.\"\n*   If *every* borogove snicker-snacked *a* rath, then it logically follows that *at least one* borogove snicker-snacked *a* rath.\n*   **This statement must be true.**\n\n**2. There is a borogove that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n*   This means: There exists a b in B such that for every r in R, b S r.\n*   The given information says: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked *a* rath\" (meaning *at least one* rath). It does *not* say that any single borogove snicker-snacked *all* raths.\n*   Consider a scenario: Borogove1 snicker-snacked RathA. Borogove2 snicker-snacked RathB. If RathA and RathB are the only raths, then no single borogove snicker-snacked *every* rath.\n*   **This statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**3. No borogoves snicker-snacked a rath.**\n*   This is the direct opposite of the given information (\"Every borogove snicker-snacked a rath\").\n*   **This statement must be false.**\n\n**4. No borogoves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   This means: For every b in B, it is NOT the case that b snicker-snacked every rath. Or, for every b in B, there exists at least one r in R that b did NOT snicker-snack.\n*   The given information (\"Every borogove snicker-snacked a rath\") only guarantees that each borogove snicker-snacked *at least one* rath. It does not preclude a borogove from snicker-snacking *every* rath.\n*   Consider a scenario: There is only one Rath (R1). Every borogove snicker-snacked R1. In this case, every borogove *did* snicker-snack every rath (because there's only one). So, this statement (\"No borogoves snicker-snacked every rath\") would be false.\n*   Therefore, **this statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**5. A borogove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   This means: There exists a b in B such that for every r in R, b S r.\n*   This is the same as statement 2.\n*   As explained for statement 2, the given information (\"Every borogove snicker-snacked a rath\") does not guarantee that any single borogove snicker-snacked *all* raths. It only guarantees that each borogove snicker-snacked *at least one* rath.\n*   **This statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**6. Every borogove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   This means: For every b in B, and for every r in R, b S r.\n*   The given information states: \"Every borogove snicker-snacked *a* rath.\" This means for each borogove, there's *at least one* rath it snicker-snacked. It does *not* mean it snicker-snacked *all* raths.\n*   Consider a scenario: Borogove1 snicker-snacked RathA. Borogove1 did *not* snicker-snack RathB. This scenario is consistent with \"Every borogove snicker-snacked a rath\" (assuming Borogove1 is the only borogove, or other borogoves also snicker-snacked at least one rath). In this scenario, \"Every borogove snicker-snacked every rath\" would be false.\n*   **This statement does not necessarily have to be true.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a tove (T), a borogove (B), or a rath (R).\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Rath-Tove Galumphing:** Every rath galumphed over every tove. (This is a direct statement, let's call it G(r, t) for \"r galumphed over t\").\n*   **Rath-Rafin/Zindle Galumphing:** Every rath galumphed over Rafin. A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n*   **Conditional Statement:** If Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo (let's call this \u00acS(B,B)), then not all toves galumphed over Zindle (\u00ac\u2200t G(t,Z)) only if no toves gimbled (\u00ac\u2203t G(t,gimble)). This can be written as: \u00acS(B,B) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200t G(t,Z) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203t G(t,gimble)).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nWe need to determine which of the provided statements *must* be true.\n\n**1. A rath galumphed over every tove.**\n    *   This is directly stated in the problem: \"Every rath galumphed over every tove.\"\n    *   **Must be true.**\n\n**2. No toves galumphed over every rath.**\n    *   Let's consider if this *could* be false. If it were false, then \"Some tove galumphed over every rath\" would be true.\n    *   Let 't1' be a specific tove. If t1 galumphed over every rath, then for any rath 'r', G(t1, r) is true.\n    *   We know that every rath galumphed over every tove (G(r, t)).\n    *   Does G(t1, r) contradict G(r, t1)? Not necessarily. The relationship \"galumphed over\" is not necessarily symmetric or asymmetric.\n    *   However, the problem doesn't give us any information about toves galumphing over raths. It only states that raths galumphed over toves.\n    *   Consider a scenario: There's one tove (T1) and one rath (R1). We know G(R1, T1). Does T1 galumph over R1? We don't know.\n    *   Consider another scenario: T1, T2, R1, R2. We know G(R1, T1), G(R1, T2), G(R2, T1), G(R2, T2).\n    *   If \"No toves galumphed over every rath\" were false, then there exists at least one tove (say T_x) such that T_x galumphed over *every* rath.\n    *   The problem does not provide any information that would force this to be true or false. We cannot deduce this from the given information.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**3. Every tove galumphed over a rath.**\n    *   This means for every tove 't', there exists at least one rath 'r' such that G(t, r).\n    *   Again, the given information only states that raths galumphed over toves (G(r, t)). It does not provide any information about toves galumphing over raths.\n    *   We cannot deduce this.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**4. A tove galumphed over a rath.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one tove 't' and at least one rath 'r' such that G(t, r).\n    *   Similar to 2 and 3, we have no information about toves galumphing over raths.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**5. A tove galumphed over every rath.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 2. If statement 2 is \"No toves galumphed over every rath\", then statement 5 is \"Some tove galumphed over every rath\".\n    *   Since we couldn't determine statement 2, we cannot determine statement 5 either.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**6. Every tove galumphed over every rath.**\n    *   This means for every tove 't' and every rath 'r', G(t, r) is true.\n    *   This is a very strong statement. We only know the reverse: every rath galumphed over every tove.\n    *   There is no information to support this.\n    *   **Cannot be determined.**\n\n**Revisiting the Conditional Statement:**\n\nThe conditional statement: \"If Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo, then not all toves galumphed over Zindle only if no toves gimbled.\"\n\u00acS(B,B) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200t G(t,Z) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203t G(t,gimble))\n\nThis statement is a complex conditional. It tells us something about the relationship between Bungo's actions, toves galumphing over Zindle, and toves gimbling. However, none of the statements we are evaluating (1-6) involve Bungo, Zindle, or gimbling. Therefore, this conditional statement, regardless of its truth value or the truth value of its components, does not provide any information that would help us deduce the truth of statements 1-6, which are about the relationship between toves and raths.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that is directly given in the problem description is \"Every rath galumphed over every tove.\" Statement 1 is a rephrasing of this. None of the other statements can be logically deduced from the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

This means if something is a tove, it is uffish.\n6.  **Zindle's Non-Type/Tove Property:** Zindle isn't a borogove (Z $\\notin$ B) OR every tove is uffish (T $\\subseteq$ U).\n7.  **Conditional Tove Property:** Every tove is uffish (T $\\subseteq$ U) UNLESS a rath galumphed over Zindle (R g Z). This means: (R g Z) $\\implies$ (T $\\not\\subseteq$ U). And its contrapositive: (T $\\subseteq$ U) $\\implies$ $\\neg$(R g Z).\n\n**Analysis of Given Information:**\n\n*   From (3) Zindle is a tove, and (5) A tove is uffish, we can directly deduce that **Zindle is uffish**. This makes statement (1) true.\n*   Let's check the consistency of (6) and (7).\n    *   From (3) Zindle is a tove, and (5) A tove is uffish, it means that *every tove is uffish* (T $\\subseteq$ U) is a true statement. If Zindle is a tove and Zindle is uffish, and \"A tove is uffish\" means *all* toves are uffish, then T $\\subseteq$ U is true.\n    *   If T $\\subseteq$ U is true, then from (7), it must be that a rath did *not* galumph over Zindle ($\\neg$(R g Z)).\n    *   Now consider (6): \"Zindle isn't a borogove (Z $\\notin$ B) OR every tove is uffish (T $\\subseteq$ U)\".\n        *   We know Zindle is a tove (3), and categories are exclusive (1), so Zindle cannot be a borogove. Thus, Z $\\notin$ B is true.\n        *   Since Z $\\notin$ B is true, the entire disjunction in (6) is true, regardless of whether \"every tove is uffish\" is true or false. This means (6) provides no new information about \"every tove is uffish\" beyond what (5) already implies.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate \"A tove is uffish\" (5) and \"Every tove is uffish\" (T $\\subseteq$ U).**\nThe phrasing \"A tove is uffish\" typically implies that *all* toves are uffish. If it meant \"at least one tove is uffish,\" it would usually be phrased as \"Some toves are uffish.\" Therefore, we interpret (5) as T $\\subseteq$ U.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n1.  **Zindle is uffish:**\n    *   Zindle is a tove (Given 3).\n    *   A tove is uffish (Given 5, interpreted as all toves are uffish).\n    *   Therefore, Zindle is uffish.\n    *   **Statement (1) is TRUE.**\n\n2.  **Rath and Zindle:**\n    *   Since \"Every tove is uffish\" (T $\\subseteq$ U) is true (from 5), then according to (7), it must be that a rath did *not* galumph over Zindle ($\\neg$(R g Z)).\n\n3.  **Galumphing over Zindle:**\n    *   We know Zindle galumphed over Zindle (Given 4). This means Zindle is one of the things that galumphed over Zindle.\n    *   Zindle is a tove. So, \"A tove galumphed over Zindle\" is true (specifically, Zindle itself, which is a tove).\n    *   **Statement (3) is TRUE.**\n\n4.  **No toves galumphed over Zindle:**\n    *   This contradicts (3) and the fact that Zindle (a tove) galumphed over Zindle.\n    *   **Statement (2) is FALSE.**\n\n5.  **Zindle galumphed over every tove:**\n    *   We only know Zindle galumphed over Zindle. We have no information about Zindle galumphing over *other* toves. We cannot confirm or deny this.\n    *   **Statement (4) is UNKNOWN.**\n\n6.  **Not all toves galumphed over Zindle:**\n    *   This is the negation of \"Every tove galumphed over Zindle.\"\n    *   We don't know if every tove galumphed over Zindle. If there's only one tove (Zindle), then Zindle galumphed over every tove (itself). If there are other toves, we don't know if Zindle galumphed over them.\n    *   **Statement (5) is UNKNOWN.**\n\n7.  **Every tove galumphed over Zindle:**\n    *   We only know Zindle galumphed over Zindle. We have no information about other toves galumphing over Zindle.\n    *   **Statement (6) is UNKNOWN.**\n\n**Summary of Truth Values:**\n\n1.  Zindle is uffish. **TRUE**\n2.  No toves galumphed over Zindle. **FALSE** (Zindle, a tove, galumphed over Zindle)\n3.  A tove galumphed over Zindle. **TRUE** (Zindle, a tove, galumphed over Zindle)\n4.  Zindle galumphed over every tove. **UNKNOWN**\n5.  Not all toves galumphed over Zindle. **UNKNOWN**\n6.

Let's call it $t_1$.\nAccording to premise 2, for this $t_1$, every rath $r$ snicker-snacked $t_1$.\nSo, $\\forall r \\in R, S(r, t_1)$.\nThis perfectly matches the structure of statement 4.\n\nTherefore, statement 4 **must be true** based solely on premise 2 and the existence of at least one tove.\n\n**What about the other statements?**\n\nThe other premises (3, 4, 5) and the specific entities like Bungo and Rafin, or the property \"mimsy\", do not seem to relate to the \"tove snicker-snacked rath\" or \"rath snicker-snacked tove\" relationships in a way that would force the truth of the other statements. The crucial information for statements 1-6 is about the snicker-snacking relationship between toves and raths.\n\nLet's consider if any other statement *must* be true.\n\n*   **Statement 1: \"A tove snicker-snacked a rath.\"** ($\\exists t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, S(t, r)$)\n    *   Premise 2 states $S(r, t)$ for all $r, t$. It does not state $S(t, r)$. We cannot infer this.\n    *   Consider a scenario: Toves only snicker-snack borogoves (as in premise 3), and raths only snicker-snack toves. In this scenario, statement 1 would be false. So, it's not necessarily true.\n\n*   **Statement 2: \"Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\"** ($\\forall t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(t, r)$)\n    *   This is the inverse of premise 2. Premise 2 is $S(r, t)$. This is $S(t, r)$. We cannot infer this.\n    *   Same counter-example as for statement 1.\n\n*   **Statement 3: \"A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\"** ($\\exists t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(t, r)$)\n    *   This is a stronger version of statement 1. If statement 2 is not true, this is unlikely to be true.\n    *   Same counter-example as for statement 1.\n\n*   **Statement 5: \"No toves snicker-snacked every rath.\"** ($\\neg (\\exists t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(t, r))$)\n    *   This is the negation of statement 3. Since statement 3 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either.\n\n*   **Statement 6: \"Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.\"** ($\\forall t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, S(t, r)$)\n    *   This is a weaker version of statement 2. Still, we cannot infer this from premise 2.\n    *   Same counter-example as for statement 1.\n\nThe only statement that is directly and necessarily implied by the premises is statement 4.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nPremise 2: \"Every rath snicker-snacked every tove.\"\nIn logical notation: $\\forall r \\in R, \\forall t \\in T, S(r, t)$.\n\nStatement 4: \"There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked.\"\nIn logical notation: $\\exists t_0 \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(r, t_0)$.\n\nSince we know $|T| \\ge 1$, there exists at least one tove. Let's pick an arbitrary tove, say $t^*$.\nFrom Premise 2, we know that for this specific $t^*$, it is true that $\\forall r \\in R, S(r, t^*)$.\nThis directly fulfills the condition for Statement 4. Therefore, Statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

If `not A` is false (i.e., `A` is true), then `B` must be false.\n    *   Case 1: `not A` is true AND `B` is true. This means \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" AND \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This is consistent. If no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then it's certainly true that not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n    *   Case 2: `not A` is false AND `B` is false. This means \"All toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" AND \"It's not true that no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (i.e., \"At least one tove snicker-snacked Zindle\"). This is also consistent.\n    *   So, the statement `(not A) <=> B` means either (no toves snicker-snacked Zindle) OR (all toves snicker-snacked Zindle).

A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.**\nThis statement is `exists t1 in T, forall t2 in T, (snicker-snacked(t2, t1) => snicker-snacked(t1, t2))`.\nSince premise 2 states that `forall t1, t2 in T, (snicker-snacked(t2, t1) => snicker-snacked(t1, t2))`, this means that *every* tove `t1` has the property that it snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it.\nTherefore, if it's true for *every* tove, it must be true for *at least one* tove.\nSo, statement 5 is a direct consequence of premise 2.\n\n**Let's check the other statements:**\n\n*   **Statement 6: Every tove snicker-snacked every tove.** (`forall t1, t2 in T, snicker-snacked(t1, t2)`)\n    *   If this were true, then the relation is universal.\n    *   However, the premises do not force this. Consider a scenario with two toves, T1 and T2. If T1 snicker-snacked T2, but T2 did not snicker-snack T1, this would violate symmetry. But if neither snicker-snacked the other, or if they both snicker-snacked each other, symmetry holds.\n    *   The premises don't require any toves to snicker-snack any other toves. It's possible that no toves snicker-snacked any toves. In that case, statement 6 would be false.\n\n*   **Statement 1: A tove snicker-snacked a tove.** (`exists t1, t2 in T, snicker-snacked(t1, t2)`)\n    *   If no toves snicker-snacked any toves, this statement would be false. The premises do not prevent this.\n    *   For example, if the `snicker-snacked` relation is empty among toves, then premise 2 (symmetry) still holds vacuously.\n\n*   **Statement 4: Every tove snicker-snacked a tove.** (`forall t1 in T, exists t2 in T, snicker-snacked(t1, t2)`)\n    *   This means every tove snicker-snacked *at least one* tove.\n    *   Again, if the `snicker-snacked` relation is empty among toves, this would be false.\n\n*   **Statement 2: A tove snicker-snacked every tove.** (`exists t1 in T, forall t2 in T, snicker-snacked(t1, t2)`)\n    *   This means there's a \"universal snicker-snacker\" among toves.\n    *   This is not forced by the premises.\n\n*   **Statement 3: No toves snicker-snacked every tove.** (`not (exists t1 in T, forall t2 in T, snicker-snacked(t1, t2))`) - This is the negation of statement 2.\n    *   If statement 2 is not necessarily true, then its negation is not necessarily true either.\n    *   Consider a case where there is only one tove, T1. If T1 snicker-snacked T1, then T1 snicker-snacked every tove (since T1 is the only tove). In this case, statement 2 would be true, and statement 3 would be false.\n    *   Consider a case where there are two toves, T1 and T2. If T1 snicker-snacked T2, and T2 snicker-snacked T1 (due to symmetry), but T1 did not snicker-snack T1, and T2 did not snicker-snack T2. In this case, neither T1 nor T2 snicker-snacked *every* tove (because they didn't snicker-snack themselves). So statement 2 is false, and statement 3 is true.\n    *   Since we can construct scenarios where statement 3 is true and where it is false, it is not *necessarily* true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is statement 5, because it is a direct existential quantification of the universal property stated in premise 2. If \"Every tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it\" (Premise 2) is true, then it logically follows that \"A tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked it\" (Statement 5) must also be true, as long as there is at least one tove. We are told there is at least one of each (tove, borogove, rath).\n\nThe final answer is $\\",

From P4, we know that *no* toves chortled at Bungo (\u2200x (Tx \u2192 \u00acC(x, Bungo))). If no toves chortled at Bungo, then it's certainly true that not all toves chortled at Bungo (because if all did, it would contradict P4). So, the first part is true.\n*   \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove\": This means \u00ac(\u00acTRafin), which simplifies to TRafin.\n*   However, P5 explicitly states \"Rafin isn't a tove\" (\u00acTRafin). Therefore, TRafin must be false.\n*   Since the second part of the conjunction is false, the entire statement 1 is **false**.\n\n**Option 2: Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n*   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\": As established in Option 1, this is true based on P4.\n*   \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\": This means \u00ac(\u00acC(Rafin, Bungo)), which simplifies to C(Rafin, Bungo).\n*   We have no information that forces C(Rafin, Bungo) to be true. Rafin is not a tove (P5), so P4 (no toves chortled at Bungo) doesn't apply to Rafin. Rafin could be a borogove or a rath. We cannot definitively say C(Rafin, Bungo) is true.\n*   Since we cannot confirm the second part, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Option 3: Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n*   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\": As established, this is true based on P4.\n*   \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\": This means \u00acC(Rafin, Bungo).\n*   Again, we have no information that forces \u00acC(Rafin, Bungo) to be true. Rafin could be a borogove and chortle at Bungo, or a rath and chortle at Bungo. We cannot definitively say \u00acC(Rafin, Bungo) is true.\n*   Since we cannot confirm the second part, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Option 4: Not all toves chortled at Bungo and no toves chortled at Rafin.**\n*   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\": As established, this is true based on P4.\n*   \"no toves chortled at Rafin\": This means \u2200x (Tx \u2192 \u00acC(x, Rafin)).\n*   We have no information about toves chortling at Rafin. This statement is not supported by the given premises.\n*   Since we cannot confirm the second part, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Option 5: Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n*   \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\": This is directly stated in P3 (\u00acC(Bungo, Bungo)). This part is **true**.\n*   \"Rafin isn't a tove\": This is directly stated in P5 (\u00acTRafin). This part is **true**.\n*   Since both parts of the conjunction are true based on the given premises, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Option 6: Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n*   This statement is of the form \"P if and only if not P\" (P \u2194 \u00acP).\n*   Let P be \"Every borogove is mimsy\" (\u2200x (Bx \u2192 Mimsy(x))).\n*   Then \u00acP is \"Not all borogoves are mimsy\" (\u00ac\u2200x (Bx \u2192 Mimsy(x))).\n*   The statement is (\u2200x (Bx \u2192 Mimsy(x))) \u2194 (\u00ac\u2200x (Bx \u2192 Mimsy(x))).\n*   A biconditional P \u2194 Q is true if P and Q have the same truth value.\n*   Here, Q is \u00acP. So, P \u2194 \u00acP is true if P and \u00acP have the same truth value. This is impossible, as P and \u00acP always have opposite truth values.\n*   Therefore, P \u2194 \u00acP is always false.\n*   This statement is a logical contradiction and thus **false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a tove (T), a borogove (B), or a rath (R).\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Borogoves & Rafin:** No borogoves galumphed over Rafin. (This means for any borogove 'b', it is NOT true that 'b galumphed over Rafin').\n4.  **Rath-Borogove-Rath Chain:** A rath (R1) galumphed over a borogove (B1) that galumphed over a rath (R2). (R1 -> B1 -> R2)\n5.  **Raths & Rafin (Part 1):** Not all raths galumphed over Rafin. (This means there exists at least one rath 'r' such that 'r did NOT galumph over Rafin').\n6.  **Raths & Rafin (Part 2):** It is not the case that Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle. (This is a double negative. \"Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle\" is false. Therefore, \"Rafin galumphed over Zindle\" is true). *This piece of information seems irrelevant to the relationship between Rafin and toves, borogoves, or raths, but it's a true statement within the context.*\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's use the notation `X > Y` to mean \"X galumphed over Y\".\n\n*   **From (3): No borogoves galumphed over Rafin.**\n    This is a crucial piece of information. It directly tells us about the relationship between borogoves and Rafin.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. A borogove galumphed over Rafin.**\n    *   This directly contradicts statement (3) which says \"No borogoves galumphed over Rafin.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**2. Rafin galumphed over every borogove.**\n    *   We know from (3) that `b > Rafin` is false for all borogoves `b`.\n    *   We have no information about `Rafin > b`. The given information does not provide enough evidence to confirm or deny this.\n    *   For example, if there's one borogove B1, and Rafin did not galumph over B1, then this statement would be false. If Rafin did galumph over B1, it would be true for that single borogove. We don't know.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**3. A borogove galumphed over Rafin or Rafin galumphed over Rafin.**\n    *   We already established that \"A borogove galumphed over Rafin\" is false (from (3)).\n    *   So, for the \"or\" statement to be true, \"Rafin galumphed over Rafin\" would have to be true.\n    *   We have no information whatsoever about Rafin galumphing over Rafin. It's a self-referential action that isn't addressed by the rules.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**4. Rafin galumphed over a borogove.**\n    *   We know `b > Rafin` is false for all `b`.\n    *   This statement is `Rafin > b` for *at least one* borogove `b`.\n    *   The given information does not provide any direct or indirect evidence for this. It's possible Rafin galumphed over no borogoves, or over some, or over all. We simply don't know.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **does not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**5. Every borogove galumphed over Rafin.**\n    *   This statement means `b > Rafin` for *all* borogoves `b`.\n    *   This directly contradicts statement (3) which says \"No borogoves galumphed over Rafin.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**6. Not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin.**\n    *   This statement means \"It is not the case that (for every borogove `b`, `b > Rafin`)\".\n    *   This is equivalent to \"There exists at least one borogove `b` such that `b` did NOT galumph over Rafin.\"\n    *   From statement (3), we know \"No borogoves galumphed over Rafin.\" This means for *every single borogove*, it is true that it did NOT galumph over Rafin.\n    *   If it's true for *every* borogove that it didn't galumph over Rafin, then it's certainly true that *not all* of them galumphed over Rafin (because *none* of them did).\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. Not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin.**",

It doesn't give us a definitive truth value for either of those actions.\n\n**Let's extract the definite facts we know:**\n\n*   **Fact A:** Chortled(Rafin, Zindle) (from point 3)\n*   **Fact B:** If X is a tove, then X did not chortle at Rafin. (from point 2)\n*   **Fact C:** There are toves, borogoves, and raths, and everything is exactly one of them.\n\n**Now let's evaluate each statement:**\n\n**Statement 1: Rafin is a tove unless Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n*   \"A unless B\" means \"A or B\" (inclusive OR), and often implies \"if not B then A\".\n*   So, this statement is equivalent to: Tove(Rafin) $\\lor \\neg$ Chortled(Zindle, Rafin).\n*   We know Fact A: Chortled(Rafin, Zindle). This tells us nothing about Chortled(Zindle, Rafin).\n*   Let's consider the two parts:\n    *   Is Rafin a tove? We don't know Rafin's type.\n    *   Did Zindle chortle at Rafin? We don't know.\n*   Since we don't know if Rafin is a tove, and we don't know if Zindle chortled at Rafin, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 2: Rafin is a tove or Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n*   This is the same as Statement 1: Tove(Rafin) $\\lor \\neg$ Chortled(Zindle, Rafin).\n*   As explained for Statement 1, we cannot determine if this must be true.\n\n**Statement 3: No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n*   First part: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This is directly given in the problem (point 2). So, this part is TRUE.\n*   Second part: \"Rafin chortled at Zindle.\" This is directly given in the problem (point 3). So, this part is TRUE.\n*   Since both parts are true, the conjunction (\"and\") is TRUE.\n*   Therefore, Statement 3 **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 4: No toves chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n*   \"A but B\" means \"A and B\".\n*   First part: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This is TRUE (from point 2).\n*   Second part: \"it is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle.\" This means $\\neg$ Chortled(Rafin, Zindle).\n*   However, we know from point 3 that \"Rafin chortled at Zindle\" is TRUE.\n*   Therefore, $\\neg$ Chortled(Rafin, Zindle) is FALSE.\n*   Since the second part is false, the entire conjunction is FALSE.\n*   Therefore, Statement 4 **must be false**.\n\n**Statement 5: Rafin is a tove or it is not the case that Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin.**\n*   \"it is not the case that Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin\" simplifies to \"Zindle chortled at Rafin\".\n*   So, the statement is: Tove(Rafin) $\\lor$ Chortled(Zindle, Rafin).\n*   Similar to Statements 1 and 2, we don't know if Rafin is a tove, and we don't know if Zindle chortled at Rafin.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: If Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle, then a tove chortled at Rafin.**\n*   This is a conditional statement: $\\neg$ Chortled(Zindle, Zindle) $\\implies$ $\\exists$ T (Tove(T) $\\land$ Chortled(T, Rafin)).\n*   Let's look at the consequent: \"a tove chortled at Rafin.\"\n*   From point 2, we know \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\" This means it is **false** that \"a tove chortled at Rafin.\"\n*   So, the consequent of the conditional is FALSE.\n*   For a conditional (P $\\implies$ Q) to be true when Q is false, P must also be false.\n*   So, for this statement to be true, it must be the case that Zindle *did* chortle at Zindle.\n*   However, we have no information about whether Zindle chortled at Zindle.\n*   Since the consequent is definitively false, and we don't know the truth value of the antecedent, we cannot determine if this statement must be true. If Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle (antecedent is true), then the statement would be false. If Zindle did chortle at Zindle (antecedent is false), then the statement would be true. We don't know.\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 does not **must be true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

(B(x) AND T(y) AND SS(y, x) -> SS(x, y))\n*   **Bungo's Chortling:** Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo. (NOT C(Bungo, Bungo))\n*   **Rafin and Zindle:** Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle.

This means Rafin *did* chortle at Bungo. (C(Rafin, Bungo))\n*   **Conditional Statement:** If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo (Premise P), then Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo (Premise Q) only if every rath galumphed over Rafin (Premise R).\n    *   P: For all x, R(x) -> SS(x, Bungo)\n    *   Q: NOT SS(Bungo, Bungo)\n    *   R: For all x, R(x) -> G(x, Rafin)\n    *   The statement is: P -> (Q -> R)\n\n**Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:**\n\n1.  **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.** (NOT C(Bungo, Bungo)) - This is a direct statement.\n2.  **Rafin isn't a tove.** (NOT T(Rafin)) - This is a direct statement.\n3.  **Rafin did chortle at Bungo.** (C(Rafin, Bungo)) - This is derived from \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\"\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on what we know:\n\n*   **Option 1: Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n    *   We know \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is true (C(Rafin, Bungo)).\n    *   We don't yet know if \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n\n*   **Option 2: Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n    *   \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" is true (NOT C(Bungo, Bungo)).\n    *   \"Rafin isn't a tove\" is true (NOT T(Rafin)).\n    *   Since both conjuncts are true, this entire statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **Option 3: Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n    *   \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is false (we know C(Rafin, Bungo)).\n    *   Therefore, this entire statement **must be false**.\n\n*   **Option 4: Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n    *   \"Rafin isn't a tove\" is true (NOT T(Rafin)).\n    *   We don't yet know if \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n\n*   **Option 5: Not all toves chortled at Bungo and no toves chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   We don't know if \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n    *   We don't know if \"no toves chortled at Rafin\" is true.\n\n*   **Option 6: Not all toves chortled at Bungo but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n    *   \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove\" means Rafin *is* a tove (T(Rafin)).\n    *   We know Rafin isn't a tove (NOT T(Rafin)).\n    *   Therefore, \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove\" is false.\n    *   Since the second conjunct is false, this entire statement **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion so far:** Option 2 is definitely true. Let's see if we can determine anything about \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nWe have the conditional: P -> (Q -> R)\nP: For all x, R(x) -> SS(x, Bungo)\nQ: NOT SS(Bungo, Bungo)\nR: For all x, R(x) -> G(x, Rafin)\n\nWe also know: Every rath galumphed over Bungo. (For all x, R(x) -> G(x, Bungo))\n\nThe problem doesn't provide enough information to determine if \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is true or false. For example, we don't know anything about toves and chortling, except that Bungo isn't a tove (since Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo, and if Bungo were a tove, and all toves chortled at Bungo, then Bungo would chortle at Bungo, which is a contradiction).\n\nHowever, the question asks which statement *must* be true. We have already found one that must be true based on direct deductions.\n\nLet's re-check the options and our deductions:\n\n*   **Option 1:** \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" (unknown) AND \"Rafin did chortle at Bungo\" (true). Since one part is unknown, the whole statement is not necessarily true.\n*   **Option 2:** \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" (true) AND \"Rafin isn't a tove\" (true). Both parts are true, so the conjunction is true.\n*   **Option 3:** \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" (unknown) AND \"Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" (false). Since one part is false, the conjunction is false.\n*   **Option 4:** \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" (unknown) AND \"Rafin isn't a tove\" (true). Since one part is unknown, the whole statement is not necessarily true.\n*   **Option 5:** \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" (unknown) AND \"no toves chortled at Rafin\" (unknown). Not necessarily true.\n*   **Option 6:** \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" (unknown) AND \"Rafin is a tove\" (false). Since one part is false, the conjunction is false.\n\nTherefore, only Option 2 is definitively true based on the given information.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

It introduces specific names (Bungo, Zindle) and a new action (whiffle) that are not connected to the core problem. We can ignore this part for the purpose of evaluating the given statements.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet's combine information (2) and (3).\n\nFrom (3): $\\forall t_1 \\in T, \\forall t_2 \\in T_{SB}, S(t_1, t_2)$.\nThis means that if $T_{SB}$ is not empty, then every tove snicker-snacked every tove in $T_{SB}$. In other words, if $T_{SB}$ contains any toves, then those toves were snicker-snacked by *all* toves.\n\nFrom (2): $\\forall t_1 \\in T, \\exists t_2 \\in T \\text{ such that } \\neg S(t_2, t_1)$.\nThis means that no tove was snicker-snacked by *every* tove.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications for $T_{SB}$:\n\n*   Suppose $T_{SB}$ is not empty. Let $t^* \\in T_{SB}$.\n*   According to (3), since $t^* \\in T_{SB}$, then $\\forall t \\in T, S(t, t^*)$.\n*   This means $t^*$ was snicker-snacked by every tove.\n*   However, according to (2), there is no tove that was snicker-snacked by every tove.\n*   This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that $T_{SB}$ is not empty must be false.\nThis means $T_{SB}$ must be empty.\n\n$T_{SB} = \\emptyset$ implies that there is no tove that snicker-snacked every borogove.\nIn logical terms: $\\neg \\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } (\\forall b \\in B, S(t, b))$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1.  **No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   This statement is: $\\neg \\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } (\\forall b \\in B, S(t, b))$.\n    *   This is exactly what we deduced: $T_{SB} = \\emptyset$.\n    *   **This statement must be true.**\n\n2.  **No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   This statement is: $\\neg \\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } S(t, b)$.\n    *   This means no tove snicker-snacked any borogove at all.\n    *   Our deduction ($T_{SB} = \\emptyset$) only says that no tove snicker-snacked *every* borogove. It doesn't preclude a tove from snicker-snacking *some* borogoves.\n    *   For example, if Toves A and B exist, and Borogoves X and Y exist:\n        *   A snicker-snacked X, but not Y.\n        *   B snicker-snacked Y, but not X.\n        *   In this scenario, $T_{SB}$ is empty (neither A nor B snicker-snacked *every* borogove).\n        *   However, A snicker-snacked a borogove (X), and B snicker-snacked a borogove (Y). So statement 2 would be false.\n    *   Therefore, **this statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n3.  **A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   This statement is: $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } S(t, b)$.\n    *   This is the negation of statement 2. Since statement 2 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either.\n    *   Consider a scenario where no tove snicker-snacked any borogove. This would make statement 3 false. This scenario is consistent with $T_{SB} = \\emptyset$.\n    *   Therefore, **this statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n4.  **A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   This statement is: $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } (\\forall b \\in B, S(t, b))$.\n    *   This is the negation of statement 1. Since statement 1 must be true, its negation must be false.\n    *   Therefore, **this statement must be false.**\n\n5.  **Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   This statement is: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, S(t, b)$.\n    *   If this were true, then every tove would be in $T_{SB}$.\n    *   But we know $T_{SB}$ is empty.\n    *   Therefore, **this statement must be false.**\n\n6.  **Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   This statement is: $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } S(t, b)$.\n    *   This means for every tove, there's at least one borogove it snicker-snacked.\n    *   This is consistent with $T_{SB} = \\emptyset$. For example, Tove A snicker-snacked Borogove X but not Y. Tove B snicker-snacked Borogove Y but not X. In this case, $T_{SB}$ is empty, but statement 6 is true.\n    *   However, it's also possible that some tove didn't snicker-snack any borogove. For example, Tove A snicker-snacked X, but Tove B snicker-snacked nothing. In this case, $T_{SB}$ is empty, but statement 6 is false.\n    *   Therefore, **this statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) exclusively. This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets, and their union covers everything.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Toves & Zindle:** Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, S(t, Zindle)). This implies there is at least one tove that did *not* snicker-snack Zindle (\u2203t \u2208 T, \u00acS(t, Zindle)).\n4.  **Borogoves & Whiffle:** A borogove will whiffle (\u2200b \u2208 B, W(b)).\n5.  **Borogoves & Zindle:** Every borogove chortled at Zindle (\u2200b \u2208 B, C(b, Zindle)).\n6.  **Raths & Rafin (Conditional):** If every rath snicker-snacked Rafin (\u2200r \u2208 R, S(r, Rafin)), then not all raths snicker-snacked Rafin (\u00ac\u2200r \u2208 R, S(r, Rafin)).\n\n**Analysis of the Rath/Rafin Conditional (Point 6):**\n\nLet P be the statement \"Every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\" (\u2200r \u2208 R, S(r, Rafin)).\nThe conditional is \"If P, then \u00acP\".\nThis is a classic logical contradiction. The only way for \"If P, then \u00acP\" to be true is if P itself is false.\nIf P were true, then \"True implies False\" would be false.\nTherefore, P must be false.\nSo, it must be true that \"Not every rath snicker-snacked Rafin\" (\u00ac\u2200r \u2208 R, S(r, Rafin)).\nThis implies there is at least one rath that did *not* snicker-snack Rafin (\u2203r \u2208 R, \u00acS(r, Rafin)).\n\n**Now let's evaluate each statement:**\n\n**Statement 1: Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n*   We know \"A borogove will whiffle\" (\u2200b \u2208 B, W(b)). This means *any* borogove will whiffle.\n*   However, Zindle and Rafin are not stated to be borogoves. They are likely entities that *can be acted upon* (snicker-snacked, chortled at). They are not explicitly categorized as toves, borogoves, or raths.\n*   The information \"A borogove will whiffle\" tells us about the *property* of borogoves, not about Zindle or Rafin themselves having the property of \"whiffling.\"\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle or Rafin will whiffle.\n\n**Statement 2: A borogove chortled at Zindle if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n*   \"A borogove chortled at Zindle\" (let's call this BZ) is true based on point 5: \"Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\" Since there's at least one borogove, this statement is true.\n*   \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (let's call this NTZ) means \u2200t \u2208 T, \u00acS(t, Zindle).\n*   From point 3, we know \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, S(t, Zindle)). This is equivalent to \"There exists at least one tove that did not snicker-snack Zindle\" (\u2203t \u2208 T, \u00acS(t, Zindle)).\n*   \"No toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (NTZ) is a stronger statement than \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" If NTZ were true, then \u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, S(t, Zindle) would also be true. However, \u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, S(t, Zindle) does *not* imply NTZ. It's possible that *some* toves snicker-snacked Zindle, but not *all* of them.\n*   So, BZ is true. NTZ is not necessarily true; it could be false.\n*   Therefore, \"True if and only if (possibly) False\" is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: A borogove chortled at Zindle just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n*   \"A borogove chortled at Zindle\" (BZ) is true (from point 5).\n*   \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (NTASZ) is true (from point 3).\n*   The statement is \"True just in case True,\" which means \"True if and only if True.\" This is true.\n*   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle won't whiffle.**\n*   As discussed for Statement 1, we have no information about Zindle's ability to whiffle or not whiffle. We only know that borogoves whiffle. Zindle is not identified as a borogove.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude this.\n\n**Statement 5: Zindle will whiffle.**\n*   As discussed for Statement 1, we have no information about Zindle's ability to whiffle.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude this.\n\n**Statement 6: Rafin will whiffle.**\n*   As discussed for Statement 1, we have no information about Rafin's ability to whiffle.\n*   Therefore, we cannot conclude this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze the statements.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) exclusively.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Rath-Rath Snicker-Snack:** Every rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.\n    *   Let 'S' denote the \"snicker-snacked\" relation.\n    *   For every rath `x`, there exists a rath `y` such that `x S y` and `y S x`. This means the snicker-snack relation among raths is symmetric for every pair involved in the \"every rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it\" clause. More precisely, for every rath `x`, there is a rath `y` such that `x S y` and `y S x`. This implies that if `x` snicker-snacked `y`, then `y` snicker-snacked `x` *for that specific pair*.\n4.  **Rath-Tove-Borogove Snicker-Snack:** A rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked a borogove.\n    *   There exists `r` (rath), `t` (tove), `b` (borogove) such that `r S t` and `t S b`.\n5.  **Mimsy-Galumph Conditional:** If every borogove is mimsy, then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n    *   Let `M(x)` be \"x is mimsy\".\n    *   Let `G(x, y)` be \"x galumphed over y\".\n    *   `($\\forall$b $\\in$ B, M(b)) $\\implies$ ($\\neg$G(Zindle, Bungo) $\\iff$ $\\neg$($\\forall$t $\\in$ T, G(t, Bungo)))`\n    *   This simplifies to: `($\\forall$b $\\in$ B, M(b)) $\\implies$ (G(Zindle, Bungo) $\\iff$ ($\\forall$t $\\in$ T, G(t, Bungo)))`\n\n**Analyzing the Rath-Rath Snicker-Snack Condition (Point 3):**\n\n\"Every rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.\"\n\nLet R be the set of raths.\nFor every `x` in R, there exists a `y` in R such that `x S y` and `y S x`.\n\nThis statement directly implies that the snicker-snack relation is *not empty* among raths. If there were no raths snicker-snacking any other rath, this condition could not be met.\n\nLet's consider the statements:\n\n1.  **No raths snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    *   This means for all `x, y` in R, `x` does not `S y`.\n    *   This directly contradicts the given condition \"Every rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it.\" If no rath snicker-snacked a rath, then no rath could snicker-snack a rath that snicker-snacked it.\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 must be false.\n\n2.  **A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This means there exists an `x` in R such that for all `y` in R, `x S y`.\n    *   The given condition (for every `x`, there exists `y` such that `x S y` and `y S x`) does not guarantee this. For example, if R = {r1, r2} and r1 S r2 and r2 S r1, then r1 did not snicker-snack r1, and r2 did not snicker-snack r2 (unless we assume self-snicker-snacking is possible and required, which isn't stated). Even if self-snicker-snacking is allowed, this statement is not necessarily true. Consider R = {r1, r2, r3} where r1 S r2, r2 S r1, r2 S r3, r3 S r2. Here, every rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it. But no single rath snicker-snacked *every* rath.\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  **There is a rath that every rath snicker-snacked.**\n    *   This means there exists a `y` in R such that for all `x` in R, `x S y`.\n    *   Similar to statement 2, the given condition does not guarantee this. Using the example R = {r1, r2} where r1 S r2 and r2 S r1, there is no single rath `y` that both r1 and r2 snicker-snacked (unless r1=r2, which is not the case here).\n    *   Therefore, statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This means for all `x` in R, and for all `y` in R, `x S y`.\n    *   This is a very strong condition. The given condition \"Every rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it\" only requires that for each `x`, there's *at least one* `y` with the symmetric property. It doesn't require `x` to snicker-snack *all* `y`.\n    *   Therefore, statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **A rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    *   This means there exists an `x` in R and there exists a `y` in R such that `x S y`.\n    *   The given condition \"Every rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it\" states that for *every* rath `x`, there exists a `y` such that `x S y` (and `y S x`). Since there is at least one rath (from point 2 of the given information), let's call it `r_0`. Then, according to the condition, `r_0` must snicker-snack some rath `y_0`.\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6.  **No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This means for all `x` in R, it is not the case that `x` snicker-snacked every `y` in R.\n    *   This is the negation of statement 2. Since statement 2 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either. It's possible that there *is* a rath that snicker-snacked every rath (e.g., if there's only one rath, and it snicker-snacked itself).\n    *   Therefore, statement 6 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information, particularly \"Every rath snicker-snacked a rath that snicker-snacked it\" and \"there's at least one of each [rath]\", is that there exists at least one instance of a rath snicker-snacking a rath.\n\nThe information about toves, borogoves, mimsy, Zindle, and Bungo is irrelevant to the question about raths snicker-snacking raths.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

It asserts both \"not all toves will whiffle\" and \"all toves will whiffle\" simultaneously. A contradiction cannot be true.\n*   **Conclusion:** False.\n\n**Statement 2: Bungo snicker-snacked a tove.**\nWe know Bungo is a Borogove.

We cannot deduce this from the given information.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be determined as true.\n\n**Statement 3: Not all toves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\nWe know Bungo is a Borogove. Rule 1 states: \"Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\" Since Bungo is a borogove, it follows that every tove snicker-snacked Bungo.

The given rules only describe actions from toves to borogoves, and from raths to toves. There's no information about borogoves snicker-snacking toves.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be determined as true.\n\n**Statement 6: No toves snicker-snacked Bungo.**\nThis is the direct opposite of Statement 4. Since we determined Statement 4 (\"Every tove snicker-snacked Bungo\") must be true, then this statement (\"No toves snicker-snacked Bungo\") must be false.\n*   **Conclusion:** False.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**4.

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n*   **Premise 1:** Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively). There's at least one of each.\n    *   This means the sets of toves, borogoves, and raths are disjoint and their union covers everything.\n*   **Premise 2:** Zindle gimbled. (This seems to be a distractor, as it doesn't connect to the other statements).\n*   **Premise 3:** Rafin chortled at Rafin if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin.\n    *   Let P be \"Rafin chortled at Rafin\".\n    *   Let Q be \"No raths chortled at Rafin\".\n    *   So, P <=> Q.\n*   **Premise 4:** Rafin chortled at Rafin just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n    *   Let P be \"Rafin chortled at Rafin\".\n    *   Let R be \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\n    *   So, P <=> R.\n\n**Deductions from Premises 3 and 4:**\n\nFrom (P <=> Q) and (P <=> R), we can logically deduce:\nQ <=> R\n\nSubstituting the full phrases:\n\"No raths chortled at Rafin\" <=> \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\"\n\nThis is a crucial derived truth.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: Bungo is a borogove only if every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n*   This is of the form \"If A then B\".\n*   A: \"Bungo is a borogove\"\n*   B: \"Every rath chortled at Rafin\"\n*   We know \"No raths chortled at Rafin\" <=> \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   This statement does not necessarily follow. For example, if Bungo is a tove, the statement doesn't tell us anything about raths chortling. The truth of this statement depends on Bungo's classification and the chortling behavior, which isn't fully determined by the premises.\n\n**Statement 2: Bungo isn't a borogove just in case no raths chortled at Rafin.**\n*   This is of the form \"A <=> B\".\n*   A: \"Bungo isn't a borogove\"\n*   B: \"No raths chortled at Rafin\"\n*   We know \"No raths chortled at Rafin\" <=> \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   This statement claims: \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" <=> \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   This is not necessarily true. If Bungo is a rath, then \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" is true. But \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" could be true or false independently. For instance, if Bungo is a rath, it's possible that *all* borogoves chortled at Bungo (making \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" false), or that *not all* borogoves chortled at Bungo (making it true). The statement doesn't hold.\n\n**Statement 3: No raths chortled at Rafin just in case not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This is of the form \"A <=> B\".\n*   A: \"No raths chortled at Rafin\"\n*   B: \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\"\n*   This is exactly the deduction we made from Premises 3 and 4 (Q <=> R).\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 4: If Bungo is a borogove, then every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n*   This is of the form \"If A then B\".\n*   A: \"Bungo is a borogove\"\n*   B: \"Every rath chortled at Rafin\"\n*   This is the contrapositive of \"If no raths chortled at Rafin, then Bungo is not a borogove\".\n*   We know \"No raths chortled at Rafin\" <=> \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   If Bungo is a borogove, then \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" means that at least one borogove did *not* chortle at Bungo (which is Bungo itself, if Bungo is a borogove and didn't chortle at itself, or another borogove).\n*   However, if Bungo *is* a borogove, then the statement \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" is equivalent to \"There exists at least one borogove (possibly Bungo itself) that did not chortle at Bungo.\"\n*   The statement \"Every rath chortled at Rafin\" is the negation of \"No raths chortled at Rafin\" (assuming \"no raths\" means \"not a single rath\").\n*   Let's re-examine the derived truth: \"No raths chortled at Rafin\" <=> \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   This is equivalent to: \"A rath chortled at Rafin\" <=> \"All borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   This statement (4) says: \"If Bungo is a borogove, then (not 'No raths chortled at Rafin')\".\n*   This does not necessarily follow. If Bungo is a borogove, it doesn't force all raths to chortle at Rafin. For example, if Bungo is a borogove and *all* borogoves chortled at Bungo, then \"No raths chortled at Rafin\" would be false, meaning \"A rath chortled at Rafin\" would be true. But this doesn't mean *every* rath chortled at Rafin. It just means at least one did. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: A borogove chortled at Rafin and Bungo is a rath.**\n*   This statement introduces new information (\"A borogove chortled at Rafin\") and makes a claim about Bungo's classification.\n*   The premises do not provide any information about borogoves chortling at Rafin, nor do they classify Bungo.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: No raths chortled at Rafin if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n*   This is of the form \"A <=> B\".\n*   A: \"No raths chortled at Rafin\"\n*   B: \"A borogove chortled at Bungo\"\n*   We know \"No raths chortled at Rafin\" <=> \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\".\n*   \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" means \"There exists at least one borogove that did not chortle at Bungo.\"\n*   \"A borogove chortled at Bungo\" means \"There exists at least one borogove that *did* chortle at Bungo.\"\n*   These two phrases (\"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" and \"A borogove chortled at Bungo\") are not logically equivalent. For example, if there are two borogoves, B1 and B2, and B1 chortled at Bungo but B2 did not, then both \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" and \"A borogove chortled at Bungo\" would be true. However, if *no* borogoves chortled at Bungo, then \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" is true, but \"A borogove chortled at Bungo\" is false. If *all* borogoves chortled at Bungo, then \"Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo\" is false, but \"A borogove chortled at Bungo\" is true (assuming there's at least one borogove).\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Statement 3 is a direct logical consequence of the given premises.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets and their union covers everything.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Borogove-Rath Relationship:** A borogove galumphed over every rath. (Let G(x,y) mean x galumphed over y). So, for every rath `r`, there exists a borogove `b` such that G(b, r).\n4.  **Rath-Rath Relationship:** Every rath galumphed over a rath. So, for every rath `r1`, there exists a rath `r2` such that G(r1, r2).\n5.  **Bungo:** Bungo is a rath. (Bungo \u2208 R).\n6.  **Whiffling:** No borogoves will whiffle. (Let W(x) mean x will whiffle). So, for all `b` \u2208 B, \u00acW(b).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n*   **Statement 1: Only borogoves will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n    *   \"No borogoves will whiffle\" is directly given (point 6).\n    *   \"Only borogoves will whiffle\" means: If something whiffling, then it is a borogove. (W(x) \u2192 x \u2208 B).\n    *   If \"no borogoves will whiffle\" is true, then for any borogove `b`, \u00acW(b).\n    *   If \"only borogoves will whiffle\" is true, and \"no borogoves will whiffle\" is true, this implies that nothing will whiffle at all. If something whiffling, it must be a borogove, but no borogoves whiffle, so nothing can whiffle. This statement is internally consistent.\n    *   However, the statement itself is a conjunction. We know \"no borogoves will whiffle\" is true. Does \"Only borogoves will whiffle\" *must* be true? Not necessarily. For example, if nothing whiffling at all, then \"Only borogoves will whiffle\" is vacuously true (the antecedent \"something whiffling\" is false). But we don't know if anything *else* whiffling. The problem states \"no borogoves will whiffle\". It doesn't say anything about toves or raths. If a tove whiffling, then \"Only borogoves will whiffle\" would be false. Since we don't know if toves or raths whiffle, we cannot definitively say \"Only borogoves will whiffle\" is true.\n    *   Therefore, the conjunction \"Only borogoves will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle\" does not *must* be true because the first part is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **Statement 2: Every borogove will whiffle.**\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No borogoves will whiffle\" (point 6).\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **Statement 3: A borogove will whiffle.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one borogove that will whiffle.\n    *   This directly contradicts \"No borogoves will whiffle\" (point 6).\n    *   Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **Statement 4: Not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one borogove that will *not* whiffle.\n    *   We are given \"No borogoves will whiffle\" (point 6), which means *all* borogoves will *not* whiffle.\n    *   If all borogoves will not whiffle, then it is certainly true that at least one borogove will not whiffle.\n    *   Since there is at least one borogove (point 2), and that borogove will not whiffle, this statement must be true.\n\n*   **Statement 5: Only borogoves will whiffle.**\n    *   This means: If something whiffling, then it is a borogove. (W(x) \u2192 x \u2208 B).\n    *   As discussed for Statement 1, we know \"no borogoves will whiffle\". This means for any borogove `b`, \u00acW(b).\n    *   If \"Only borogoves will whiffle\" is true, and \"no borogoves will whiffle\" is true, it implies that nothing whiffling at all.\n    *   However, we don't have information about whether toves or raths whiffle. If a tove whiffling, then \"Only borogoves will whiffle\" would be false. Since we don't know, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n*   **Statement 6: Only borogoves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n    *   This is a conjunction.\n    *   We know \"not all borogoves will whiffle\" (the second part) *must* be true (from our analysis of Statement 4).\n    *   However, \"Only borogoves will whiffle\" (the first part) does not *must* be true (from our analysis of Statement 5).\n    *   Since one part of the conjunction does not *must* be true, the entire conjunction does not *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

Let's assume \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (\u00acTSZ) for consistency with P5.\n    *   So, the statement is \u00acTSZ \u2194 (Every B snicker-snacked Bungo).\n    *   This is the same as statement 2.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **cannot be determined** to be true.\n\n5.  **Bungo isn't a borogove just in case not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    *   \"Bungo isn't a borogove\" is \u00acB.\n    *   \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is \u00acTSZ (assuming \"not all\" means \"none\" as in P5).\n    *   So, the statement is \u00acB \u2194 \u00acTSZ.\n    *   This is the same as statement 1.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n6.  **Zindle is mimsy.**\n    *   We know \u00acG \u2192 M. We do not know if \u00acG is true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **cannot be determined** to be true.\n\n**Revisiting the interpretation of \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\":**\n\nIf \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" means \"it is not the case that all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\", this is the negation of \"all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\".\nLet TSZ_all be \"all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\".\nLet \u00acTSZ be \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\".\nP5 states \u00acS \u2194 \u00acTSZ.\n\nIf \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" means \u00ac(TSZ_all), then:\nStatement 4: \u00ac(TSZ_all) \u2194 (Every B snicker-snacked Bungo).\nStatement 5: \u00acB \u2194 \u00ac(TSZ_all).\n\nHowever, P5 uses \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (\u00acTSZ). It's highly probable that \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" in statements 4 and 5 is intended to be synonymous with \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (\u00acTSZ) to maintain consistency with the phrasing in P5. If it meant \"at least one tove did not snicker-snacked Zindle\", then the logical connection would be broken unless we assume there's only one tove, or that \"no toves\" implies \"not all toves\". Given the context of logical reasoning problems, it's standard to assume consistency in phrasing unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nAssuming \"not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is equivalent to \"no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" (\u00acTSZ):\n\n*   Statement 1: \u00acB \u2194 \u00acTSZ. (True, from P4 and P5)\n*   Statement 5: \u00acB \u2194 \u00acTSZ. (True, from P4 and P5)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1, 5}$",

But Rafin isn't beamish.\n*   Therefore, **Rafin cannot be a rath.**\n*   Since only raths are explicitly stated to gimble, and Rafin is not a rath, we have no information to conclude that Rafin gimbled.

It's possible they do, or they don't.\n*   Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Rafin didn't gimble.\n*   This statement does **not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**Statement 5: Rafin and Bungo gimbled.**\n*   Since we couldn't confirm that Rafin gimbled (Statement 2) or Bungo gimbled (Statement 3), this combined statement also does **not necessarily have to be true**.\n\n**Statement 6: Every rath gimbled and Bungo isn't mimsy.**\n*   \"Every rath gimbled\" is true (from given info 4).\n*   \"Bungo isn't mimsy\" is true (from given info 5).\n*   Since both conjuncts are true, the entire statement is **true**.\n\n**Final Check on the Conditional (for completeness, though not directly used for the above statements):**\n\n*   (B_snicker_Rafin) $\\implies$ ( (not R_snicker_R) $\\implies$ (not B_beamish) )\n*   We know \"A rath is beamish\" (from 4). This means there exists at least one beamish rath.\n*   We know \"Rafin isn't beamish\" (from 5).\n*   This conditional doesn't seem to directly impact the truth of the statements about gimbling or mimsiness, given the other direct facts.

There's at least one of each.\n*   **Borogove-Rath Relationship:** A borogove galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it. (If B galumphed over R, then R did not galumph over B). This is a bit tricky. Let's rephrase: If R galumphed over B, then B did *not* galumph over R. Or, if B galumphed over R, then R did *not* galumph over B. The statement \"A borogove galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it\" means: For any B and R, if R galumphed over B, then B galumphed over R. This implies a symmetric relationship for galumphing *in this specific context*. However, the phrasing \"galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it\" is more naturally interpreted as: for any B and R, if R galumphed over B, then B also galumphed over R. This means if a rath galumphs over a borogove, that borogove *must* galumph over that rath.\n*   **Beamish Property:** Only borogoves are beamish. This means: If something is beamish, it is a borogove. Conversely, if something is not a borogove, it is not beamish.\n*   **Tove-Rafin Relationship:** No toves chortled at Rafin. (If X is a tove, then X did not chortle at Rafin).\n*   **Tove-Bungo Implication:** If every tove chortled at Bungo, then not all borogoves galumphed over Bungo.\n*   **Rath-Rafin Implication:** If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Rafin is beamish only if every rath galumphed over Rafin.\n*   **Zindle and Rafin Beamish Status:** Zindle isn't beamish but it is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish.\n\n**Analyzing Zindle and Rafin's Beamish Status:**\n\n*   \"Zindle isn't beamish\": This is straightforward. Zindle is not beamish.\n*   \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish\": This is a double negative, meaning \"Rafin is beamish.\"\n\n**Consequences of Beamish Status:**\n\n*   Since \"Only borogoves are beamish\":\n    *   Because Zindle isn't beamish, Zindle cannot be a borogove. So, Zindle is either a tove or a rath.\n    *   Because Rafin is beamish, Rafin *must* be a borogove.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\nNow let's check each given statement based on our deductions:\n\n1.  **Rafin is a borogove.**\n    *   We deduced that \"Rafin is beamish.\"\n    *   We know \"Only borogoves are beamish.\"\n    *   Therefore, Rafin must be a borogove.\n    *   **This statement must be true.**\n\n2.  **Zindle is beamish.**\n    *   We are explicitly told \"Zindle isn't beamish.\"\n    *   **This statement must be false.**\n\n3.  **Rafin isn't a borogove.**\n    *   We deduced that Rafin is a borogove (from statement 1).\n    *   **This statement must be false.**\n\n4.  **Zindle and Rafin are beamish.**\n    *   We know Zindle isn't beamish.\n    *   For this conjunction to be true, both parts must be true. Since one part is false, the whole statement is false.\n    *   **This statement must be false.**\n\n5.  **Rafin and Zindle are beamish.**\n    *   This is the same as statement 4, just with the order of subjects swapped.\n    *   We know Zindle isn't beamish.\n    *   **This statement must be false.**\n\n6.  **Zindle and Bungo are beamish.**\n    *   We know Zindle isn't beamish.\n    *   For this conjunction to be true, both parts must be true. Since one part is false, the whole statement is false.\n    *   **This statement must be false.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the logical deductions, only statement 1 must be true. The other implications (Tove-Bungo, Rath-Rafin, and the specific galumphing rule) are not needed to determine the truth of these specific statements about Rafin and Zindle's nature and beamish status.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n    *   \"No toves chortled at Rafin\" is directly P1, which is true.\n    *   What about \"Rafin isn't a tove\"?\n        *   If Rafin *were* a tove, say Rafin = $t_R \\in T$.\n        *   Then P1 implies $\\neg ch(t_R, \\text{Rafin})$, which means $\\neg ch(\\text{Rafin}, \\text{Rafin})$.\n        *   This is perfectly consistent. P1 doesn't tell us anything about Rafin's type. Rafin could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n        *   Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Rafin isn't a tove\" must be true.\n    *   Since we cannot conclude \"Rafin isn't a tove\", this entire statement (1) does not *must* be true.\n\n*   **2. Rafin chortled at a tove.**\n    *   This statement is $\\exists t \\in T, ch(\\text{Rafin}, t)$.\n    *   P1 states $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg ch(t, \\text{Rafin})$. This is about toves chortling at Rafin, not Rafin chortling at toves.\n    *   None of the premises provide information about Rafin chortling at anyone, or specifically at a tove.\n    *   We cannot conclude this must be true.\n\n*   **3. Every tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This statement is $\\forall t \\in T, ch(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n    *   This is the direct opposite of P1 (\"No toves chortled at Rafin\").\n    *   Since P1 is given as true, this statement must be false. Therefore, it cannot *must* be true.\n\n*   **4. Not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This statement is $\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, ch(t, \\text{Rafin}))$.\n    *   This is logically equivalent to $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg ch(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n    *   P1 states \"No toves chortled at Rafin\", which is $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg ch(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n    *   If *no* toves chortled at Rafin, then it is certainly true that *not all* toves chortled at Rafin (in fact, zero toves chortled at Rafin).\n    *   This statement is a direct consequence of P1. If P1 is true, then this statement must be true.\n\n*   **5. A tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This statement is $\\exists t \\in T, ch(t, \\text{Rafin})$.\n    *   This is the direct opposite of P1 (\"No toves chortled at Rafin\").\n    *   Since P1 is given as true, this statement must be false. Therefore, it cannot *must* be true.\n\n*   **6. Rafin chortled at every tove.**\n    *   This statement is $\\forall t \\in T, ch(\\text{Rafin}, t)$.\n    *   Similar to statement 2, none of the premises provide information about Rafin chortling at anyone, or specifically at every tove.\n    *   We cannot conclude this must be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct interpretation of the premises, only statement 4 is a logical consequence of P1. The other premises (P2, P3, P4, P5) do not affect the truth value of the statements concerning \"toves chortling at Rafin\" or \"Rafin chortling at toves\".\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

There's at least one of each.\n2.  **Raths & Chortling:** Not all raths chortled at Rafin. (This means there's at least one rath that *didn't* chortle at Rafin, or it means no raths chortled at Rafin. Let's assume it means \"it is not the case that all raths chortled at Rafin\". This implies that the statement \"all raths chortled at Rafin\" is false.)\n3.  **Toves & Chortling:** Every tove chortled at every tove that chortled at every tove. (This is a complex statement about tove behavior, but it doesn't seem directly relevant to the specific individuals mentioned like Bungo, Zindle, or Rafin, unless they are identified as toves.)\n4.  **Bungo & Zindle:** Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle. (Let's denote \"snicker-snacked\" as SS. So, $\\neg (Bungo \\text{ SS } Zindle)$.)\n5.  **Rafin & Bungo:** Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo. (Let's denote \"chortle at\" as C. So, $\\neg (Rafin \\text{ C } Bungo)$.)\n6.  **Bungo & Bungo:** Bungo chortled at Bungo. ($Bungo \\text{ C } Bungo$.)\n7.  **Borogoves & Whiffling:** A borogove will whiffle. (This confirms the existence of borogoves and a property, but doesn't seem directly relevant to the specific individuals.)\n8.  **Borogoves & Gyring:** Every borogove gyred just in case no raths chortled at Rafin. (Let G be \"gyred\". So, $(Every \\text{ B G}) \\iff (\\neg (Some \\text{ R C } Rafin)) \\iff (No \\text{ R C } Rafin)$.\n    From point 2, \"Not all raths chortled at Rafin\" is true. This means it's *not* the case that \"all raths chortled at Rafin\".\n    Let's re-evaluate \"Not all raths chortled at Rafin\". This means $\\neg (\\forall r \\in R, r \\text{ C } Rafin)$. This is equivalent to $\\exists r \\in R, \\neg (r \\text{ C } Rafin)$.\n    Now consider \"no raths chortled at Rafin\". This means $\\forall r \\in R, \\neg (r \\text{ C } Rafin)$.\n    Is \"Not all raths chortled at Rafin\" the same as \"no raths chortled at Rafin\"? No.\n    If \"Not all raths chortled at Rafin\" is true, it means there's at least one rath that *didn't* chortle at Rafin. It doesn't mean *no* raths chortled at Rafin. Some raths *could* have chortled at Rafin, as long as not *all* of them did.\n\n    Let's re-read \"Not all raths chortled at Rafin.\" This means $\\neg (\\forall x \\in R, x \\text{ C } Rafin)$.\n    This is equivalent to $\\exists x \\in R, \\neg (x \\text{ C } Rafin)$.\n\n    Now, let's look at \"Every borogove gyred just in case no raths chortled at Rafin.\"\n    Let P be \"Every borogove gyred\".\n    Let Q be \"no raths chortled at Rafin\". (i.e., $\\forall x \\in R, \\neg (x \\text{ C } Rafin)$).\n    The statement is $P \\iff Q$.\n\n    From (2), we know $\\neg (\\forall x \\in R, x \\text{ C } Rafin)$. This means it's *not* the case that all raths chortled at Rafin.\n    This does *not* directly tell us if \"no raths chortled at Rafin\" (Q) is true or false.\n    If Q is true, then P is true. If Q is false, then P is false.\n\n    Let's consider the implications of \"Not all raths chortled at Rafin\".\n    This means the set of raths that chortled at Rafin is not the entire set of raths.\n    It could be an empty set (no raths chortled at Rafin), or a non-empty proper subset.\n\n    The problem asks what *must* be true.\n\nLet's focus on the specific statements about Bungo and Zindle, as the options revolve around them.\n\nFrom the given information:\n*   **Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle.** ($\\neg (Bungo \\text{ SS } Zindle)$) - This is a direct given fact.\n*   **Bungo chortled at Bungo.** ($Bungo \\text{ C } Bungo$) - This is a direct given fact.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option based on these two established facts. We don't have any information about Zindle snicker-snacking Zindle.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\nLet $A = \\text{\"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\"}$ ($\\neg (Zindle \\text{ SS } Zindle)$)\nLet $B = \\text{\"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\"}$ ($\\neg (Bungo \\text{ C } Bungo)$)\nLet $C = \\text{\"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\"}$ ($\\neg (Bungo \\text{ SS } Zindle)$)\nLet $D = \\text{\"Bungo chortled at Bungo\"}$ ($Bungo \\text{ C } Bungo$)\n\nWe know:\n*   $C$ is true.\n*   $D$ is true.\n*   Therefore, $B$ is false (since $B = \\neg D$).\n\nLet's re-write the options using these simplified variables:\n\n1.  $A \\text{ but it is not the case that } B$. (i.e., $A \\land \\neg B$)\n    Since $B$ is false, $\\neg B$ is true. So this becomes $A \\land \\text{True}$, which simplifies to $A$.\n    We don't know if $A$ (Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle) is true or false. So, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n2.  $D \\text{ but it is not the case that } A$. (i.e., $D \\land \\neg A$)\n    We know $D$ is true. So this becomes $\\text{True} \\land \\neg A$, which simplifies to $\\neg A$.\n    We don't know if $A$ is true or false, so we don't know if $\\neg A$ is true or false. So, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n3.  $C \\text{ but it is not the case that } B$. (i.e., $C \\land \\neg B$)\n    We know $C$ is true. We know $B$ is false, so $\\neg B$ is true.\n    So this becomes $\\text{True} \\land \\text{True}$, which is **True**.\n    This statement *must* be true.\n\n4.  $A \\text{ and } B$. (i.e., $A \\land B$)\n    We know $B$ is false. So this becomes $A \\land \\text{False}$, which is **False**.\n    This statement *must* be false, therefore it cannot *must* be true.\n\n5.  $C \\text{ and } B$. (i.e., $C \\land B$)\n    We know $C$ is true. We know $B$ is false.\n    So this becomes $\\text{True} \\land \\text{False}$, which is **False**.\n    This statement *must* be false, therefore it cannot *must* be true.\n\n6.  $D \\text{ and } A$. (i.e., $D \\land A$)\n    We know $D$ is true. So this becomes $\\text{True} \\land A$, which simplifies to $A$.\n    We don't know if $A$ (Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle) is true or false. So, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true is option 3.\n\nLet's double check the interpretation of \"Not all raths chortled at Rafin\" and \"Every borogove gyred just in case no raths chortled at Rafin\".\nThis part of the problem seems to be a distractor for the specific question asked. The question is about Bungo and Zindle's actions, and the information about raths and borogoves doesn't seem to connect to them in a way that would affect the truth value of the options.\n\nLet's confirm the direct facts:\n*   \"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true.\n*   \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n\nNow let's re-evaluate option 3:\n\"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\"\n\n*   \"Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true (from given info).\n*   \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" is the negation of \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\".\n*   Since \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" is true (from given info), its negation \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" must be false.\n*   \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" is the negation of \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\".\n*   Since \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" is false, \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\" must be true.\n\nSo, option 3 is (True) AND (True), which means it is True.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. There's at least one of each.\n*   **Relationship:** \"chortled at\" (C). We can represent this as a directed relation, e.g., X C Y means X chortled at Y.\n*   **Relationship:** \"galumphed over\" (G). We can represent this as a directed relation, e.g., X G Y means X galumphed over Y.\n\nNow let's translate the given rules into logical statements:\n\n**Rule 1:** Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\n*   For all x, y: if x is B and y is B, then x C y.\n*   This implies that if there are N borogoves, each borogove chortled at itself and at every other borogove.\n\n**Rule 2:** A tove chortled at every rath that chortled at it.\n*   For all t, r: if t is T and r is R, and r C t, then t C r.\n\n**Rule 3:** A tove chortled at a borogove that chortled at a borogove.\n*   There exists a t (T), and there exists a b1 (B), and there exists a b2 (B) such that t C b1 and b1 C b2.\n\n**Rule 4:** Every borogove chortled at every tove that chortled at every borogove.\n*   For all b (B), for all t (T): if (for all b' (B), t C b'), then b C t.\n\n**Rule 5:** A borogove chortled at Zindle just in case not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin.\n*   Let 'b_chortles_Zindle' be \"There exists a b (B) such that b C Zindle\".\n*   Let 'not_all_B_galumphed_Rafin' be \"It is NOT the case that (for all b (B), b G Rafin)\".\n*   So, b_chortles_Zindle <=> not_all_B_galumphed_Rafin.\n\n---\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: No borogoves chortled at a borogove.**\n*   This means: For all x, y: if x is B and y is B, then it is NOT the case that x C y.\n*   This directly contradicts **Rule 1** (\"Every borogove chortled at every borogove\").\n*   Therefore, Statement 1 must be **False**.\n\n**Statement 2: No borogoves chortled at every borogove.**\n*   This means: For all x (B), it is NOT the case that (for all y (B), x C y).\n*   This also directly contradicts **Rule 1** (\"Every borogove chortled at every borogove\").

But by Rule 1, b1 C b2 is true.\n*   This statement contradicts **Rule 1**.\n*   Therefore, Statement 3 must be **False**.\n\n**Statement 4: A borogove chortled at every borogove.**\n*   This means: There exists an x (B) such that (for all y (B), x C y).\n*   **Rule 1** states: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\" This means that *for all* borogoves x, x chortled at every borogove.\n*   If *every* borogove chortled at every borogove, then it is certainly true that *at least one* borogove chortled at every borogove.\n*   Therefore, Statement 4 must be **True**.\n\n**Statement 5: Zindle is a tove.**\n*   **Rule 5** relates whether a borogove chortled at Zindle to whether borogoves galumphed over Rafin. It does not give any information about Zindle's type.\n*   We know Zindle is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n*   There is no information in the rules that forces Zindle to be a tove. For example, if not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin, then some borogove chortled at Zindle. This doesn't tell us Zindle's type. If all borogoves galumphed over Rafin, then no borogove chortled at Zindle. This also doesn't tell us Zindle's type.\n*   Therefore, Statement 5 is not necessarily true. It could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n*   Therefore, Statement 5 must be **False** (not necessarily true).\n\n**Statement 6: There is not a borogove that every borogove chortled at.**\n*   This means: It is NOT the case that (There exists an x (B) such that (for all y (B), y C x)).\n*   Let's re-examine **Rule 1**: \"Every borogove chortled at every borogove.\"\n    *   This means: For all b1 (B), for all b2 (B), b1 C b2.\n*   Now let's consider the negation of Statement 6: \"There is a borogove that every borogove chortled at.\"\n    *   This means: There exists an x (B) such that (for all y (B), y C x).\n*   Let's pick an arbitrary borogove, say 'B_alpha'.\n*   According to Rule 1, *every* borogove (y) chortled at *every* borogove (x). So, every borogove (y) chortled at B_alpha (our chosen x).\n*   This means that the negation of Statement 6 is true.\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 itself must be **False**.\n\n---\n\nSummary of analysis:\n1. False\n2. False\n3. False\n4. True\n5. False\n6. False\n\nThe only statement that must be true is Statement 4.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets, and their union covers everything.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Zindle & Toves:** Zindle chortled at every tove. (Zindle -> T)\n4.  **Toves & Bungo (Part 1):** Not all toves chortled at Bungo. (NOT (All T -> Bungo))\n5.  **Rafin & Zindle:** It is not the case that Rafin chortled at Zindle. (NOT (Rafin -> Zindle))\n6.  **Toves & Bungo (Part 2):** No toves chortled at Bungo. (NOT (Any T -> Bungo))\n7.  **Rafin & Bungo:** It is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo. (NOT (Rafin -> NOT Bungo))\n\n**Simplifying the Given Information:**\n\n*   From (6) \"No toves chortled at Bungo,\" we know that for any tove 't', 't' did not chortle at Bungo.\n*   From (4) \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo,\" this is consistent with (6). If no toves chortled at Bungo, then certainly not all of them did. So (4) is redundant given (6).\n*   From (7) \"It is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo,\" this means Rafin *did* chortle at Bungo. (Rafin -> Bungo)\n\n**Revised Key Information:**\n\n*   T, B, R are disjoint and exhaustive. At least one of each.\n*   Zindle chortled at every tove. (Zindle -> T)\n*   No toves chortled at Bungo. (NOT (Any T -> Bungo))\n*   Rafin did not chortle at Zindle. (NOT (Rafin -> Zindle))\n*   Rafin chortled at Bungo. (Rafin -> Bungo)\n\n---\n\n**Analyzing Each Statement:**\n\n**1. Zindle is a tove.**\n\n*   We know Zindle chortled at every tove. This tells us about Zindle's action, not Zindle's category.\n*   Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n*   For example, if Zindle is a borogove, it can still chortle at every tove.\n*   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**2. A tove chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   We know Zindle chortled at every tove. This is the reverse direction.\n*   We have no information about toves chortling at Zindle.\n*   Consider the possibility that no toves chortled at Zindle. This doesn't contradict any given information.\n*   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**3. Zindle chortled at a tove.**\n\n*   We are given: \"Zindle chortled at every tove.\"\n*   Since there is at least one tove (from the \"existence\" rule), it logically follows that Zindle must have chortled at *at least one* tove.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**4. Not all toves chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   We have no information about toves chortling at Zindle.\n*   It's possible that all toves chortled at Zindle, or some did, or none did.\n*   This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**5. Every tove chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   Similar to statement 4, we have no information to support this.\n*   This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**6. No toves chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   Similar to statement 4, we have no information to support this.\n*   This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is **3.

So, (Every tove is uffish) IF NOT (every borogove chortled at Bungo).\n    *   We know that Bungo is a borogove (since everything is T, B, or R, and Bungo is not explicitly T or R, and the statement \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\" implies Bungo is a creature).\n    *   Since \"It is NOT the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo\", it is *not* true that \"every borogove chortled at Bungo\" (because if every borogove chortled at Bungo, then Bungo, being a borogove, would have chortled at Bungo, which contradicts our given information).\n    *   Therefore, the condition \"every borogove chortled at Bungo\" is false.\n    *   This means \"Every tove is uffish\" must be true.

Rafin will burble.**\n    *   Similar to statement 2, we know \"A borogove will burble\".\n    *   This means *at least one* borogove burbles.

($\\forall$x (B(x) $\\implies$ $\\neg$M(x)))\n\nNow, let's use this deduction with Statement 1:\nStatement 1: ($\\forall$x (B(x) $\\implies$ $\\neg$M(x))) $\\implies$ $\\neg$SS(Bungo, Rafin)\nSince we just deduced that \"no borogoves are mimsy\" is true, the antecedent of Statement 1 is true.\nTherefore, the consequent must be true: $\\neg$SS(Bungo, Rafin) (Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on our deductions:\n\n*   **From Statement 2a:** \"Not all toves will whiffle.\" ($\\neg$$\\forall$x (T(x) $\\implies$ W(x)))\n*   **From Statement 3a:** \"Not all borogoves will whiffle.\" ($\\neg$$\\forall$x (B(x) $\\implies$ W(x)))\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n\n1.  \"Only borogoves will whiffle and not all toves will whiffle.\"\n    *   \"Only borogoves will whiffle\" means $\\forall$x (W(x) $\\implies$ B(x)). This would imply that no toves whiffle, which contradicts \"not all toves will whiffle\" if there are any toves that do whiffle. More importantly, it implies that no raths whiffle. We have no information to confirm this.\n    *   \"Not all toves will whiffle\" is true (from 2a).\n    *   The first part is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  \"Not all toves will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.\"\n    *   \"Not all toves will whiffle\" is true (from 2a).\n    *   \"No borogoves will whiffle\" means $\\forall$x (B(x) $\\implies$ $\\neg$W(x)). This is a stronger statement than \"Not all borogoves will whiffle\" (3a). Statement 3a only tells us that *at least one* borogove does not whiffle, not that *all* borogoves don't whiffle. So, this part is not necessarily true.\n\n3.  \"Not all toves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.\"\n    *   \"Not all toves will whiffle\" is true (from 2a).\n    *   \"Not all borogoves will whiffle\" is true (from 3a).\n    *   Both parts of this statement are directly derived from the given information. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4.  \"Not all borogoves will whiffle and every tove will whiffle.\"\n    *   \"Not all borogoves will whiffle\" is true (from 3a).\n    *   \"Every tove will whiffle\" means $\\forall$x (T(x) $\\implies$ W(x)).

This means the \"snicker-snack\" relationship *among raths* is symmetric.\n*   **Borogove Property:** A borogove is uffish.\n*   **Rath Property:** A rath is uffish.\n*   **Bungo Action:** Bungo chortled at Bungo. (This seems irrelevant to the rath snicker-snack problem).\n*   **Rath/Zindle Action:** A rath galumphed over Zindle. (This also seems irrelevant to the rath snicker-snack problem).\n\n**Focus on the Rath Snicker-Snack Rule:**\n\n\"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\"\nThis is the crucial piece of information. It means that if rath A snicker-snacked rath B, then rath B *must* have snicker-snacked rath A. The relationship is symmetric *within the set of raths*.\n\nLet's denote the set of all raths as $R$.\nThe rule states: $\\forall x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, (S(x, y) \\implies S(y, x))$.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. Every rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n*   This means: $\\forall x \\in R, \\exists y \\in R, S(x, y)$.\n*   Does this *have* to be true? Not necessarily. The rule only tells us about the symmetry *if* a snicker-snack occurs. It doesn't guarantee that any rath snicker-snacked *any* other rath, or even itself. It's possible that no rath snicker-snacked any rath at all. If there are no snicker-snacking events among raths, the condition \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it\" is vacuously true (the \"if\" part is always false, so the implication is true).\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. A rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   This means: $\\exists x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, S(x, y)$.\n*   Similar to statement 1, this is not guaranteed. It's possible no snicker-snacking occurred at all.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. A rath snicker-snacked a rath.**\n*   This means: $\\exists x \\in R, \\exists y \\in R, S(x, y)$.\n*   Again, this is not guaranteed. The rule is about symmetry *if* a snicker-snack happens. It doesn't force any snicker-snacking to happen. It's possible that no rath snicker-snacked any rath.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. Every rath snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   This means: $\\forall x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, S(x, y)$.\n*   This is a very strong claim and is not supported by the given rule. The rule only states symmetry, not universal snicker-snacking.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. No raths snicker-snacked every rath.**\n*   This means: $\\neg (\\exists x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, S(x, y))$. Which is equivalent to: $\\forall x \\in R, \\exists y \\in R, \\neg S(x, y)$.\n*   This is the negation of statement 2. Since statement 2 is not necessarily true, its negation is not necessarily true either. It's possible that one rath *did* snicker-snack every rath (e.g., if there's only one rath, and it snicker-snacked itself, or if there are multiple raths and one snicker-snacked all of them).\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. A rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.**\n*   This means: $\\exists x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, (S(y, x) \\implies S(x, y))$.\n*   Let's compare this to the given rule: \"Every rath snicker-snacked every rath that snicker-snacked it.\"\n    *   The given rule is: $\\forall x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, (S(x, y) \\implies S(y, x))$.\n*   Statement 6 is essentially saying: \"There exists *at least one* rath (let's call it 'x') such that for *any* rath 'y', if 'y' snicker-snacked 'x', then 'x' snicker-snacked 'y'.\"\n*   The given rule states that this property holds for *every* rath 'x'. If it holds for *every* rath, then it *must* hold for *at least one* rath.\n*   Let's rephrase the given rule: For any rath $A$, and any rath $B$, if $A$ snicker-snacked $B$, then $B$ snicker-snacked $A$.\n*   Let's rephrase statement 6: There exists a rath $X$ such that for any rath $Y$, if $Y$ snicker-snacked $X$, then $X$ snicker-snacked $Y$.\n*   The given rule establishes a universal property of the snicker-snack relationship among raths: it is symmetric. If $S(A, B)$ then $S(B, A)$.\n*   Statement 6 is asking if there exists *some* rath $X$ such that for any $Y$, if $S(Y, X)$ then $S(X, Y)$.\n*   Since the given rule states that *for all* raths $A$ and $B$, if $S(A, B)$ then $S(B, A)$, this means the symmetry holds for *any pair* of raths.\n*   Therefore, if we pick *any* rath $X$, it will satisfy the condition in statement 6. Since there is at least one rath (given information), we can pick one, and it will satisfy the condition.\n*   So, yes, if the property holds for *every* rath, it must hold for *at least one* rath.\n\nLet's be very precise.\nGiven: $\\forall a \\in R, \\forall b \\in R, (S(a, b) \\implies S(b, a))$\nStatement 6: $\\exists x \\in R, \\forall y \\in R, (S(y, x) \\implies S(x, y))$\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary rath, say $r_0$, which we know exists because \"there's at least one of each\" (including raths).\nNow, consider the condition $\\forall y \\in R, (S(y, r_0) \\implies S(r_0, y))$.\nIs this true?\nLet $y$ be any rath.\nWe need to show that if $S(y, r_0)$, then $S(r_0, y)$.\nFrom the given rule, we know that for *any* raths $a$ and $b$, if $S(a, b)$ then $S(b, a)$.\nLet $a = y$ and $b = r_0$.\nThen, if $S(y, r_0)$, it must be true that $S(r_0, y)$.\nThis means that the condition $\\forall y \\in R, (S(y, r_0) \\implies S(r_0, y))$ is true for our chosen rath $r_0$.\nSince we found such an $r_0$, statement 6 is true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

The only mention of burbling is that \"A borogove will burble.\" This tells us nothing about Zindle.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n*   From point 2: \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n*   This means for any borogove $x$, $x$ did not snicker-snack Rafin.\n*   This statement says that for every borogove $x$, Rafin snicker-snacked $x$. This is a different relationship.\n*   We have no information about Rafin snicker-snacking *anything*, only about borogoves snicker-snacking Rafin.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n*   From point 2: \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n*   This means that for *every* borogove, it is *not* true that it snicker-snacked Rafin.\n*   If \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true, then it is certainly true that \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\" (In fact, it's stronger: *none* did).\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 4: Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n*   From point 2: \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n*   This statement is the direct opposite of what is given.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Statement 5: A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n*   From point 2: \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n*   This means there does not exist any borogove that snicker-snacked Rafin.\n*   This statement claims that there exists at least one borogove that snicker-snacked Rafin.\n*   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Statement 6: Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n*   Similar to Statement 2, we have no information about Rafin snicker-snacking *anything*, only about borogoves snicker-snacking Rafin.\n*   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe crucial piece of information is \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n\n*   This means: $\\forall x (x \\in B \\implies \\neg \\text{SnickerSnacked}(x, \\text{Rafin}))$\n\nLet's re-evaluate the relevant options based on this:\n\n*   **Statement 3: Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n    *   This can be written as: $\\neg (\\forall x (x \\in B \\implies \\text{SnickerSnacked}(x, \\text{Rafin})))$\n    *   If \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true, it means that for every borogove, it's false that they snicker-snacked Rafin. This directly implies that it's not the case that *all* borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin. If none did, then certainly not all did. This is true.\n\n*   **Statement 4: Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n    *   This can be written as: $\\forall x (x \\in B \\implies \\text{SnickerSnacked}(x, \\text{Rafin}))$\n    *   This is the direct negation of \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" (if we interpret \"No X did Y\" as \"For all X, X did not do Y\"). So, if \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true, then \"Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be false.\n\n*   **Statement 5: A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n    *   This can be written as: $\\exists x (x \\in B \\land \\text{SnickerSnacked}(x, \\text{Rafin}))$\n    *   This is also the direct negation of \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" (if we interpret \"No X did Y\" as \"There does not exist an X that did Y\"). So, if \"No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true, then \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\" must be false.\n\nThe other statements (1, 2, 6) cannot be definitively determined as true or false from the given information.\n\nThe only statement that *must be true* is Statement 3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This tells us that \"galumphed over\" is a possible action.\n\nConsider the possibility that Rafin is a rath. If Rafin is a rath, then according to (4), Rafin (being a rath) galumphed over Rafin. This is possible.\nConsider the possibility that Rafin is a borogove. If Rafin is a borogove, then according to (4), every rath galumphed over Rafin. This is possible.\nConsider the possibility that Rafin is a tove. If Rafin is a tove, then according to (4), every rath galumphed over Rafin. This is possible.\n\nThe information given about raths galumphing over Rafin doesn't restrict Rafin's category.\n\n**About Zindle:**\n\n*   From (7): Not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\n\nThis means there exists at least one tove that did *not* galumph over Zindle.\nThis statement doesn't tell us anything about Zindle's category. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n\nFor example:\n*   If Zindle is a tove: Not all toves galumphed over Zindle (a tove). This is possible.\n*   If Zindle is a borogove: Not all toves galumphed over Zindle (a borogove). This is possible.\n*   If Zindle is a rath: Not all toves galumphed over Zindle (a rath). This is possible.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\nLet's check each given statement against our deductions:\n\n1.  **Zindle isn't a tove.** (Cannot be determined. Zindle could be a tove.)\n2.  **Zindle is a tove.** (Cannot be determined. Zindle could be a borogove or a rath.)\n3.  **Rafin isn't a tove.** (Cannot be determined.

Rafin could be a borogove or a rath.)\n6.  **Bungo isn't a tove.** (True, we deduced this from the contradiction.)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 6 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n*   **Existence:** There is at least one T, at least one B, and at least one R.\n*   **Snicker-snacked (S):** This is a binary relation. \"X snicker-snacked Y\" means X S Y.\n\n**Given Rules:**\n\n1.  **Every borogove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   This means for any $b_1 \\in B$ and any $b_2 \\in B$, $b_1 S b_2$.\n    *   This implies that the \"snicker-snacked\" relation is a **complete graph** within the set of borogoves, including self-snicker-snacking.\n\n2.  **A rath snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked a tove.**\n    *   There exists $r \\in R$, $b \\in B$, and $t \\in T$ such that $r S b$ and $b S t$.\n\n3.  **If Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, then Zindle isn't a borogove.**\n    *   Let $P$ be \"Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin\" ($Rafin S Rafin$).\n    *   Let $Q$ be \"Zindle isn't a borogove\" ($Zindle \\notin B$).\n    *   The rule is $P \\implies Q$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given rules.\n\n**Rule 1: Every borogove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\nThis is the most powerful rule for analyzing statements about borogoves. It means:\n*   If $b_1$ and $b_2$ are borogoves, then $b_1 S b_2$.\n*   If $b$ is a borogove, then $b S b$ (self-snicker-snacking).\n\n---\n\n**Statement 1: No borogoves snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked it.**\n*   This statement claims: For any $b_1, b_2 \\in B$, if $b_2 S b_1$, then $b_1$ did not snicker-snack $b_2$.\n*   From Rule 1, we know that for any $b_1, b_2 \\in B$, $b_1 S b_2$ and $b_2 S b_1$.\n*   So, if $b_2 S b_1$ is true (which it always is for borogoves), then $b_1 S b_2$ must be false according to Statement 1.\n*   But Rule 1 says $b_1 S b_2$ *must* be true.\n*   This creates a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 1 must be **false**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 2: There is not a borogove that every borogove snicker-snacked.**\n*   This statement claims: There is no $b_x \\in B$ such that for all $b_y \\in B$, $b_y S b_x$.\n*   From Rule 1, we know that for any $b_y \\in B$ and any $b_x \\in B$, $b_y S b_x$.\n*   This means that *every* borogove $b_x$ is snicker-snacked by *every* borogove $b_y$.\n*   So, if we pick *any* borogove $b_x$, it *is* true that every borogove snicker-snacked $b_x$.\n*   Therefore, the negation \"There is not a borogove that every borogove snicker-snacked\" must be **false**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 3: No borogoves snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n*   This statement claims: For any $b_1 \\in B$ and any $b_2 \\in B$, $b_1$ did not snicker-snack $b_2$.\n*   From Rule 1, we know that for any $b_1 \\in B$ and any $b_2 \\in B$, $b_1 S b_2$.\n*   This directly contradicts Statement 3.\n*   Therefore, Statement 3 must be **false**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle is a tove.**\n*   We are given the conditional statement: If Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, then Zindle isn't a borogove. ($P \\implies Q$)\n*   We don't know if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin ($P$).\n    *   If Rafin is a borogove, then $Rafin S Rafin$ is true by Rule 1. In this case, $Q$ (Zindle isn't a borogove) must be true. But this doesn't tell us Zindle *is* a tove; Zindle could be a rath.\n    *   If Rafin is a tove or a rath, we don't know if $Rafin S Rafin$ is true or false.\n*   Since we cannot determine the truth value of $P$, we cannot definitively conclude $Q$.\n*   Even if $Q$ were true (Zindle isn't a borogove), Zindle could be a tove *or* a rath.\n*   Therefore, Statement 4 **cannot be determined to be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 5: No borogoves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n*   This statement claims: For any $b_x \\in B$, it is not true that $b_x$ snicker-snacked every borogove.\n*   From Rule 1, we know that for any $b_x \\in B$ and any $b_y \\in B$, $b_x S b_y$.\n*   This means that *every* borogove $b_x$ *did* snicker-snack every borogove $b_y$.\n*   Therefore, the negation \"No borogoves snicker-snacked every borogove\" must be **false**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 6: A borogove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n*   This statement claims: There exists at least one $b_x \\in B$ such that for all $b_y \\in B$, $b_x S b_y$.\n*   From Rule 1, we know that for *every* borogove $b_x$, it snicker-snacked *every* borogove $b_y$.\n*   Since there is at least one borogove (given fact), we can pick any borogove, say $b_1$. By Rule 1, $b_1$ snicker-snacked every borogove.\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 must be **true**.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\n1.  No borogoves snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked it. (False)\n2.  There is not a borogove that every borogove snicker-snacked. (False)\n3.  No borogoves snicker-snacked a borogove. (False)\n4.  Zindle is a tove. (Cannot be determined)\n5.  No borogoves snicker-snacked every borogove. (False)\n6.  A borogove snicker-snacked every borogove. (True)\n\nThe only statement that must be true is Statement 6.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a tove (T), a borogove (B), or a rath (R). There's at least one of each.\n2.  **Raths Gimble:** Every rath gimbled. (R -> Gimbled)\n3.  **Rath Chortling:** No raths chortled at a rath that chortled at it. (This implies a specific relationship, but might not be directly relevant to Rafin's properties unless Rafin is involved in chortling).\n4.  **Rafin's Properties:** \"A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Rafin gimbled.\"\n\nLet's re-evaluate the last point carefully: \"A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Rafin gimbled.\"\nThis sentence structure is a bit ambiguous. It could mean:\n    a) (There exists a rath that is beamish) AND (Rafin did not gimble).\n    b) (If something is a rath and beamish, then it is not the case that Rafin gimbled).\n    c) (Rafin is a rath AND Rafin is beamish) BUT (Rafin did not gimble).\n\nLet's assume the most straightforward interpretation for \"A rath is beamish\" as a general statement about the existence of such a rath, and the \"but\" connects it to the statement about Rafin. So, it's likely:\n(There exists at least one rath that is beamish) AND (Rafin did not gimble).\n\nLet's denote:\n*   R(x): x is a rath\n*   G(x): x gimbled\n*   B(x): x is beamish\n*   Rafin: The individual named Rafin\n\nFrom the given information:\n*   (R(x) -> G(x)) for all x. (Every rath gimbled)\n*   NOT G(Rafin) (It is not the case that Rafin gimbled)\n\nNow, let's combine these two crucial pieces of information:\n1.  If something is a rath, then it gimbled.\n2.  Rafin did *not* gimble.\n\nFrom these two points, we can deduce:\nIf Rafin *were* a rath, then Rafin *would have* gimbled (by rule 1).\nBut we know Rafin *did not* gimble (by rule 2).\nTherefore, Rafin cannot be a rath.\n\nSo, **Rafin isn't a rath** must be true.\n\nNow let's check the other statements based on this deduction and the remaining information.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n1.  **Rafin is beamish.**\n    We know \"A rath is beamish\". This tells us there's at least one beamish rath. It doesn't tell us anything about non-raths being beamish, nor does it directly link Rafin to being beamish. Since we've concluded Rafin isn't a rath, this statement is not necessarily true. Rafin could be beamish or not.\n\n2.  **Rafin gimbled.**\n    The problem explicitly states \"it is not the case that Rafin gimbled.\" So, this statement is false.\n\n3.  **Rafin is a rath.**\n    As deduced above, if Rafin were a rath, Rafin would have gimbled. But Rafin did not gimble. Therefore, Rafin cannot be a rath. So, this statement is false.\n\n4.  **Rafin isn't a rath.**\n    This is the deduction we made. It must be true.\n\n5.  **Rafin isn't beamish.**\n    Similar to statement 1, we don't have enough information to conclude this. We know Rafin isn't a rath. The statement \"A rath is beamish\" doesn't preclude non-raths from being beamish. Rafin could be a beamish tove or a beamish borogove. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is that Rafin isn't a rath.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) exclusively.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Event 1:** Rafin chortled at Zindle (C(Rafin, Zindle)).\n4.  **Event 2:** A rath galumphed over Zindle (G(R, Zindle)). This means there exists at least one rath, say R1, such that G(R1, Zindle).\n5.  **Event 3 (Disjunction):** A borogove galumphed over Rafin (G(B, Rafin)) OR every borogove chortled at Bungo (\u2200b \u2208 B, C(b, Bungo)).\n6.  **Event 4:** Bungo chortled at Zindle (C(Bungo, Zindle)).\n7.  **Event 5:** Not all toves galumphed over Zindle (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, G(t, Zindle)). This means there exists at least one tove, say T1, such that \u00acG(T1, Zindle).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 1: If a rath galumphed over Bungo, then a rath chortled at Zindle.**\n*   This statement is of the form P -> Q.\n*   P: A rath galumphed over Bungo (G(R, Bungo)).\n*   Q: A rath chortled at Zindle (C(R, Zindle)).\n*   We know from the given information (Event 2) that \"A rath galumphed over Zindle\" (G(R, Zindle)). This is a fact.\n*   The statement \"If a rath galumphed over Bungo, then a rath chortled at Zindle\" does not necessarily follow. The premise (G(R, Bungo)) doesn't give us information about raths chortling at Zindle. The conclusion (C(R, Zindle)) is not guaranteed by the premise.\n*   Consider a scenario where a rath galumphed over Bungo, but no rath chortled at Zindle. This is possible.\n*   Therefore, Statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: Bungo chortled at Zindle and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n*   This statement is of the form P AND Q.\n*   P: Bungo chortled at Zindle (C(Bungo, Zindle)). This is given as Event 4.\n*   Q: A rath galumphed over Zindle (G(R, Zindle)). This is given as Event 2.\n*   Since both P and Q are explicitly stated in the given information, their conjunction must be true.\n*   Therefore, Statement 2 **must be true**.\n\n**Statement 3: A rath galumphed over Bungo only if a rath chortled at Zindle.**\n*   This statement is equivalent to: If a rath chortled at Zindle, then a rath galumphed over Bungo. (P only if Q is equivalent to If Q then P).\n*   Let P: A rath galumphed over Bungo (G(R, Bungo)).\n*   Let Q: A rath chortled at Zindle (C(R, Zindle)).\n*   The statement is P -> Q. This is the same as Statement 1.\n*   As established for Statement 1, this is not necessarily true. The fact that a rath galumphed over Zindle (given) does not imply anything about raths chortling at Zindle.\n*   Therefore, Statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Bungo chortled at Bungo and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n*   This statement is of the form P AND Q.\n*   P: Bungo chortled at Bungo (C(Bungo, Bungo)). We have no information about Bungo chortling at himself.\n*   Q: A rath galumphed over Zindle (G(R, Zindle)). This is given as Event 2.\n*   Since we don't know if Bungo chortled at Bungo, the conjunction cannot be guaranteed to be true.\n*   Therefore, Statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: If Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo, then every rath chortled at Bungo only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.**\n*   This is a complex conditional statement: (\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) -> ( (\u2200r \u2208 R, C(r, Bungo)) -> (\u00acG(R, Bungo)) ).\n*   Let's analyze the consequent: ( (\u2200r \u2208 R, C(r, Bungo)) -> (\u00acG(R, Bungo)) ).\n    *   This means: If every rath chortled at Bungo, then no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n    *   This is a conditional statement. We have no information that forces this to be true. For example, it's possible that every rath chortled at Bungo AND some rath galumphed over Bungo.\n*   Since the consequent is not necessarily true, and the antecedent (\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) is also not necessarily true, the entire statement is not necessarily true.\n*   Therefore, Statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n*   This statement is of the form P AND Q.\n*   P: Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo (\u00acC(Bungo, Bungo)). We have no information about Bungo chortling at himself, so we cannot confirm he *didn't*.\n*   Q: A rath galumphed over Zindle (G(R, Zindle)). This is given as Event 2.\n*   Since we don't know if Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo, the conjunction cannot be guaranteed to be true.\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 2 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

No raths chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   This means $\\forall x (R(x) \\implies \\neg C(x, \\text{Rafin}))$.\n    *   We have no information about raths chortling at Rafin.

We don't have enough information to confirm or deny it.\n\n**2.

This means ($P \\implies Q$) AND ($Q \\implies P$).\n    *   Equivalently, ($P \\land Q$) OR ($\\neg P \\land \\neg Q$).\n\n3.  **Borogove Burble and Zindle Mimsy:** A borogove will burble (BB) but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy (NM).\n    *   \"A borogove will burble\" means $\\exists x \\in B, \\text{Burble}(x)$.\n    *   \"it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy\" means $\\neg (\\neg M(\\text{Zindle}))$, which simplifies to $M(\\text{Zindle})$.\n    *   So, ($\\exists x \\in B, \\text{Burble}(x)$) AND $M(\\text{Zindle})$.\n\n4.  **Rath Gyred and Toves Galumphed:** Every rath gyred (RG) and not all toves galumphed over Zindle (NTGZ).\n    *   \"Every rath gyred\" means $\\forall x \\in R, \\text{Gyred}(x)$.\n    *   \"not all toves galumphed over Zindle\" means $\\neg (\\forall x \\in T, \\text{Galumphed}(x, \\text{Zindle}))$, which means $\\exists x \\in T, \\neg \\text{Galumphed}(x, \\text{Zindle})$.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\nFrom (3): \"A borogove will burble\". This means $\\exists x \\in B, \\text{Burble}(x)$.\nThis directly contradicts \"No toves will burble\" (Q) if we assume a connection. Let's re-evaluate the \"just in case\" statement.\n\nFrom (2): \"Every borogove is mimsy just in case no toves will burble.\"\n*   $P$: Every borogove is mimsy. ($\\forall x \\in B, M(x)$)\n*   $Q$: No toves will burble. ($\\forall x \\in T, \\neg \\text{Burble}(x)$)\n*   $P \\iff Q$.\n\nFrom (3): \"A borogove will burble\". This means $\\neg Q$ (it's not true that no toves will burble, because if a borogove burbles, it implies that the condition for Q is not met).\nWait, this is a common point of confusion. \"A borogove will burble\" ($\\exists x \\in B, \\text{Burble}(x)$) does *not* directly contradict \"No toves will burble\" ($\\forall x \\in T, \\neg \\text{Burble}(x)$). These are statements about different categories of creatures.\n\nLet's re-read (3) carefully: \"A borogove will burble but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.\"\n*   Part A: $\\exists b \\in B, \\text{Burble}(b)$. (At least one borogove burbles)\n*   Part B: $\\neg (\\neg M(\\text{Zindle})) \\implies M(\\text{Zindle})$. (Zindle is mimsy)\n\nNow, let's use (2) and (3A).\nFrom (3A): $\\exists b \\in B, \\text{Burble}(b)$.\nThis means it is *not* true that \"Every borogove is mimsy\" (P) *if* \"mimsy\" and \"burble\" are related in a way that a mimsy borogove cannot burble. But the problem doesn't state that.\n\nLet's re-evaluate (2): \"Every borogove is mimsy (P) just in case no toves will burble (Q).\"\nSo, $P \\iff Q$.\nThis means:\n(a) If every borogove is mimsy, then no toves will burble.\n(b) If no toves will burble, then every borogove is mimsy.\n(c) If it's *not* true that every borogove is mimsy ($\\neg P$), then it's *not* true that no toves will burble ($\\neg Q$).\n(d) If it's *not* true that no toves will burble ($\\neg Q$), then it's *not* true that every borogove is mimsy ($\\neg P$).\n\nFrom (3A): \"A borogove will burble.\" ($\\exists b \\in B, \\text{Burble}(b)$).\nThis statement does *not* directly tell us anything about P (\"Every borogove is mimsy\") or Q (\"No toves will burble\"). It's a statement about a specific action of a borogove.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of the problem. It's about logical deduction.\n\n**Let's list the established facts:**\n\n*   F1: T, B, R are disjoint, exhaustive categories, each with at least one member.\n*   F2: $P \\iff Q$, where $P = (\\forall x \\in B, M(x))$ and $Q = (\\forall x \\in T, \\neg \\text{Burble}(x))$.\n*   F3: $\\exists b \\in B, \\text{Burble}(b)$. (A borogove burbles)\n*   F4: $M(\\text{Zindle})$. (Zindle is mimsy)\n*   F5: $\\forall r \\in R, \\text{Gyred}(r)$. (Every rath gyred)\n*   F6: $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg \\text{Galumphed}(t, \\text{Zindle})$. (Not all toves galumphed over Zindle)\n\n**Now, let's analyze the implications of F2 and F3.**\n\nFrom F3: \"A borogove will burble.\" This means that the statement \"No borogoves will burble\" is false.\nThis does *not* directly relate to P or Q.\n\nLet's re-read (2) and (3) very carefully.\n(2) \"Every borogove is mimsy just in case no toves will burble.\"\n(3) \"A borogove will burble but it is not the case that Zindle isn't mimsy.\"\n\nThe key is that \"A borogove will burble\" (from 3) is a statement about *some* borogove.\nThe statement \"Every borogove is mimsy\" (P from 2) is about *all* borogoves.\nThe statement \"No toves will burble\" (Q from 2) is about *all* toves.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that \"burble\" and \"mimsy\" are related for borogoves. The problem does not state this.\nThe problem states \"A borogove will burble\". This is a fact.\n\nLet's look at the options and see if we can deduce them.\n\n**What do we know about Zindle?**\nFrom F4: Zindle is mimsy ($M(\\text{Zindle})$).\nFrom F1: Zindle must be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n\n**Let's test the implications of F2 ($P \\iff Q$) and F3 ($\\exists b \\in B, \\text{Burble}(b)$ and $M(\\text{Zindle})$).**\n\nConsider the statement $P$: \"Every borogove is mimsy.\"\nConsider the statement $Q$: \"No toves will burble.\"\n\nIf $P$ is true, then all borogoves are mimsy.\nIf $P$ is false, then at least one borogove is not mimsy.\n\nIf $Q$ is true, then no toves burble.\nIf $Q$ is false, then at least one tove burbles.\n\nFrom F3: \"A borogove will burble.\" This is a specific event. It does not directly tell us about P or Q.\n\nLet's assume Zindle is a borogove.\nIf Zindle is a borogove, then Zindle is mimsy (F4). This is consistent with P being true or false.\nIf Zindle is a borogove, and \"A borogove will burble\" (F3) refers to Zindle, then Zindle burbles.\n\nLet's assume Zindle is a tove.\nIf Zindle is a tove, then Zindle is mimsy (F4).\nIf Zindle is a tove, and Zindle burbles, then Q (\"No toves will burble\") is false.\nIf Q is false, then P (\"Every borogove is mimsy\") must also be false (due to $P \\iff Q$).\nIf P is false, then there exists at least one borogove that is not mimsy.\n\nLet's assume Zindle is a rath.\nIf Zindle is a rath, then Zindle is mimsy (F4).\nFrom F5: Every rath gyred. So, if Zindle is a rath, Zindle gyred.\n\n**Let's re-examine the \"A borogove will burble\" part.**\nThis is a definite fact. $\\exists b \\in B, \\text{Burble}(b)$.\n\nConsider the statement $Q$: \"No toves will burble.\"\nConsider the statement $\\neg Q$: \"At least one tove will burble.\"\n\nConsider the statement $P$: \"Every borogove is mimsy.\"\nConsider the statement $\\neg P$: \"At least one borogove is not mimsy.\"\n\nWe have $P \\iff Q$. This means $\\neg P \\iff \\neg Q$.\n\nFrom F3: \"A borogove will burble\". This is a fact about borogoves. It does not directly relate to toves or the mimsiness of borogoves.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the problem implies a relationship between \"burble\" and \"mimsy\" for borogoves. It does not state it.\nIf a borog",

(This is the same as point 2, reinforcing B \u2192 U).\n6.  **Conditional Statement:** If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin (\u00acC(Zindle, Rafin)), then every borogove chortled at Bungo (\u2200b\u2208B, C(b, Bungo)) only if no raths galumphed over Bungo (\u00ac\u2203r\u2208R, G(r, Bungo)).\n    *   Let P = \u00acC(Zindle, Rafin)\n    *   Let Q = \u2200b\u2208B, C(b, Bungo)\n    *   Let R = \u00ac\u2203r\u2208R, G(r, Bungo)\n    *   The statement is: P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R)\n\n**Analyzing the Given Information:**\n\n*   From (2) and (5): **Every borogove is uffish.** (B \u2192 U)\n*   From (3): **Rafin chortled at Bungo.** (C(Rafin, Bungo))\n*   From (4): **A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.** (S(R, Z))\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: A borogove is uffish and a rath snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n\n*   \"A borogove is uffish\": This is directly stated in (2) and (5). It is true.\n*   \"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle\": This is directly stated in (4). It is true.\n*   Since both parts are true, the conjunction is true.\n*   **Therefore, Statement 1 must be true.**\n\n**Statement 2: A rath is uffish and every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n\n*   \"A rath is uffish\": We know borogoves are uffish, but there's no information given about raths being uffish. It's possible, but not necessarily true.\n*   \"Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle\": We know a rath snicker-snacked Zindle, but there's no information about borogoves snicker-snacking Zindle.\n*   Since we cannot confirm either part, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Zindle is uffish.**\n\n*   We know borogoves are uffish. We know a rath snicker-snacked Zindle. We have no information linking Zindle to being uffish. Zindle could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. If Zindle is a borogove, then Zindle is uffish. But Zindle could be a tove or a rath, in which case we don't know if Zindle is uffish.\n*   **Therefore, Statement 3 does not must be true.**\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle and Rafin are uffish.**\n\n*   \"Zindle is uffish\": As discussed for Statement 3, this is not necessarily true.\n*   \"Rafin is uffish\": We know Rafin chortled at Bungo. We have no information linking Rafin to being uffish. Rafin could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. If Rafin is a borogove, then Rafin is uffish. But we don't know.\n*   Since neither part is necessarily true, the conjunction is not necessarily true.\n*   **Therefore, Statement 4 does not must be true.**\n\n**Statement 5: Zindle and Bungo are uffish.**\n\n*   \"Zindle is uffish\": Not necessarily true (as discussed).\n*   \"Bungo is uffish\": We know Rafin chortled at Bungo. We have no information linking Bungo to being uffish. Bungo could be a tove, a borogove, or a rath. If Bungo is a borogove, then Bungo is uffish. But we don't know.\n*   Since neither part is necessarily true, the conjunction is not necessarily true.\n*   **Therefore, Statement 5 does not must be true.**\n\n**Statement 6: Zindle isn't uffish.**\n\n*   This is the negation of Statement 3. Since Statement 3 does not *must* be true, its negation also does not *must* be true. Zindle *could* be uffish (if Zindle is a borogove).\n*   **Therefore, Statement 6 does not must be true.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe only statement that is directly supported by the given facts is Statement 1. The conditional statement (point 6 in the given information) is complex, but we don't have enough information to determine the truth value of its components (P, Q, R) or to derive any new necessary truths from it. For example, we don't know if Zindle chortled at Rafin or not, or if borogoves chortled at Bungo, or if raths galumphed over Bungo. The question asks what *must* be true, meaning it's true in all possible interpretations of the situation consistent with the given facts.\n\nThe information \"A borogove is uffish\" and \"every borogove is uffish\" are redundant but confirm that property.\nThe information \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" definitively means \"Rafin chortled at Bungo\".\nThe information \"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" is a direct fact.\n\nStatement 1 combines two of these direct facts.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

These are exclusive and there's at least one of each.\n*   **Relationship:** \"galumphed over\" (G).\n*   **Properties:** \"uffish\" (U), \"mimsy\" (M).\n*   **Specific Entity:** \"Rafin\" (let's assume Rafin is a specific entity, possibly a borogove or a rath, but not a tove, as the statement \"every tove galumphed over Rafin\" implies Rafin is distinct from the toves doing the galumphing).\n\n**Given Premises:**\n\n1.  **\"Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\"**\n    *   This means $T \\cup B \\cup R = Universe$\n    *   $T \\cap B = \\emptyset$, $T \\cap R = \\emptyset$, $B \\cap R = \\emptyset$\n    *   $|T| \\ge 1$, $|B| \\ge 1$, $|R| \\ge 1$\n\n2.  **\"A tove galumphed over every borogove.\"**\n    *   This means $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, t \\text{ G } b$.\n    *   Let's call this specific tove $t_0$. So, $t_0$ G $b$ for all $b \\in B$.\n\n3.  **\"No toves are uffish or every tove galumphed over Rafin.\"**\n    *   This is a disjunction: $(\\forall t \\in T, \\neg U(t))$ OR $(\\forall t \\in T, t \\text{ G } Rafin)$.\n\n4.  **\"Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves galumphed over Rafin.\"**\n    *   This is a biconditional: $(\\forall b \\in B, M(b)) \\iff \\neg (\\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ G } Rafin)$.\n    *   This can be rephrased as: $(\\forall b \\in B, M(b)) \\iff (\\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } \\neg (b \\text{ G } Rafin))$.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the premises.\n\n**Statement 1: \"A tove galumphed over a borogove.\"**\n*   From Premise 2: \"A tove galumphed over every borogove.\" This directly implies that there exists at least one tove ($t_0$) that galumphed over *every* borogove. If $t_0$ galumphed over *every* borogove, it certainly galumphed over *a* borogove (since there's at least one borogove, $|B| \\ge 1$).\n*   **Must be true.**\n\n**Statement 2: \"Every tove galumphed over every borogove.\"**\n*   Premise 2 states: \"A tove galumphed over every borogove.\" This means $\\exists t_0 \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, t_0 \\text{ G } b$.\n*   This does *not* mean that *every* tove galumphed over every borogove. There could be other toves ($t_1 \\ne t_0$) that did not galumph over any borogove, or only some borogoves.\n*   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Statement 3: \"No toves galumphed over every borogove.\"**\n*   This is the negation of Premise 2. Premise 2 states \"A tove galumphed over every borogove,\" which means $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, t \\text{ G } b$.\n*   Therefore, \"No toves galumphed over every borogove\" (which means $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, t \\text{ G } b)$ or $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } \\neg (t \\text{ G } b)$) must be false.\n*   **Must be false.** (And thus, not true).\n\n**Statement 4: \"No toves galumphed over a borogove.\"**\n*   This means $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\neg (t \\text{ G } b)$.\n*   This directly contradicts Statement 1, which we determined must be true. If \"A tove galumphed over a borogove\" is true, then \"No toves galumphed over a borogove\" must be false.\n*   **Must be false.** (And thus, not true).\n\n**Statement 5: \"There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.\"**\n*   This statement is about borogoves galumphing over toves, specifically: $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ such that } \\forall b \\in B, b \\text{ G } t$.\n*   The premises only tell us about toves galumphing over borogoves (Premise 2: \"A tove galumphed over every borogove\"). There is no information given about the reverse relationship.\n*   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Statement 6: \"Every tove galumphed over a borogove.\"**\n*   This means $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ such that } t \\text{ G } b$.\n*   Premise 2 states: \"A tove galumphed over every borogove.\" This guarantees that *at least one* tove ($t_0$) galumphed over *every* borogove, and thus over *a* borogove.\n*   However, it does not guarantee that *every* tove galumphed over *a* borogove. There could be a tove $t_1$ that did not galumph over any borogove.\n*   **Not necessarily true.**\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\n*   Statement 1: Must be true.\n*   Statement 2: Not necessarily true.\n*   Statement 3: Must be false.\n*   Statement 4: Must be false.\n*   Statement 5: Not necessarily true.\n*   Statement 6: Not necessarily true.\n\nThe information about \"uffish,\" \"Rafin,\" and \"mimsy\" was not needed to evaluate these specific statements.

Since we have no information about Zindle or Bungo's nature, this statement is likely a distractor for the current problem.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's denote \"X snicker-snacked Y\" as S(X, Y).\n\n*   **Given:** For every r in R, there exists a t in T such that S(r, t). This means every rath snicker-snacked *at least one* tove.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n1.  **Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.** (For every t in T, and for every r in R, S(t, r)).\n    *   The given information states that *every rath* snicker-snacked *a tove*. It says nothing about toves snicker-snacking raths. This statement is not supported and is likely false.\n\n2.  **Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.** (For every t in T, there exists an r in R such that S(t, r)).\n    *   Again, the given information is about raths snicker-snacking toves, not the other way around. This statement is not supported.\n\n3.  **A tove snicker-snacked a rath.** (There exists a t in T, and there exists an r in R such that S(t, r)).\n    *   Similar to 1 and 2, the given information does not support any tove snicker-snacking any rath.\n\n4.  **A rath snicker-snacked a tove.** (There exists an r in R, and there exists a t in T such that S(r, t)).\n    *   The given information states: \"Every rath snicker-snacked a tove.\" Since there is at least one rath, this implies that *at least one* rath snicker-snacked *at least one* tove. This statement is a direct consequence of the given information. If *every* rath did it, then *a* rath certainly did it.\n\n5.  **No toves snicker-snacked every rath.** (It is not the case that there exists a t in T such that for every r in R, S(t, r)).\n    *   We have no information about toves snicker-snacking raths at all. We cannot confirm or deny this statement based on the given information. It's possible no toves snicker-snacked any rath, which would make this true. It's also possible one tove snicker-snacked every rath, which would make this false. We don't know.\n\n6.  **A tove snicker-snacked every rath.** (There exists a t in T such that for every r in R, S(t, r)).\n    *   This is the opposite of what we know (raths snicker-snacking toves). This is not supported by the given information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that is directly and necessarily true based on the provided information is statement 4. The statement \"Every rath snicker-snacked a tove\" implies that there is at least one rath (because there's at least one of each category) and that this rath (and all others) performed the action. Therefore, \"A rath snicker-snacked a tove\" must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(This seems irrelevant to the chortling relationships between B and R).\n*   **Borogove-Rath Chortling Rule 1:** Every borogove chortled at every rath that chortled at it.\n    *   Let `b` be a borogove and `r` be a rath.\n    *   If `r` chortled at `b` (rCb), then `b` chortled at `r` (bCr).\n    *   This applies to *every* borogove.\n*   **Borogove Whiffle:** A borogove will whiffle. (Irrelevant to chortling).\n*   **Borogove-Zindle Chortling Rule:** Every borogove chortled at Zindle. (Zindle's type is not specified, and this is irrelevant to chortling between B and R).\n\n**Focus on the core relationship:** \"Every borogove chortled at every rath that chortled at it.\"\n\nLet's represent the chortling relationship as `X C Y` meaning X chortled at Y.\n\nThe rule states: For any borogove `b` and any rath `r`, if `r C b`, then `b C r`.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**1. A borogove chortled at every rath.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one borogove, let's call it `b1`, such that for every rath `r`, `b1 C r`.\n    *   The given rule only tells us about the *reciprocal* chortling: if `r C b`, then `b C r`. It doesn't guarantee that any borogove chortles at *every* rath, especially if some raths don't chortle at any borogove.\n    *   Consider a scenario: Borogoves = {B1}, Raths = {R1, R2}.\n        *   If R1 chortled at B1 (R1 C B1), then B1 chortled at R1 (B1 C R1).\n        *   If R2 did *not* chortle at B1 (not R2 C B1), then the rule doesn't say anything about B1 chortling at R2. B1 might not chortle at R2.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. A borogove chortled at every rath that chortled at it.**\n    *   This statement is a rephrasing of the given rule, but with \"A borogove\" instead of \"Every borogove\".\n    *   The original rule is: \"Every borogove chortled at every rath that chortled at it.\"\n    *   If *every* borogove has this property, then it must be true that *a* (at least one) borogove has this property.\n    *   This statement is a direct consequence of the given information.\n\n**3. Every borogove chortled at every rath.**\n    *   This means for every borogove `b`, and for every rath `r`, `b C r`.\n    *   Similar to statement 1, the given rule only establishes a conditional relationship (`r C b` implies `b C r`). It does not force every borogove to chortle at every rath.\n    *   If there's a rath `r` that doesn't chortle at any borogove, then no borogove is required to chortle at `r` by the given rule.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. A borogove chortled at a rath.**\n    *   This means there exists at least one borogove `b` and at least one rath `r` such that `b C r`.\n    *   The given rule is conditional: `r C b` implies `b C r`.\n    *   We are told there's at least one borogove and at least one rath.\n    *   However, the rule doesn't guarantee that *any* rath chortles at *any* borogove, which would then trigger the reciprocal chortling. It's possible that no rath chortles at any borogove, in which case no borogove would be *forced* to chortle at any rath by this rule.\n    *   The problem does not provide any information that guarantees an initial chortling event between a rath and a borogove.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**5. Every borogove chortled at a rath.**\n    *   This means for every borogove `b`, there exists at least one rath `r` such that `b C r`.\n    *   Similar to statement 4, this requires some chortling to occur. If no rath chortles at any borogove, then no borogove is required to chortle at any rath.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**6. No borogoves chortled at every rath.**\n    *   This is the negation of statement 1.\n    *   Since statement 1 is not necessarily true, its negation is also not necessarily true. It could be true, or it could be false.\n    *   For example, if there's only one rath, and a borogove chortles at it, then that borogove chortled at *every* rath. In this case, statement 6 would be false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 2, as it is a direct restatement (or a weaker form that is implied by the stronger given statement) of one of the core rules.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

That rule states that for every rath, there's a tove that snicker-snacked *it*. So, at least some toves *do* snicker-snack raths.\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 is **False**.\n\n2.  **A tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    *   From the \"Rath-Tove Snicker-Snack\" rule: \"Every rath (x) snicker-snacked a tove (y) that snicker-snacked x.\"\n    *   Since there's at least one rath (let's call it R1), there must exist a tove (T1) such that T1 snicker-snacked R1.\n    *   This statement is a direct consequence of the rule and the existence of at least one rath.\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 is **True**.\n\n3.  **Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   The rule states: \"For every rath (R_x), there exists *a* tove (T_y) that snicker-snacked R_x.\" It does *not* say that *every* tove snicker-snacked R_x, nor does it say that T_y snicker-snacked *every* rath.\n    *   Consider a scenario: Rath R1 is snicker-snacked by Tove T1. Rath R2 is snicker-snacked by Tove T2. T1 might not snicker-snack R2, and T2 might not snicker-snack R1. Also, there might be a Tove T3 that doesn't snicker-snack any rath (as long as every rath is snicker-snacked by *some* tove).\n    *   This statement is too strong and not necessarily true.\n    *   Therefore, statement 3 is **False**.\n\n4.  **No toves snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This statement claims that for any given tove, it's not true that it snicker-snacked *every* rath.\n    *   The rule states: \"For every rath (R_x), there exists *a* tove (T_y) that snicker-snacked R_x.\"\n    *   It's possible that there's only one tove (T1) and one rath (R1). In this case, T1 snicker-snacked R1. If there's only one rath, then T1 *did* snicker-snack *every* rath (because R1 is the only rath). In this specific scenario, statement 4 would be false.\n    *   Since we can construct a scenario where it's false, it does not *must* be true.\n    *   Therefore, statement 4 is **False**.\n\n5.  **Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    *   The rule states: \"For every rath (R_x), there exists *a* tove (T_y) that snicker-snacked R_x.\" This tells us about raths being snicker-snacked by *some* tove.\n    *   It does *not* say that *every* tove participates in this snicker-snacking. There could be a tove (T_extra) that doesn't snicker-snack any rath, as long as all raths are covered by other toves.\n    *   For example, if R1 is snicker-snacked by T1, and R2 is snicker-snacked by T2. T3 exists but doesn't snicker-snack any rath. This is consistent with the rule. In this case, statement 5 would be false.\n    *   Therefore, statement 5 is **False**.\n\n6.  **A tove snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    *   This statement claims there exists at least one tove (T_x) such that T_x snicker-snacked *all* raths.\n    *   The rule states: \"For every rath (R_x), there exists *a* tove (T_y) that snicker-snacked R_x.\" This T_y can be different for different R_x.\n    *   It's possible that T1 snicker-snacked R1, and T2 snicker-snacked R2, and no single tove snicker-snacked both R1 and R2.\n    *   This statement is not necessarily true.\n    *   Therefore, statement 6 is **False**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only statement that *must* be true based on the given information is statement 2. The information about Rafin, Zindle, Bungo, and galumphing appears to be irrelevant to the snicker-snacking relationship between toves and raths, which is the focus of the options.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and deduce the truth about \"uffishness\" for borogoves.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is exclusively a tove (T), a borogove (B), or a rath (R). There's at least one of each.\n2.  **Rafin:** Rafin is a borogove (R $\\in$ B).\n3.  **Snicker-snack Rule:** Every borogove (b) snicker-snacked every tove (t) that snicker-snacked every rath (r). This can be written as:\n    For any b $\\in$ B, for any t $\\in$ T, for any r $\\in$ R:\n    If (t snicker-snacked r), then (b snicker-snacked t).\n4.  **Uffishness of Rath:** A rath is uffish (R $\\implies$ Uffish).\n5.  **Uffishness of Rafin:** It is *not* the case that Rafin is uffish ($\\neg$ (Rafin is Uffish)).\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n*   From (2) Rafin is a borogove, and from (5) Rafin is not uffish.\n*   Therefore, there exists at least one borogove (Rafin) that is *not* uffish.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n*   **1. A borogove is uffish and every borogove is uffish.**\n    *   We know Rafin is a borogove and is not uffish. So, \"every borogove is uffish\" is false.\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 is false.\n\n*   **2. Only borogoves are uffish.**\n    *   From (4), a rath is uffish. Since raths are distinct from borogoves (exclusive categories), this means something *other* than a borogove (a rath) can be uffish.\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 is false.\n\n*   **3. No borogoves are uffish.**\n    *   We only know that *Rafin* (a specific borogove) is not uffish. We don't have enough information to conclude that *no* borogoves are uffish. There could be other borogoves that *are* uffish. The snicker-snack rule and rath's uffishness don't directly tell us about the uffishness of *all* borogoves.\n    *   Therefore, statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **4. A borogove is uffish.**\n    *   We know Rafin is a borogove and is *not* uffish. This statement claims that *at least one* borogove *is* uffish. We don't have information to confirm this. It's possible Rafin is the only borogove, or all borogoves are like Rafin.\n    *   Therefore, statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **5. Not all borogoves are uffish.**\n    *   We know Rafin is a borogove.\n    *   We know Rafin is *not* uffish.\n    *   If there is at least one borogove (Rafin) that is not uffish, then it logically follows that it is *not* the case that *all* borogoves are uffish.\n    *   Therefore, statement 5 must be true.\n\n*   **6. Every borogove is uffish.**\n    *   We know Rafin is a borogove and is *not* uffish. This directly contradicts \"Every borogove is uffish.\"\n    *   Therefore, statement 6 is false.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is \"Not all borogoves are uffish.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This means **not all raths will whiffle**.\nLet's call this fact (A): $\\neg (\\forall x (R(x) \\implies W(x)))$.\n\nNow, look at statement 3: $(\\forall x (R(x) \\implies W(x))) \\lor (\\forall x (T(x) \\implies U(x)))$.\nSince (A) is true (not all raths will whiffle), the first part of the disjunction is false.\nTherefore, the second part must be true: $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies U(x))$.\nThis means **Every tove is uffish**.\n\nLet's call this fact (B): $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies U(x))$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on fact (B):\n\n*   **1. A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.**\n    *   This is a contradiction (P and not P). It can never be true. So, this is false.\n\n*   **2. Every tove is uffish.**\n    *   This is exactly fact (B), which we deduced must be true.\n\n*   **3. No toves are uffish.**\n    *   This means $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg U(x))$.\n    *   This directly contradicts fact (B) which states $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies U(x))$, unless there are no toves. But we are told there is at least one tove.\n    *   If there's at least one tove, say T1, then from (B), T1 is uffish. From \"No toves are uffish\", T1 is not uffish. Contradiction.\n    *   So, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **4. Zindle will whiffle.**\n    *   We know Zindle is either a tove, borogove, or rath.\n    *   If Zindle is a tove, we know toves are uffish, but we don't know if toves whiffle.\n    *   If Zindle is a borogove, we know nothing about borogoves whiffing.\n    *   If Zindle is a rath, we know not all raths whiffle, so Zindle might or might not whiffle.\n    *   We also have statement 4: $(\\neg B(Zindle)) \\lor (\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg U(x)))$.\n    *   We know from (B) that $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies U(x))$. This means $\\neg (\\forall x (T(x) \\implies \\neg U(x)))$ (assuming there's at least one tove, which there is).\n    *   So, the second part of the disjunction in statement 4 is false.\n    *   Therefore, the first part must be true: $\\neg B(Zindle)$. This means **Zindle is not a borogove**.\n    *   So Zindle is either a tove or a rath.\n    *   However, knowing Zindle is not a borogove does not tell us if Zindle will whiffle. We have no information linking toves or raths (specifically Zindle) to whiffle, other than \"not all raths whiffle\".\n    *   So, we cannot determine if Zindle will whiffle. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **5. Not all toves are uffish.**\n    *   This means $\\neg (\\forall x (T(x) \\implies U(x)))$.\n    *   This directly contradicts fact (B) which states $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies U(x))$.\n    *   So, this statement must be false.\n\n*   **6. Only toves are uffish.**\n    *   This means $\\forall x (U(x) \\implies T(x))$.\n    *   We know $\\forall x (T(x) \\implies U(x))$ (Fact B).\n    *   However, we don't know if things that are uffish must be toves. For example, a rath could be uffish. The information doesn't preclude this.\n    *   So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the deductions, only statement 2, \"Every tove is uffish,\" must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Rath-Borogove Interaction:** Every rath chortled at a borogove. (Let C(x, y) mean x chortled at y). So, for every rath r, there exists a borogove b such that C(r, b).\n*   **Rafin:** Rafin isn't a tove.\n*   **Rath-Zindle Interaction:** A rath galumphed over Zindle. (Let G(x, y) mean x galumphed over y). So, there exists a rath r' such that G(r', Zindle).\n*   **Zindle:** Zindle isn't a borogove unless every tove snicker-snacked Zindle. (Let S(x, y) mean x snicker-snacked y). This is a conditional statement: If Zindle is a borogove, then every tove snicker-snacked Zindle. Or, equivalently, if not (every tove snicker-snacked Zindle), then Zindle is not a borogove.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's focus on the \"Every rath chortled at a borogove\" rule, as it's the most relevant to the chortling statements.\n\nThe rule states: For every rath *r*, there exists *at least one* borogove *b* such that *r* chortled at *b*.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1.  **No borogoves chortled at every rath.**\n    *   This statement is about borogoves chortling at raths. The given information is about raths chortling at borogoves.\n    *   The given information doesn't preclude a borogove from chortling at every rath. For example, if there's only one rath (R1) and one borogove (B1), and R1 chortled at B1 (satisfying the rule), it's still possible that B1 also chortled at R1. If there are multiple raths, it's possible that a specific borogove chortled at all of them.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n2.  **A borogove chortled at every rath.**\n    *   Similar to statement 1, this is about borogoves chortling at raths. The given information is about raths chortling at borogoves.\n    *   The given information doesn't guarantee that *any* borogove chortled at *every* rath. It's perfectly consistent with the rule that raths chortle at borogoves, but borogoves don't chortle at raths at all, or only at some, or none at all.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n3.  **A borogove chortled at a rath.**\n    *   Again, this is about borogoves chortling at raths.\n    *   The given rule is \"Every rath chortled at a borogove.\" This means for any rath R, there's some borogove B such that C(R, B). This does *not* imply that for any borogove B, there's some rath R such that C(B, R).\n    *   Consider a scenario: Rath1 chortled at Borogove1. Rath2 chortled at Borogove2. No borogove chortled at any rath. This scenario is consistent with \"Every rath chortled at a borogove\" but makes statement 3 false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n4.  **Every borogove chortled at every rath.**\n    *   This is a very strong statement about borogoves chortling at raths.\n    *   The given information (\"Every rath chortled at a borogove\") does not support this. It's entirely possible that no borogove chortled at any rath, or only some did, or only at some raths.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n5.  **A rath chortled at a borogove.**\n    *   The given rule is \"Every rath chortled at a borogove.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one rath (given in the problem statement: \"there's at least one of each\"), and every rath chortled at a borogove, it logically follows that *at least one* rath must have chortled at *at least one* borogove.\n    *   If there's a rath (and we know there is), then that rath chortled at *a* borogove. This directly implies \"A rath chortled at a borogove.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement *must* be true.\n\n6.  **Every borogove chortled at a rath.**\n    *   This statement is about every borogove chortling at *some* rath.\n    *   The given information is \"Every rath chortled at a borogove.\" This is the inverse relationship.\n    *   Consider a scenario: There are Borogove1, Borogove2, and Rath1. Rath1 chortled at Borogove1. (This satisfies \"Every rath chortled at a borogove\" because Rath1 is the only rath, and it chortled at a borogove). In this scenario, Borogove2 did not chortle at any rath. So, \"Every borogove chortled at a rath\" would be false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement does not *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 5 must be true based on the given information. The information about Rafin and Zindle is irrelevant to the chortling statements.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",

This means T, B, and R are mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories.\n*   **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n*   **Rath Action:** Every rath (R) snicker-snacked Zindle (S(R, Z)).\n*   **Borogove Actions:** Every borogove (B) snicker-snacked Zindle (S(B, Z)) AND a rath galumphed over Zindle (G(R, Z)).\n*   **Mimsy/Bungo Condition:** No borogoves are mimsy (\u00acM(B)) only if Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin (\u00acS(Bungo, Rafin)). This is a conditional statement: If \u00acM(B), then \u00acS(Bungo, Rafin).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's look at the core information related to Zindle and raths.\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n\"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\nThis statement directly tells us about the action of raths towards Zindle.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n1.  **Zindle snicker-snacked every rath.**\n    This statement reverses the subject and object of the action. The given information states \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle,\" not the other way around. We have no information about Zindle performing actions on raths. So, this is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    Since \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle,\" and we know there is at least one rath, it logically follows that *at least one* rath (i.e., \"a rath\") snicker-snacked Zindle. This statement must be true.\n\n3.  **Not all raths snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    This contradicts the given information \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\" If every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, then it's false that not all of them did. So, this is not true.\n\n4.  **Zindle snicker-snacked a rath.**\n    Similar to statement 1, this reverses the subject and object. We only know raths snicker-snacked Zindle, not Zindle snicker-snacked raths. So, this is not necessarily true.\n\n5.  **No raths snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    This directly contradicts the given information \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\" If every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, then it's false that no raths did. So, this is not true.\n\n6.  **Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n    The first part \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\" is about Zindle acting on itself, for which we have no information. The second part \"a rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true (as established in statement 2). However, because the first part is unknown, the entire conjunction cannot be definitively true. We cannot confirm if Zindle snicker-snacked itself or not.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct statement \"Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle\" and the fact that there is at least one rath, the only statement that *must* be true is that \"A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

So, $\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, r_0)$.\n\nLet's consider premise (4): $(\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Zindle})) \\implies (\\forall t \\in T, \\text{burble}(t))$\nLet's consider premise (6): $\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Zindle})) \\implies (\\text{galumph}(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo}) \\iff \\neg (\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Bungo})))$\n\n**Let's try to determine if \"all toves galumphed over Zindle\" is true or false.**\n\nAssume $\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Zindle})$ is TRUE.\nFrom (4), this implies $\\forall t \\in T, \\text{burble}(t)$ is TRUE.\nIf $\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Zindle})$ is TRUE, then the antecedent of (6) is FALSE, so (6) tells us nothing.\n\nAssume $\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Zindle})$ is FALSE.\nThis means $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Zindle})$.\nFrom (6), this implies $(\\text{galumph}(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo}) \\iff \\neg (\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Bungo})))$.\n\nLet's consider Zindle's type.\nFrom (7), Zindle isn't beamish.\nFrom (1), Zindle is a tove, borogove, or rath.\n\n**Possibility 1: Zindle is a rath.**\nIf Zindle is a rath, then $\\neg \\text{beamish}(\\text{Zindle})$ means $\\neg (\\forall r \\in R, \\text{beamish}(r))$ is true.\nFrom (5): $\\neg (\\forall b \\in B, \\text{mimsy}(b)) \\implies (\\neg \\text{galumph}(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Bungo}) \\iff \\text{False})$\nThis implies $\\neg (\\forall b \\in B, \\text{mimsy}(b)) \\implies \\text{galumph}(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Bungo})$.\n\nAlso, from (3), there is a rath $r_0$ such that every tove galumphed over $r_0$.\nIf Zindle is a rath, then Zindle could be $r_0$.\nIf Zindle is $r_0$, then $\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Zindle})$ is true.\nIf $\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, \\text{Zindle})$ is true, then from (4), $\\forall t \\in T, \\text{burble}(t)$ is true.\n\nWhat if Zindle is not $r_0$? Still, $\\exists r_0 \\in R \\text{ s.t. } \\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, r_0)$.\n\n**Possibility 2: Zindle is a tove.**\nIf Zindle is a tove, then $\\neg \\text{beamish}(\\text{Zindle})$ means there is a tove that is not beamish. This doesn't directly affect (5) or (3).\nRafin is a tove (8). Zindle is a tove.\n\n**Possibility 3: Zindle is a borogove.**\nIf Zindle is a borogove, then $\\neg \\text{beamish}(\\text{Zindle})$ means there is a borogove that is not beamish. This doesn't directly affect (5) or (3).\n\nLet's re-examine (3): $\\exists r_0 \\in R \\text{ s.t. } \\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, r_0)$.\nThis means that for *every* tove, there is *some* rath (namely $r_0$) that it galumphed over.\nThis directly implies that for any tove $t$, $t$ galumphed over $r_0$.\nSo, $\\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, r_0)$.\nSince $r_0$ is a rath, this means that every tove galumphed over *a* rath (specifically, $r_0$).\n\nLet's check the statements:\n\n**1. A tove galumphed over a rath.**\nFrom premise (3), there exists a rath $r_0$ such that every tove galumphed over $r_0$.\nSince $|T| \\ge 1$ (premise 2), let $t_1$ be a tove.\nThen $t_1$ galumphed over $r_0$.\nSo, yes, a tove galumphed over a rath. This statement must be true.\n\n**2. There is a tove that every rath galumphed over.**\nThis means $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ s.t. } \\forall r \\in R, \\text{galumph}(t, r)$.\nWe know $\\exists r_0 \\in R \\text{ s.t. } \\forall t \\in T, \\text{galumph}(t, r_0)$. This is different.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. For example, if there are two raths, $r_1$ and $r_2$, and a tove $t_1$ galumphed over $r_1$ but not $r_2$, and another tove $t_2$ galumphed over $r_2$ but not $r",

This means T, B, and R are disjoint sets, and their union covers everything.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Tove Property:** A tove is uffish (U). (T $\\implies$ U)\n4.  **Borogove Property:** Every borogove is uffish. (B $\\implies$ U)\n5.  **Tove Chortling (Bungo):** No toves chortled at Bungo. (This is a crucial one!) Let C(X, Y) mean \"X chortled at Y\". So, for any tove 't', it's NOT true that C(t, Bungo). This means $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\n6.  **Conditional Statement:** If not all borogoves are mimsy (M), then Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin only if not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n    *   Let P = \"Not all borogoves are mimsy\" ($\\neg \\forall b \\in B, M(b)$ or $\\exists b \\in B, \\neg M(b)$)\n    *   Let Q = \"Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin\" ($\\neg C(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Rafin})$)\n    *   Let R = \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" ($\\neg \\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Bungo})$)\n    *   The conditional statement is: P $\\implies$ (Q only if R).\n    *   \"Q only if R\" means Q $\\implies$ R.\n    *   So, the full conditional is: P $\\implies$ (Q $\\implies$ R).\n\n**Analyzing the Crucial Statement (5): \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\"**\n\nThis statement directly tells us that for any tove 't', 't' did not chortle at Bungo.\nThis can be rephrased as: \"It is not the case that any tove chortled at Bungo.\"\nOr, \"There is no tove 't' such that 't' chortled at Bungo.\"\nOr, \"All toves did not chortle at Bungo.\"\n\nLet's consider the negation of \"All toves chortled at Bungo\".\n\"All toves chortled at Bungo\" means $\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\nThe negation of this is $\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Bungo}))$, which is equivalent to $\\exists t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\n\nHowever, the given statement is \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\" This means $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the phrasing carefully.\n\"No toves chortled at Bungo\" means that the set of toves that chortled at Bungo is empty.\nThis is equivalent to saying: \"It is not true that *a* tove chortled at Bungo.\"\nIt is also equivalent to saying: \"It is not true that *some* tove chortled at Bungo.\"\nIt is also equivalent to saying: \"Every tove did *not* chortle at Bungo.\"\n\nSo, the statement \"No toves chortled at Bungo\" means:\n$\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this understanding.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n1.  **Bungo chortled at every tove.** (C(Bungo, t) for all t $\\in$ T)\n    *   The given information is about *toves chortling at Bungo*, not *Bungo chortling at toves*. There is no information to support or refute this.\n    *   **Must be true? No.**\n\n2.  **A tove chortled at Bungo.** ($\\exists t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Bungo})$)\n    *   The given information states \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\" This is the direct negation of \"A tove chortled at Bungo.\"\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n3.  **Bungo chortled at a tove.** ($\\exists t \\in T, C(\\text{Bungo}, t)$)\n    *   Similar to statement 1, this is about Bungo chortling at toves, not the other way around.

No.**\n\n4.  **Not all toves chortled at Bungo.** ($\\neg (\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Bungo}))$)\n    *   The given information is \"No toves chortled at Bungo,\" which means $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\n    *   If *every* tove did *not* chortle at Bungo, then it is certainly true that *not all* toves chortled at Bungo. (In fact, *zero* toves chortled at Bungo).\n    *   Let's be precise:\n        *   \"No toves chortled at Bungo\" means $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\n        *   \"All toves chortled at Bungo\" means $\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\n        *   \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" is the negation of \"All toves chortled at Bungo\".\n    *   Since we know $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$, it is impossible for $\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Bungo})$ to be true.\n    *   Therefore, its negation, \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo,\" **must be true**.\n\n5.  **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   We've established that \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" must be true.\n    *   However, there is no information about \"Bungo chortled at Bungo.\" This part could be true or false.\n    *   For an \"AND\" statement to be true, both parts must be true. Since we don't know about the second part, this statement **cannot be guaranteed to be true**.\n\n6.  **Every tove chortled at Bungo.** ($\\forall t \\in T, C(t, \\text{Bungo})$)\n    *   The given information states \"No toves chortled at Bungo,\" which means $\\forall t \\in T, \\neg C(t, \\text{Bungo})$.\n    *   This statement is the direct opposite of what is given.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be false**.\n\n**Revisiting the Conditional Statement (P $\\implies$ (Q $\\implies$ R))**\n\n*   P = \"Not all borogoves are mimsy\"\n*   Q = \"Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin\"\n*   R = \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\"\n\nWe have determined that R (\"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\") **must be true** based on the statement \"No toves chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nIf R is true, then (Q $\\implies$ R) is true, regardless of Q's truth value (because a true consequent makes an implication true).\nAnd if (Q $\\implies$ R) is true, then P $\\implies$ (Q $\\implies$ R) is true, regardless of P's truth value.\n\nThis means the conditional statement itself is consistent with our findings, but it doesn't add new information that helps determine the truth of the options, as the truth of R is already established by a direct statement.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct statement \"No toves chortled at Bungo,\" we can definitively conclude the truth value of several options.\n\nThe statement \"No toves chortled at Bungo\" means that for every tove 't', it is not the case that 't' chortled at Bungo.\nThis implies that the set of toves that chortled at Bungo is empty.\n\n*   If the set of toves that chortled at Bungo is empty, then it is certainly true that \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" (because zero toves chortled at Bungo, which is definitely not \"all\").\n\nTherefore, statement 4 is the only one that must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

These are exclusive and there's at least one of each.\n*   **Tove Property:** Every T chortled at Bungo (C(T, Bungo)).\n*   **Bungo Property:** Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo (\u00acC(Bungo, Bungo)).\n*   **Gyring Property:** Only B gyred (G(x) -> x is B). This implies if something gyred, it's a borogove. Conversely, if something is not a borogove, it didn't gyre.\n*   **Tove/Rafin/Beamish:** (\u00ac\u2200T C(T, Rafin)) <-> (\u00ac\u2200T Beamish(T)). This is a biconditional.\n*   **Rath/Bungo/Borogove/Rafin/Beamish:** (\u2200R Snicker(R, Bungo)) -> (Snicker(B, Bungo) -> Beamish(Rafin)).\n*   **Zindle/Rafin:** \u00acBeamish(Zindle) and \u00acG(Rafin).\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n1.  **Bungo's Category:**\n    *   We know C(T, Bungo) for all T.\n    *   We know \u00acC(Bungo, Bungo).\n    *   If Bungo were a Tove, then C(Bungo, Bungo) would be true (because every Tove chortled at Bungo).\n    *   Since \u00acC(Bungo, Bungo) is true, Bungo cannot be a Tove.\n    *   Therefore, **Bungo isn't a tove.** (Statement 3 is true).\n\n2.  **Zindle's Gyring Status:**\n    *   We are given \u00acBeamish(Zindle). This doesn't directly tell us about Zindle's category or gyring status yet.\n    *   We know that only borogoves gyred. This means if something is not a borogove, it didn't gyre.\n    *   We don't know Zindle's category. If Zindle is a Tove or a Rath, then Zindle didn't gyre. If Zindle is a Borogove, Zindle *could* gyre.\n    *   Let's re-examine the \"only borogoves gyred\" rule: G(x) -> x is B.\n    *   This means if x is not B, then \u00acG(x).\n    *   We don't know if Zindle is a Borogove. So we cannot definitively say Zindle gyred or didn't gyre *yet*.\n\n3.  **Rafin's Category and Gyring Status:**\n    *   We are given \u00acG(Rafin).\n    *   Since only borogoves gyred, and Rafin didn't gyre, Rafin cannot be a borogove.\n    *   Therefore, Rafin is either a Tove or a Rath.\n\n4.  **Revisiting Zindle's Gyring Status (with more information):**\n    *   We know \u00acBeamish(Zindle).\n    *   We have the biconditional: (\u00ac\u2200T C(T, Rafin)) <-> (\u00ac\u2200T Beamish(T)).\n    *   This means: (\u2200T C(T, Rafin)) <-> (\u2200T Beamish(T)).\n    *   We don't have enough information to determine if all Toves chortled at Rafin or if all Toves are beamish.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the statements:\n\n*   **1. Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n    *   We know Bungo isn't a tove. We don't know if Bungo is a borogove. If Bungo is a rath, Bungo didn't gyre. So we can't confirm Bungo gyred.\n    *   We don't know if Zindle gyred.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **2. Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n    *   We know \u00acG(Rafin). So Rafin didn't gyre.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n*   **3. Bungo isn't a tove.**\n    *   As deduced in step 1, this is true. If Bungo were a tove, Bungo would have chortled at Bungo, which contradicts the given information.\n\n*   **4. Bungo is a tove.**\n    *   This is the opposite of statement 3, which we found to be true. So this statement is false.\n\n*   **5. Zindle didn't gyre.**\n    *   We know that only borogoves gyred. This means if something is *not* a borogove, it didn't gyre.\n    *   We are given \u00acBeamish(Zindle). This doesn't tell us Zindle's category.\n    *   Could Zindle be a borogove? Yes. If Zindle is a borogove, Zindle *could* gyre.\n    *   Could Zindle be a tove or a rath? Yes. If Zindle is a tove or a rath, Zindle *didn't* gyre.\n    *   Since we don't know Zindle's category, we cannot definitively say Zindle didn't gyre. It's possible Zindle is a borogove and gyred.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n*   **6. Zindle gyred.**\n    *   Similar to statement 5, we don't know Zindle's category. If Zindle is a tove or a rath, Zindle didn't gyre.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nLet's double check if any other deductions are possible.\n\n*   The statement \"Not all toves chortled at Rafin only if not all toves are beamish\" is equivalent to:\n    (\u00ac\u2200T C(T, Rafin)) <-> (\u00ac\u2200T Beamish(T))\n    This is also equivalent to:\n    (\u2200T C(T, Rafin)) <-> (\u2200T Beamish(T))\n    We don't have information to confirm or deny either side of this biconditional.\n\n*   The statement \"If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin is beamish.\"\n    (\u2200R Snicker(R, Bungo)) -> ( (\u2203B Snicker(B, Bungo)) -> Beamish(Rafin) )\n    We don't have information about snicker-snacking or whether Rafin is beamish.\n\nThe only definitive conclusion we could draw is about Bungo's category.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n*   Every tove chortled at Bungo.\n*   If Bungo were a tove, then Bungo would chortle at Bungo (by the second rule).\n*   This contradicts the first rule.\n*   Therefore, Bungo cannot be a tove.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

There's at least one of each.\n2.  **Raths & Rafin:** No raths snicker-snacked Rafin.\n3.  **Borogoves & Uffish:** A borogove is uffish (U). (This implies *at least one* borogove is uffish, but given the phrasing \"A borogove is uffish\", it often implies a general characteristic, meaning *all* borogoves are uffish. Let's keep this in mind.)\n4.  **Rafin & Zindle:** Rafin didn't galumph (G) over Zindle. (\u00acG(Rafin, Zindle))\n5.  **Toves & Bungo:** No toves galumphed over Bungo. (\u00ac\u2203t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo))\n6.  **Zindle & Uffish:** Zindle is uffish (U(Zindle)).\n7.  **Conditional Statement:** If every rath is mimsy (M), then Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo (\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo)).\n    *   Let P = \"Every rath is mimsy.\" (\u2200r \u2208 R, M(r))\n    *   Let Q = \"Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo.\" (\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo))\n    *   Let S = \"Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo))\n    *   The statement is: P \u2192 (Q only if S) which is P \u2192 (S \u2192 Q). (Note: \"Q only if S\" means \"If Q then S\", or S \u2192 Q. This is a common point of confusion. \"A only if B\" means A implies B, or A -> B. So, \"Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" means (\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) -> (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo)). Let's re-evaluate this.\n    *   \"A only if B\" is equivalent to \"If A then B\". So, \"Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" means: If (Zindle didn't galumph over Bungo) then (not all toves galumphed over Bungo).\n    *   So, the conditional statement is: P \u2192 ((\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo))).\n\nLet's re-examine statement 5: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This means \u00ac\u2203t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo). This is equivalent to saying \"All toves did not galumph over Bungo,\" or \"It is not the case that any tove galumphed over Bungo.\"\nThis also means that \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo)) is TRUE. In fact, it's stronger: *no* toves galumphed over Bungo.\nSo, S is true: \u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo) is true because \u00ac\u2203t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo) is true.\n\nNow let's look at the conditional statement: P \u2192 ((\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) \u2192 S).\nSince S is true, the implication (\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) \u2192 S is always true, regardless of whether \u00acG(Zindle, Bungo) is true or false. (Because True is the consequent).\nTherefore, the entire conditional statement P \u2192 ((\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) \u2192 S) is always true, regardless of P.\nThis means the conditional statement gives us no new information about P (whether every rath is mimsy) or Q (whether Zindle galumphed over Bungo).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the interpretation of \"A only if B\".\n\"A only if B\" means A cannot be true unless B is true. This is equivalent to A implies B (A \u2192 B).\nSo, the conditional statement is: P \u2192 ((\u00acG(Zindle, Bungo)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo))).\nLet's use the simplified forms: P \u2192 (Q \u2192 S).\nWe know from statement 5: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This means \u00ac\u2203t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo).\nThis implies that it is *not* the case that all toves galumphed over Bungo (\u00ac\u2200t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo)). So, S is TRUE.\nSince S is TRUE, the implication (Q \u2192 S) is TRUE (because a true consequent makes the implication true).\nSince (Q \u2192 S) is TRUE, the entire statement P \u2192 (Q \u2192 S) is TRUE, regardless of P.\nThis means the conditional statement provides no new information that *must* be true.\n\nLet's re-read \"A borogove is uffish\". This usually implies a general characteristic, meaning *all* borogoves are uffish. If it meant \"at least one borogove is uffish\", it would typically be phrased as \"There is a borogove that is uffish\". Given the context of these types of problems, \"A borogove is uffish\" implies \"Every borogove is uffish.\"\n\n**Let's summarize what we know for sure:**\n\n*   **From 3:** Every borogove is uffish (\u2200b \u2208 B, U(b)).\n*   **From 5:** No toves galumphed over Bungo (\u00ac\u2203t \u2208 T, G(t, Bungo)). This is a very strong statement.\n*   **From 6:** Zindle is uffish (U(Zindle)).\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n1.  **Zindle and Bungo are mimsy.**\n    *   We know nothing about Zindle or Bungo being mimsy. The conditional statement didn't force P to be true, nor did it force Q to be true or false. So, we cannot conclude anything about mimsiness.\n\n2.  **No toves galumphed over Bungo and every borogove is uffish.**\n    *   \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" is directly stated in point 5. (TRUE)\n    *   \"Every borogove is uffish\" is derived from point 3 (\"A borogove is uffish\"). (TRUE)\n    *   Since both parts are true, this statement must be true.\n\n3.  **A borogove is uffish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n    *   \"A borogove is uffish\" is directly stated in point 3. (TRUE)\n    *   \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" is directly stated in point 5. (TRUE)\n    *   Since both parts are true, this statement must be true.\n\n4.  **Zindle isn't mimsy.**\n    *   We know nothing about Zindle being mimsy or not mimsy.\n\n5.  **Zindle and Rafin are mimsy.**\n    *   We know nothing about Zindle or Rafin being mimsy.\n\n6.  **Zindle is mimsy.**\n    *   We know nothing about Zindle being mimsy.\n\n**Comparing Option 2 and Option 3:**\n\nOption 2 states \"No toves galumphed over Bungo and **every** borogove is uffish.\"\nOption 3 states \"A borogove is uffish and no toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\n\nIf \"A borogove is uffish\" means \"Every borogove is uffish\", then Option 2 and Option 3 are logically equivalent.\nHowever, if \"A borogove is uffish\" means \"At least one borogove is uffish\", then Option 3 would be true, but Option 2 might not be.\n\nLet's consider the common interpretation in these types of logic puzzles. When a characteristic is stated for a general noun (\"A borogove is uffish\"), it typically implies that this is a defining characteristic of the group, meaning *all* members of that group possess it. If it meant \"at least one\", it would usually be phrased as \"There is a borogove that is uffish\" or \"Some borogoves are uffish\".\n\nGiven this common interpretation:\n*   \"A borogove is uffish\" (from 3) implies \"Every borogove is uffish\".\n*   \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" (from 5) is explicitly stated.\n\nTherefore, both Option 2 and Option 3 must be true. The question asks \"Which, if any, of the following statements must be true\". If both are true, we should pick the one that is most directly supported or the most comprehensive.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the phrasing \"A borogove is uffish\".\nIf I say \"A dog is a mammal\", it means all dogs are mammals.\nIf I say \"A dog has four legs\", it means most dogs have four legs, but not necessarily all (e.g., an injured dog).\nHowever, in formal logic puzzles, \"A X is Y\" often implies \"All X are Y\" unless context strongly suggests otherwise.\n\nLet's assume the stronger interpretation: \"A borogove is uffish\" means \"Every borogove is uffish\".\nIn this case:\n*   Statement 3: \"A borogove is uffish\" (True, by assumption) AND \"no toves galumphed over Bungo\" (True, by statement 5). So, Statement 3 is True.\n*   Statement 2: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" (True, by statement 5) AND \"every borogove is uffish\" (True, by assumption). So, Statement 2 is True.\n\nBoth 2 and 3 must be true under this interpretation. This is unusual for a multiple-choice question where only one answer is expected. Let's check if there's any subtle difference.\n\nOption 3 uses the exact phrasing \"A borogove is uffish\" from the problem statement.\nOption 2 uses the inferred \"every borogove is uffish\".\n\nIf we take \"A borogove is uffish\" to mean *only* \"at least one borogove is uffish\", then:\n*   Statement 3: \"A borogove is uffish\" (True, directly from 3) AND \"no toves galumphed over Bungo\" (True, from 5). So, Statement 3 is True.\n*   Statement 2: \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" (True, from 5) AND",

Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n   For all t in T, for all r in R, S(t, r).\n\n2. A rath snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked a tove.\n   There exists r_0 in R, there exists b_0 in B, there exists t_0 in T such that S(r_0, b_0) and S(b_0, t_0).\n\n3. If a rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Zindle is mimsy.\n   This statement is a conditional about Bungo and Zindle, and it doesn't seem to directly relate to the snicker-snacking relationships between toves, borogoves, and raths. It's likely a distractor for the main question.\n\nLet's analyze the given options based on the first two statements.\n\nOption 1: There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked.\n   This means: There exists t_x in T such that for all r in R, S(r, t_x).\n   From statement 1, we know that for all t in T, for all r in R, S(t, r). This tells us about toves snicker-snacking raths, not raths snicker-snacking toves.\n   We don't have information about raths snicker-snacking toves. So, we cannot confirm this.\n\nOption 2: Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n   This means: For all t in T, there exists r in R such that S(t, r).\n   From statement 1, we know that for all t in T, for all r in R, S(t, r).\n   If a tove snicker-snacked *every* rath, then it certainly snicker-snacked *a* rath (since there's at least one rath).\n   So, this statement must be true.\n\nOption 3: No toves snicker-snacked every rath.\n   This means: For all t in T, there exists r in R such that not S(t, r).\n   This contradicts statement 1, which says that every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n   So, this statement must be false.\n\nOption 4: There is not a tove that every rath snicker-snacked.\n   This means: For all t in T, there exists r in R such that not S(r, t).\n   This is the negation of Option 1. We don't have information about raths snicker-snacking toves, so we cannot confirm this.\n\nOption 5: Every rath snicker-snacked every tove.\n   This means: For all r in R, for all t in T, S(r, t).\n   We don't have information about raths snicker-snacking toves. So, we cannot confirm this.\n\nOption 6: No toves snicker-snacked a rath.\n   This means: For all t in T, for all r in R, not S(t, r).\n   This contradicts statement 1, which says that every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n   So, this statement must be false.\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on the certainty.\n\nFrom \"Every tove snicker-snacked every rath\":\nThis means: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(t, r)$.\n\nLet's check the options again:\n\n1. There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked. ($\\exists t_x \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(r, t_x)$)\n   We don't know anything about raths snicker-snacking toves. So, we cannot conclude this.\n\n2. Every tove snicker-snacked a rath. ($\\forall t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, S(t, r)$)\n   Since \"Every tove snicker-snacked *every* rath\", it implies that for any given tove, it snicker-snacked all raths. Since there is at least one rath, it must have snicker-snacked at least one rath. This statement is a direct logical consequence of the first given statement. This must be true.\n\n3. No toves snicker-snacked every rath. ($\\forall t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, \\neg S(t, r)$)\n   This directly contradicts \"Every tove snicker-snacked every rath\". So, this must be false.\n\n4. There is not a tove that every rath snicker-snacked. ($\\neg (\\exists t_x \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, S(r, t_x))$ which is $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R, \\neg S(r, t)$)\n   This is the negation of option 1. We don't know anything about raths snicker-snacking toves. So, we cannot conclude this.\n\n5. Every rath snicker-snacked every tove. ($\\forall r \\in R, \\forall t \\in T, S(r, t)$)\n   We don't know anything about raths snicker-snacking toves. So, we cannot conclude this.\n\n6. No toves snicker-snacked a rath. ($\\forall t \\in T, \\forall r \\in R, \\neg S(t, r)$)\n   This directly contradicts \"Every tove snicker-snacked every rath\". So, this must be false.\n\nThe second given statement (\"A rath snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked a tove\") and the third given statement (\"If a rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Zindle is mimsy\") do not provide information that changes the truth value of the options related to toves and raths snicker-snacking each other in the general sense. The first statement alone is sufficient to determine the truth of option 2.\n\nFinal check:\nGiven: Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\nThis means: For any tove 't' and any rath 'r', t snicker-snacked r.\nSince there is at least one rath, for any tove 't', it snicker-snacked all raths, and thus it snicker-snacked at least one rath.\nTherefore, \"Every tove snicker-snacked a rath\" must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

If *no* raths snicker-snacked Bungo, then it's impossible for *every* rath to have snicker-snacked Bungo.\n*   Therefore, Statement 6 **must be false**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 1 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

According to this rule, there must exist *some* rath, let's call it $r_b$, such that $G(b, r_b)$ and $G(r_b, b)$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n1.  **No borogoves galumphed over every rath.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall b \\in B, \\neg (\\forall r \\in R, G(b, r))$.\n    *   Or, equivalently: $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists r \\in R, \\neg G(b, r)$.\n    *   Does the given information imply this? Not necessarily. The information states that for each borogove, there's *at least one* rath it galumphed over (and vice-versa). It doesn't preclude a borogove from galumphing over *all* raths.\n\n2.  **Every borogove galumphed over every rath.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall b \\in B, \\forall r \\in R, G(b, r)$.\n    *   Does the given information imply this? No. The information only guarantees that for each borogove $b$, there's *some* rath $r_b$ such that $G(b, r_b)$ and $G(r_b, b)$. It doesn't say that $b$ galumphed over *all* raths.\n\n3.  **A borogove galumphed over a rath.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists b \\in B, \\exists r \\in R, G(b, r)$.\n    *   From point 3: \"Every borogove galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it.\"\n    *   Since there is at least one borogove (point 2: $|B| \\ge 1$), let's pick one, say $b_0$.\n    *   According to point 3, $b_0$ must have galumphed over *some* rath, say $r_0$. So, $G(b_0, r_0)$ is true.\n    *   Therefore, \"A borogove galumphed over a rath\" must be true.\n\n4.  **There is a borogove that every rath galumphed over.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists b \\in B, \\forall r \\in R, G(r, b)$.\n    *   Does the given information imply this? No. The information states that for every borogove $b$, there's *a* rath $r_b$ such that $G(r_b, b)$. It doesn't say there's one specific borogove that *all* raths galumphed over.\n\n5.  **A borogove galumphed over every rath.**\n    *   This means: $\\exists b \\in B, \\forall r \\in R, G(b, r)$.\n    *   Does the given information imply this? No. Similar to statement 2, the information only guarantees a specific rath for each borogove, not that one borogove galumphed over all raths.\n\n6.  **No borogoves galumphed over a rath.**\n    *   This means: $\\forall b \\in B, \\neg (\\exists r \\in R, G(b, r))$.\n    *   Or, equivalently: $\\forall b \\in B, \\forall r \\in R, \\neg G(b, r)$.\n    *   This is the direct opposite of what point 3 implies. Point 3 explicitly states that *every* borogove *did* galumph over *a* rath. So this statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion based on direct implications:**\n\nStatement 3 is directly implied by the combination of \"Every borogove galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it\" and \"there's at least one borogove\".\n\nThe complex conditional statement about Rafin, mimsy, and Bungo (point 4) and the statement about whiffle and Bungo (point 5) are not needed to determine the truth of statement 3. They might be relevant if we needed to deduce something about mimsy, snicker-snacking, or toves galumphing over Bungo, but they don't affect the direct relationship between borogoves and raths described in point 3.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Point 3: \"Every borogove galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it.\"\n*   Point 2: \"there's at least one of each [tove, borogove, rath].\"\n*   Let $b_0$ be a borogove (we know one exists).\n*   By point 3, $b_0$ galumphed over *a* rath (let's call it $r_0$).\n*   Therefore, there exists a borogove ($b_0$) and there exists a rath ($r_0$) such that the borogove galumphed over the rath. This is exactly what statement 3 says.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

There's at least one of each.\n2.  **Zindle's Action:** Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle (S(Z,Z) is false).\n3.  **Rath/Tove Chortle:** A rath chortled at Zindle (C(R,Z)) only if a tove chortled at Rafin (C(T,Rafin)). (C(R,Z) -> C(T,Rafin))\n4.  **Bungo's Uffishness:** Bungo is uffish (U(Bungo)) just in case a borogove chortled at Bungo (C(B,Bungo)). (U(Bungo) <-> C(B,Bungo))\n5.  **Borogove Whiffle:** Not all borogoves will whiffle (W(B) is not universally true).\n6.  **Rafin's Category:** It is not the case that Rafin is a tove (Rafin is not T).\n7.  **Bungo's Action:** Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo (S(B,B) is false).\n8.  **Tove Whiffle:** Every tove will whiffle (W(T) is universally true).\n\n**Let's simplify and deduce from the given information:**\n\n*   From (2): S(Z,Z) is False.\n*   From (6): Rafin is not a tove. Since everything is exclusively T, B, or R, Rafin must be a borogove or a rath.\n*   From (8): All toves whiffle.\n*   From (5): Not all borogoves whiffle. This implies there is at least one borogove that does not whiffle.\n\n**Now let's evaluate each statement:**\n\n**Statement 1: If no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n*   This is a conditional statement: (Not S(T,Z)) -> (Not S(Rafin,Rafin)).\n*   We know S(Z,Z) is false. This statement is about *toves* snicker-snacking Zindle, not Zindle snicker-snacking Zindle.\n*   We have no information about whether toves snicker-snacked Zindle, nor about Rafin snicker-snacking Rafin.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 2: No toves snicker-snacked Zindle only if Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n*   This is equivalent to Statement 1. \"A only if B\" means \"If A then B\".\n*   So, (Not S(T,Z)) -> (Not S(Rafin,Rafin)).\n*   Same reasoning as Statement 1, we cannot determine if this must be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove.**\n*   This is a conjunction: (Not S(Z,Z)) AND (Not (Rafin is not T)).\n*   From (2), we know \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\" (Not S(Z,Z)) is TRUE.\n*   Let's evaluate the second part: \"it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove\". This simplifies to \"Rafin is a tove\".\n*   From (6), we know \"it is not the case that Rafin is a tove\", which means \"Rafin is not a tove\".\n*   So, \"Rafin is a tove\" is FALSE.\n*   Therefore, the statement is (TRUE AND FALSE), which is FALSE.\n*   This statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 4: Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n*   This is a conjunction: (Not S(Z,Z)) AND (Rafin is not T).\n*   From (2), we know \"Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle\" (Not S(Z,Z)) is TRUE.\n*   From (6), we know \"Rafin is not a tove\" (Rafin is not T) is TRUE.\n*   Therefore, the statement is (TRUE AND TRUE), which is TRUE.\n*   This statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.**\n*   This is a conjunction: (Not all S(T,Z)) AND (Not (Rafin is T)).\n*   Let's evaluate the second part: \"it is not the case that Rafin is a tove\". This is directly from (6) and is TRUE.\n*   We have no information about whether all toves snicker-snacked Zindle. It's possible all did, or some did, or none did.\n*   Since we don't know if \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is true, we cannot determine if the entire conjunction must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle and Rafin is a tove.**\n*   This is a conjunction: (Not all S(T,Z)) AND (Rafin is T).\n*   Let's evaluate the second part: \"Rafin is a tove\".\n*   From (6), we know \"it is not the case that Rafin is a tove\", which means \"Rafin is not a tove\".\n*   So, \"Rafin is a tove\" is FALSE.\n*   Therefore, the statement is (X AND FALSE), which is FALSE, regardless of the first part.\n*   This statement must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

This statement is about Zindle, not Rafin.\n*   Let's re-evaluate `Z_C_B <=> AllT_G`. We don't have direct information about `Z_C_B` yet.\n\nFrom statement 2 (`B_C_R AND AllR_G`):\n*   `B_C_R` is true. (A borogove chortled at Rafin)\n*   `AllR_G` is true. (Every rath gyred)\n\nLet's re-examine the first statement: \"Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo if and only if not all toves gyred.\"\nThis is `not(Z_C_B) <=> not(AllT_G)`.\nThis is logically equivalent to `Z_C_B <=> AllT_G`.\n\nWe have `Z_G` (Zindle gyred) from statement 3. This tells us something about Zindle, but not necessarily about *all* toves gyring, nor about Zindle chortling at Bungo.\n\nLet's look at the options provided and see what we can confirm.\n\n**Evaluate the options:**\n\n1.  **Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n    *   We know `Z_G` (Zindle gyred) is true from statement 3.\n    *   We have no information about whether Bungo gyred. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.  **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n    *   We know `Z_G` (Zindle gyred) is true from statement 3.\n    *   Therefore, \"Zindle didn't gyre\" is false. This statement is not true.\n\n3.  **Rafin gyred.**\n    *   We have no information about whether Rafin gyred. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4.  **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred.**\n    *   From statement 2, `B_C_R` (A borogove chortled at Rafin) is true.\n    *   From statement 3, `Z_G` (Zindle gyred) is true.\n    *   Since both parts are true, the conjunction \"A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred\" must be true.\n\n5.  **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Zindle gyred.**\n    *   \"A borogove chortled at Rafin\" is true (from statement 2).\n    *   \"it is not the case that Zindle gyred\" means `not(Z_G)`.\n    *   We know `Z_G` is true (from statement 3), so `not(Z_G)` is false.\n    *   Since the second part of the \"but\" (which implies \"and\") is false, the entire statement is false.\n\n6.  **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n    *   We know `Z_G` (Zindle gyred) is true from statement 3.\n    *   We have no information about whether Rafin gyred. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on our deductions, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Definitions and Setup:**\n\n*   **Categories:** Tove (T), Borogove (B), Rath (R). These are exclusive categories, and there's at least one of each.\n*   **Actions:**\n    *   `chortled_at(X, Y)`: X chortled at Y.\n    *   `snicker_snacked(X, Y)`: X snicker-snacked Y.\n\n**Given Statements (Premises):**\n\n1.  **`is_tove(X) OR is_borogove(X) OR is_rath(X)` (exclusive and exhaustive)**: Every entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n2.  **`exists(T) AND exists(B) AND exists(R)`**: There's at least one of each type.\n3.  **`FORALL b IN B, FORALL r IN R, chortled_at(r, b)`**: A rath chortled at every borogove.\n4.  **`FORALL t IN T, snicker_snacked(Bungo, t)`**: Bungo snicker-snacked every tove.\n5.  **`NOT is_borogove(Bungo) IFF is_borogove(Bungo)`**: Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.\n    *   Let `P` be `is_borogove(Bungo)`. The statement is `NOT P IFF P`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `(NOT P IMPLIES P) AND (P IMPLIES NOT P)`.\n    *   `NOT P IMPLIES P` means `P OR P`, which simplifies to `P`.\n    *   `P IMPLIES NOT P` means `NOT P OR NOT P`, which simplifies to `NOT P`.\n    *   So, `(NOT P IFF P)` simplifies to `P AND NOT P`. This is a contradiction.\n    *   **This means the premise set is inconsistent.**\n\nLet's re-read statement 5 carefully: \"Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.\"\nThis is an \"only if\" statement, which means `A only if B` is `A IMPLIES B`.\nSo, `(NOT is_borogove(Bungo)) IMPLIES is_borogove(Bungo)`.\nThis is equivalent to `is_borogove(Bungo) OR is_borogove(Bungo)`, which simplifies to `is_borogove(Bungo)`.\nTherefore, statement 5 implies that **Bungo IS a borogove.**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"only if\" interpretation. In logic, \"A only if B\" is indeed `A -> B`.\nSo, `(Bungo isn't a borogove) -> (Bungo is a borogove)`.\nLet `X = Bungo is a borogove`. The statement is `(NOT X) -> X`.\nThis is equivalent to `X OR X`, which simplifies to `X`.\nSo, `is_borogove(Bungo)` must be true.\n\n6.  **`chortled_at(Zindle, Bungo) IFF NOT (EXISTS b IN B SUCH THAT chortled_at(b, Bungo))`**: Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case a borogove chortled at Bungo.\n    *   Let `C_ZB = chortled_at(Zindle, Bungo)`.\n    *   Let `C_BB = EXISTS b IN B SUCH THAT chortled_at(b, Bungo)`.\n    *   The statement is `NOT C_ZB IFF C_BB`.\n\n7.  **`is_beamish(Rath) AND NOT (NOT snicker_snacked(Bungo, Bungo))`**: A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\n    *   The second part: `NOT (NOT snicker_snacked(Bungo, Bungo))` simplifies to `snicker_snacked(Bungo, Bungo)`.\n    *   So, `snicker_snacked(Bungo, Bungo)` must be true.\n    *   The first part `is_beamish(Rath)` means that *some* rath is beamish. This doesn't directly tell us about Bungo or the chortling.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\nFrom (5): **Bungo is a borogove.** (`is_borogove(Bungo)`)\n\nNow, let's use this deduction:\n\n*   Since Bungo is a borogove, and there's at least one rath (Premise 2), and \"A rath chortled at every borogove\" (Premise 3):\n    *   `FORALL b IN B, FORALL r IN R, chortled_at(r, b)`\n    *   Since Bungo is a borogove, we can substitute Bungo for `b`:\n    *   `FORALL r IN R, chortled_at(r, Bungo)`\n    *   This means **Every rath chortled at Bungo.**\n\nLet's check the options based on this strong deduction:\n\n*   **1. A rath chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   This is true because \"Every rath chortled at Bungo\" implies that at least one rath chortled at Bungo (since there's at least one rath).\n*   **2. No raths chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   This is false, as \"Every rath chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n*   **3. Bungo chortled at every rath.**\n    *   We have no information about Bungo chortling at raths.\n*   **4. Bungo chortled at a rath.**\n    *   We have no information about Bungo chortling at raths.\n*   **5. Not all raths chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   This is false, as \"Every rath chortled at Bungo\" is true.\n*   **6. Every rath chortled at Bungo.**\n    *   This is true, as derived above.\n\n**Consistency Check:**\n\nLet's ensure the other premises don't contradict our findings.\n\n*   **Bungo is a borogove.**\n*   From (7): `snicker_snacked(Bungo, Bungo)`.\n    *   If Bungo is a borogove, then Bungo is not a tove (categories are exclusive).\n    *   Premise (4) states: `FORALL t IN T, snicker_snacked(Bungo, t)`.\n    *   This premise doesn't contradict `snicker_snacked(Bungo, Bungo)` because Bungo is not a tove. So, Bungo is not one of the `t`s that Bungo snicker-snacked. This is consistent.\n\n*   Premise (6): `NOT chortled_at(Zindle, Bungo) IFF (EXISTS b IN B SUCH THAT chortled_at(b, Bungo))`.\n    *   We know Bungo is a borogove. So, `EXISTS b IN B SUCH THAT chortled_at(b, Bungo)` becomes `chortled_at(Bungo, Bungo)` (since Bungo itself is a borogove).\n    *   So, `NOT chortled_at(Zindle, Bungo) IFF chortled_at(Bungo, Bungo)`.\n    *   We have no information to determine `chortled_at(Zindle, Bungo)` or `chortled_at(Bungo, Bungo)`. This premise doesn't contradict our findings about raths and Bungo.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe crucial step is the interpretation of \"Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.\" This statement, when translated to logical implication, forces Bungo to be a borogove. Once Bungo is established as a borogove, the premise \"A rath chortled at every borogove\" directly implies that every rath chortled at Bungo.\n\nTherefore, statements 1 and 6 must be true. The question asks \"Which, if any, of the following statements must be true in this situation?\". Both 1 and 6 must be true. If it's a multiple choice question where only one answer can be selected, then 6 is a stronger statement that implies 1. However, if multiple options can be selected, both are correct. Assuming we need to pick all that apply.\n\nLet's double check the phrasing \"Which, if any, of the following statements must be true\". This implies we should list all that are necessarily true.\n\n1.  A rath chortled at Bungo. (True, because every rath chortled at Bungo, and there's at least one rath).\n2.  No raths chortled at Bungo. (False)\n3.  Bungo chortled at every rath. (Cannot be determined)\n4.  Bungo chortled at a rath. (Cannot be determined)\n5.  Not all raths chortled at Bungo. (False)\n6.  Every rath chortled at Bungo. (True)\n\nBoth 1 and 6 are necessarily true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{1, 6}}$",

Every tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n    *   $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ s.t. } G(t, b)$.\n    *   From statement 2, we know that for every borogove $b_i$, there exists a tove $t_j$ such that $G(t_j, b_i)$.\n    *   This means that *some* toves galumphed over *some* borogoves. Specifically, for every borogove, there's a tove that galumphed over it.\n    *   However, this doesn't guarantee that *every* tove galumphed over *a* borogove.\n    *   Consider a scenario:\n        *   Borogoves: $B = \\{b_1\\}$\n        *   Toves: $T = \\{t_1, t_2\\}$\n        *   From statement 2: $G(b_1, t_1)$ and $G(t_1, b_1)$.\n        *   In this case, $t_1$ galumphed over $b_1$. But $t_2$ didn't necessarily galumph over any borogove.\n    *   Therefore, statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\n**2. A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n    *   $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ s.t. } \\forall b \\in B, G(t, b)$.\n    *   This means there's one specific tove that galumphed over all borogoves.\n    *   Statement 2 says: $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists t \\in T \\text{ s.t. } G(t, b)$. This means for each borogove, there's *some* tove that galumphed over it, but not necessarily the *same* tove for all borogoves.\n    *   Consider:\n        *   $B = \\{b_1, b_2\\}$\n        *   $T = \\{t_1, t_2\\}$\n        *   Statement 2 implies: $G(t_1, b_1)$ and $G(b_1, t_1)$. And $G(t_2, b_2)$ and $G(b_2, t_2)$.\n        *   In this case, no single tove galumphed over *every* borogove ($t_1$ didn't galumph over $b_2$, and $t_2$ didn't galumph over $b_1$).\n    *   Therefore, statement 2 is not necessarily true.\n\n**3. Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n    *   $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, G(t, b)$.\n    *   This is a much stronger claim than statement 2. Statement 2 only guarantees a specific mutual relationship for each borogove with *some* tove. It doesn't imply that *all* toves galumphed over *all* borogoves.\n    *   Using the counterexample from option 2, this is clearly false.\n    *   Therefore, statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n**4. No toves galumphed over a borogove.**\n    *   $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B \\text{ s.t. } G(t, b))$.\n    *   This means $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\neg G(t, b)$.\n    *   This directly contradicts statement 2, which says $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists t \\in T \\text{ s.t. } G(t, b)$. Since there's at least one borogove and at least one tove involved in this mutual galumphing, it means there *are* toves that galumphed over borogoves.\n    *   Therefore, statement 4 is false.\n\n**5.

No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n    *   $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, G(t, b))$.\n    *   This is the negation of statement 2.\n    *   Statement 2 was: \"A tove galumphed over every borogove.\"\n    *   We determined that statement 2 is not necessarily true. If statement 2 is not necessarily true, then its negation is not necessarily true either.\n    *   However, let's re-evaluate. If statement 2 (A tove galumphed over every borogove) is false, then statement 6 (No toves galumphed over every borogove) would be true.\n    *   We showed a counterexample for statement 2: $B = \\{b_1, b_2\\}$, $T = \\{t_1, t_2\\}$, $G(t_1, b_1)$, $G(t_2, b_2)$. In this case, no single tove galumphed over *every* borogove. So, statement 6 would be true in this scenario.\n    *   But what if there's only one borogove? $B = \\{b_1\\}$. Then statement 2 becomes: $\\exists t \\in T \\text{ s.t. } G(t, b_1)$.\n        *   From the given information (statement 2), we know $\\exists t_1 \\in T \\text{ s.t. } G(t_1, b_1) \\land G(b_1, t_1)$.\n        *   So, $t_1$ galumphed over $b_1$. Since $b_1$ is the *only* borogove, $t_1$ galumphed over *every* borogove.\n        *   In this case, statement 2 (\"A tove galumphed over every borogove\") *is* true.\n        *   If statement 2 is true, then statement 6 (\"No toves galumphed over every borogove\") is false.\n    *   Since statement 6 can be false (in the case of only one borogove), it does not *must* be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 5 must be true based on the given information, specifically from the second piece of information: \"Every borogove galumphed over a tove that galumphed over it.\"\n\nThe other pieces of information (about Rafin, Zindle, Bungo, and chortling) are",

(This seems like a distractor, as it doesn't involve toves, borogoves, or raths directly in relation to chortling or galumphing, nor Rafin).\n*   **Galumphing:** A tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it. (This implies a cycle: Tove A galumphed over Borogove B, and Borogove B galumphed over Tove A. This confirms the existence of at least one tove and at least one borogove).\n*   **Rafin & Toves:** Rafin chortled at *every* tove.\n\n**Analysis of Statements:**\n\n1.  **Rafin chortled at a tove.**\n    *   We are told \"Rafin chortled at *every* tove.\"\n    *   We are also told \"there's at least one of each\" (tove, borogove, rath).\n    *   Since there is at least one tove, and Rafin chortled at *every* tove, Rafin must have chortled at *a* tove.\n    *   **This statement must be true.**\n\n2.  **No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin isn't a tove.**\n    *   \"No toves chortled at Rafin\": We have no information about toves chortling at Rafin. This part is not necessarily true.\n    *   \"Rafin isn't a tove\": We know everything is *exclusively* a tove, borogove, or rath. We don't know what Rafin is. Rafin *could* be a tove. If Rafin is a tove, then \"Rafin isn't a tove\" would be false.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n3.  **Not all toves chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   We are told \"Rafin chortled at *every* tove.\" This tells us about Rafin's action towards toves, not toves' actions towards Rafin.\n    *   We have no information about whether toves chortled at Rafin. It's possible all toves chortled at Rafin, or none did, or some did.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n4.  **A tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, we have no information about toves chortling at Rafin.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n5.  **Every tove chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3 and 4, we have no information about toves chortling at Rafin.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n6.  **No toves chortled at Rafin.**\n    *   Similar to statement 3, 4, and 5, we have no information about toves chortling at Rafin.\n    *   **This statement is not necessarily true.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the given information, only statement 1 can be definitively concluded as true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) (exclusively). This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these three categories.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Zindle's Property:** Zindle is uffish (U).\n4.  **Rafin's Tove Status:** It is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove. This means Rafin *is* a tove. (R is T)\n5.  **Rafin's Action 1:** Rafin chortled at Zindle (C(R, Z)).\n6.  **Rafin's Uffish Status:** It is not the case that Rafin is uffish. This means Rafin *is not* uffish. (R is not U)\n7.  **Rafin's Action 2 & Bungo's Action:** Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin (not C(R, R)) only if Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Rafin (not S(B, R)).\n    This is a conditional statement: (not C(R, R)) => (not S(B, R)).\n    The contrapositive is also true: S(B, R) => C(R, R).\n\n**Derived Information:**\n\n*   From (3) and (4): Zindle is U. Rafin is T.\n*   From (6): Rafin is not U.\n*   Since Rafin is T and Rafin is not U, we know that there exists at least one tove (Rafin) that is not uffish.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each of the numbered statements based on our derived information:\n\n1.  **Every tove is uffish.**\n    *   We know Rafin is a tove (from 4) and Rafin is *not* uffish (from 6).\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n2.  **Every tove is uffish or no toves are uffish.**\n    *   This is a disjunction.\n    *   \"Every tove is uffish\" is false (as shown in 1).\n    *   \"No toves are uffish\" means that for all toves, they are not uffish. This would imply Rafin (a tove) is not uffish, which is true. But it also implies Zindle (which is uffish) is not a tove. We don't know Zindle's category.\n    *   However, the statement is a logical tautology of the form \"P or not P\" if we consider \"Every tove is uffish\" as P and \"No toves are uffish\" as not P. But \"No toves are uffish\" is not the direct negation of \"Every tove is uffish\". The negation of \"Every tove is uffish\" is \"Not every tove is uffish\" or \"Some tove is not uffish\".\n    *   We know \"Every tove is uffish\" is false.\n    *   We know \"Some tove is not uffish\" is true (Rafin).\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the disjunction: (All T are U) OR (No T are U).\n        *   We know (All T are U) is false.\n        *   Do we know (No T are U) is true? If (No T are U) is true, then Zindle (which is U) cannot be a Tove. We don't have information about Zindle's category.\n        *   Since we know \"Some tove is not uffish\" (Rafin), the first part of the disjunction is false.\n        *   If Zindle is a tove, then \"No toves are uffish\" would be false. If Zindle is not a tove, then \"No toves are uffish\" *could* be true. We don't have enough information to confirm or deny \"No toves are uffish\".\n        *   However, the statement is \"Every tove is uffish or no toves are uffish\". This is a statement about the *entire set* of toves. It's saying either all of them have the property, or none of them do. It excludes the possibility that some do and some don't.\n        *   We know Rafin is a tove and not uffish. So, \"Every tove is uffish\" is false.\n        *   We know Zindle is uffish. If Zindle is a tove, then \"No toves are uffish\" is false. If Zindle is a borogove or a rath, then \"No toves are uffish\" *could* be true.\n        *   Since we have a tove (Rafin) that is *not* uffish, and we have an entity (Zindle) that *is* uffish, if Zindle *were* a tove, then neither \"Every tove is uffish\" nor \"No toves are uffish\" would be true.\n        *   The problem asks what *must* be true. We cannot definitively say that Zindle is not a tove. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that \"No toves are uffish\" is true.\n        *   Since the first part is false, and the second part is not necessarily true, the entire disjunction is not necessarily true.\n        *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n3.  **A tove is uffish.**\n    *   This means \"At least one tove is uffish.\"\n    *   We know Zindle is uffish.\n    *   We do *not* know if Zindle is a tove. Zindle could be a borogove or a rath.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"A tove is uffish\" must be true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n4.  **Not all toves are uffish.**\n    *   This is equivalent to \"Some tove is not uffish.\"\n    *   We know Rafin is a tove (from 4).\n    *   We know Rafin is *not* uffish (from 6).\n    *   Therefore, there exists at least one tove (Rafin) that is not uffish.\n    *   Therefore, this statement **must be true**.\n\n5.  **No toves are uffish.**\n    *   This means \"For every tove, it is not uffish.\"\n    *   We know Zindle is uffish.\n    *   We do *not* know if Zindle is a tove. If Zindle *were* a tove, then this statement would be false. Since we don't know Zindle's category, we cannot definitively say this statement is true.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n6.  **Only toves are uffish.**\n    *   This means \"If something is uffish, then it is a tove.\"\n    *   We know Zindle is uffish.\n    *   If this statement were true, then Zindle *must* be a tove.\n    *   However, we do not have any information that forces Zindle to be a tove. Zindle could be a borogove or a rath and still be uffish, and this statement would then be false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 4 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",

(Let's denote \"X galumphed over Y\" as G(X, Y)). So, $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists r \\in R$ such that G(t, r).\n4.  **Tove-Bungo Interaction (Negative):** No toves galumphed over Bungo. This means for all toves t, it is NOT the case that G(t, Bungo). ($\\forall t \\in T, \\neg G(t, \\text{Bungo})$).\n5.  **Borogove-Zindle Interaction:** Every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle. (Let's denote \"X snicker-snacked Y\" as S(X, Y)). So, $\\forall b \\in B, S(b, \\text{Zindle})$.\n6.  **Uffish Borogove Condition:** A borogove is uffish (U) if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.

This means that for any tove 't', G(t, Bungo) is false.\n*   Statement 1 claims G(Bungo, t) for some tove 't'.\n*   The information given only tells us about toves galumphing over Bungo, not Bungo galumphing over toves. There's no direct or indirect information to confirm or deny this.\n*   **Conclusion: Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**Statement 2: Zindle is uffish.**\n*   The definition of \"uffish\" is only given for borogoves (Statement 6). It states \"A borogove is uffish just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n*   We have no definition or condition for Zindle itself being uffish. Zindle is an entity, not a type of creature (tove, borogove, rath).\n*   **Conclusion: Cannot be determined as true.** (This statement is ill-formed based on the provided definitions).\n\n**Statement 3: Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.**\n*   From (4), we know \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This means that for *every* tove, it did *not* galumph over Bungo.\n*   If \"no toves galumphed over Bungo\" is true, then it is certainly true that \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo\" (because *none* of them did).\n*   **Conclusion: Must be true.**\n\n**Statement 4: A tove galumphed over Bungo.**\n*   From (4), we know \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This directly contradicts Statement 4.\n*   **Conclusion: Must be false.** (Therefore, it cannot be true).\n\n**Statement 5: Bungo galumphed over every tove.**\n*   Similar to Statement 1, the given information (4) only tells us about toves galumphing over Bungo, not Bungo galumphing over toves.\n*   There's no information to confirm or deny this.\n*   **Conclusion: Cannot be determined as true.**\n\n**Statement 6: Every tove galumphed over Bungo.**\n*   From (4), we know \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This means that for *every* tove, it is *not* the case that it galumphed over Bungo.\n*   Statement 6 claims the opposite: that every tove *did* galumph over Bungo.\n*   **Conclusion: Must be false.** (Therefore, it cannot be true).\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   Statement 3 is the only one that directly follows from the given information. \"No toves galumphed over Bungo\" implies that it's not the case that *some* tove galumphed over Bungo, and therefore it's not the case that *all* toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   $\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t, b)$\n    *   This is the converse of premise 3. Premise 3 says there's *one* borogove snicker-snacked by *all* toves. This statement says there's *one* tove that snicker-snacked *all* borogoves. These are not equivalent.\n    *   Consider a scenario: T = {t1, t2}, B = {b1, b2}.\n        *   Premise 3: t1 snicker-snacked b1, t2 snicker-snacked b1. (b1 is the $b_0$)\n        *   This statement: Does there exist a tove that snicker-snacked b1 AND b2? Not necessarily. t1 might not snicker-snack b2, and t2 might not snicker-snack b2.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **2. A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   $\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t, b)$\n    *   From Premise 3: $\\exists b_0 \\in B, \\forall t \\in T, \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t, b_0)$.\n    *   Since there is at least one tove ($|T| \\ge 1$), let $t_1$ be an arbitrary tove.\n    *   From Premise 3, we know that $t_1$ snicker-snacked $b_0$.\n    *   Therefore, there exists a tove ($t_1$) and there exists a borogove ($b_0$) such that $t_1$ snicker-snacked $b_0$.\n    *   This statement **must be true**.\n\n*   **3. There is a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked.**\n    *   $\\exists t_0 \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t_0, b)$\n    *   This is identical to statement 1.\n    *   As shown for statement 1, this is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **4. No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t, b))$\n    *   Equivalently: $\\forall t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, \\neg \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t, b)$\n    *   This is the negation of statement 1 (and 3).\n    *   Since statement 1 is not necessarily true, its negation is also not necessarily true. We can construct scenarios where statement 1 is true (e.g., if T={t1}, B={b1, b2}, and t1 snicker-snacked b1 and b2), and scenarios where it's false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n*   **5. No toves snicker-snacked a borogove.**\n    *   $\\neg (\\exists t \\in T, \\exists b \\in B, \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t, b))$\n    *   Equivalently: $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\neg \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t, b)$\n    *   This is the negation of statement 2.\n    *   Since statement 2 *must* be true, its negation *must* be false.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true** (in fact, it must be false).\n\n*   **6. Every tove snicker-snacked every borogove.**\n    *   $\\forall t \\in T, \\forall b \\in B, \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t, b)$\n    *   This is a very strong statement.\n    *   Premise 3 states: $\\exists b_0 \\in B, \\forall t \\in T, \\text{SnickerSnacked}(t, b_0)$. This means all toves snicker-snacked *one specific* borogove ($b_0$). It does *not* mean they snicker-snacked *all* borogoves.\n    *   Consider T = {t1}, B = {b1, b2}.\n        *   Premise 3: t1 snicker-snacked b1. (b1 is $b_0$)\n        *   This statement: t1 snicker-snacked b1 AND t1 snicker-snacked b2. This is not guaranteed by premise 3.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement 2 can be logically deduced from the given premises.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

There's at least one of each.\n*   **Rath chortled at Bungo:** R_x chortled at Bungo (where R_x is some rath).\n*   **Borogove properties:** A borogove is uffish (B -> U). Only borogoves gyred (G -> B).\n*   **Rafin chortled at Zindle:** Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n*   **Every rath chortled at Zindle:** For all R_y, R_y chortled at Zindle.\n*   **Tove properties:** Tove is uffish unless Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle. (T -> U OR Bungo chortled at Zindle). This can be rephrased as: (T AND NOT U) -> Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle. Or, if Bungo chortled at Zindle, then all toves are uffish.\n*   **Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo:** Bungo did not snicker-snack Bungo. (This seems like a distractor, as it doesn't connect to other statements directly).\n*   **Rafin isn't uffish:** NOT (Rafin is uffish).\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n1.  **Rafin's Category:** We know \"Only borogoves gyred\" (G -> B) and \"A borogove is uffish\" (B -> U). We also know \"Rafin isn't uffish\".\n    *   Since Rafin isn't uffish, Rafin cannot be a borogove (because all borogoves are uffish).\n    *   Therefore, Rafin must be either a tove or a rath.\n\n2.  **Chortling at Zindle:** We are given two crucial pieces of information:\n    *   \"Rafin chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n\n3.  **Combining Chortling Information:**\n    *   If Rafin is a rath, then Rafin chortled at Zindle (given) and this is consistent with \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n    *   If Rafin is a tove, then Rafin chortled at Zindle (given). This doesn't contradict \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" because Rafin wouldn't be a rath in this case.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options based on \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\":**\n    *   **1. No raths chortled at Zindle.** This directly contradicts \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" So, this is false.\n    *   **2. A rath chortled at Zindle.** If \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" is true, and we know there's at least one rath, then it must be true that \"A rath chortled at Zindle.\" This statement is a direct consequence of the given information.\n    *   **4. Not all raths chortled at Zindle.** This directly contradicts \"Every rath chortled at Zindle.\" So, this is false.\n\n5.  **Evaluating other options:**\n    *   **3. Zindle chortled at a rath.** We know raths chortled at Zindle, but we have no information about Zindle chortling at anyone, let alone a rath. This is not necessarily true.\n    *   **5. Zindle gyred.** We know \"Only borogoves gyred.\" We have no information about Zindle's category or if Zindle gyred. This is not necessarily true.\n    *   **6. Zindle chortled at every rath.** Similar to option 3, we have no information about Zindle chortling at anyone. This is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe statement \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" is explicitly given in the problem description.\nIf \"Every rath chortled at Zindle\" is true, and we know there's at least one rath, then it logically follows that \"A rath chortled at Zindle.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

(This is a direct, unambiguous statement).\n7.  **Mimsy:** Only toves are mimsy. This means:\n    *   If something is mimsy, then it is a tove.\n    *   Conversely, if something is *not* a tove, then it is *not* mimsy.\n    *   Since borogoves are not toves (due to exclusivity), no borogoves are mimsy.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 1: Bungo chortled at Bungo and every borogove is uffish.**\n*   \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\": This is directly stated in point 6. (TRUE)\n*   \"every borogove is uffish\": This is directly stated in point 3. (TRUE)\n*   Since both parts are true, the conjunction is **TRUE**.\n\n**Statement 2: Every borogove is mimsy just in case not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n*   \"Every borogove is mimsy\": From point 7 (\"Only toves are mimsy\") and point 1 (exclusivity), borogoves are *not* toves, so borogoves cannot be mimsy. Therefore, \"Every borogove is mimsy\" is **FALSE**.\n*   \"not all borogoves are mimsy\": Since *no* borogoves are mimsy, it is certainly true that \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" (in fact, *none* are). So, \"not all borogoves are mimsy\" is **TRUE**.\n*   The statement is of the form \"False just in case True\". A biconditional (just in case) is true only if both sides have the same truth value.

Therefore, it is also **FALSE**.\n\n**Statement 4: A borogove is uffish but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n*   \"A borogove is uffish\": Since \"Every borogove is uffish\" (point 3) and \"there's at least one borogove\" (point 2), it must be true that \"A borogove is uffish\". (TRUE)\n*   \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo\": This means \"Bungo did not chortle at Bungo\". However, point 6 explicitly states \"Bungo chortled at Bungo\". So, this part is **FALSE**.\n*   The statement is of the form \"True but False\". A conjunction (\"but\" implies \"and\") is true only if both parts are true. Since one part is false, the conjunction is **FALSE**.\n\n**Statement 5: Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and every borogove is uffish.**\n*   \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo\": This contradicts point 6 (\"Bungo chortled at Bungo\").

            "raw_response": "Let's break down the given information and analyze each statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Categories:** Everything is a tove (T), or a borogove (B), or a rath (R) exclusively. This means an entity belongs to exactly one of these categories.\n2.  **Existence:** There's at least one of each (T, B, R).\n3.  **Toves & Borogoves:** No toves chortled at every borogove.\n    *   Symbolically: $\\neg \\exists t \\in T \\forall b \\in B (\\text{chortled}(t, b))$\n    *   This is equivalent to: $\\forall t \\in T \\exists b \\in B (\\neg \\text{chortled}(t, b))$ (For every tove, there's at least one borogove it didn't chortle at).\n4.  **Raths & Bungo:** Every rath gimbled but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n    *   Symbolically: $\\forall r \\in R (\\text{gimbled}(r)) \\land \\neg \\text{chortled}(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo})$\n    *   This means: All raths gimbled is true.\n    *   And: Bungo did not chortle at Bungo is true.\n5.  **Bungo & Zindle & Rafin:** Bungo chortled at Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin isn't beamish.\n    *   Symbolically: $\\text{chortled}(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Zindle}) \\land \\neg (\\neg \\text{beamish}(\\text{Rafin}))$\n    *   This means: Bungo chortled at Zindle is true.\n    *   And: Rafin is beamish is true.\n\n**Summary of Key Deductions from Given Information:**\n\n*   **D1:** All raths gimbled. ($\\forall r \\in R (\\text{gimbled}(r))$)\n*   **D2:** Bungo did not chortle at Bungo. ($\\neg \\text{chortled}(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Bungo})$)\n*   **D3:** Bungo chortled at Zindle. ($\\text{chortled}(\\text{Bungo}, \\text{Zindle})$)\n*   **D4:** Rafin is beamish. ($\\text{beamish}(\\text{Rafin})$)\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n---\n\n**Statement 1: Not all raths gimbled just in case Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n\n*   \"Not all raths gimbled\" is equivalent to \"It is not the case that every rath gimbled.\"\n    *   From D1, we know \"Every rath gimbled\" is TRUE.\n    *   Therefore, \"Not all raths gimbled\" is FALSE.\n*   \"Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo\" is equivalent to \"$\\neg \\text{chortled}(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Bungo})$\". We have no information about this, so its truth value is unknown.\n*   The statement is of the form \"A just in case B\", which means \"A if and only if B\" ($A \\leftrightarrow B$).\n    *   So, it's (FALSE) $\\leftrightarrow$ (UNKNOWN).\n    *   If UNKNOWN is TRUE, then FALSE $\\leftrightarrow$ TRUE is FALSE.\n    *   If UNKNOWN is FALSE, then FALSE $\\leftrightarrow$ FALSE is TRUE.\n*   Since the truth value depends on an unknown, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 2: If a rath chortled at Zindle, then Bungo gimbled.**\n\n*   This is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q\".\n*   P: \"a rath chortled at Zindle\" ($\\exists r \\in R (\\text{chortled}(r, \\text{Zindle}))$). We have no information about this, so its truth value is unknown.\n*   Q: \"Bungo gimbled\" ($\\text{gimbled}(\\text{Bungo})$). We have no information about whether Bungo gimbled. Bungo could be a tove, borogove, or rath. If Bungo is a rath, then Bungo gimbled (by D1). If Bungo is a tove or borogove, we don't know. So, Q is unknown.\n*   Since both P and Q are unknown, the implication P $\\rightarrow$ Q is **not necessarily true**. (e.g., if P is true and Q is false, the statement is false).\n\n---\n\n**Statement 3: Every rath gimbled and Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   This is a conjunction: \"A and B\".\n*   A: \"Every rath gimbled\". From D1, this is TRUE.\n*   B: \"Bungo chortled at Zindle\". From D3, this is TRUE.\n*   Since both A and B are TRUE, the conjunction (TRUE and TRUE) is TRUE.\n*   This statement **must be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 4: A rath chortled at Zindle only if Bungo gimbled.**\n\n*   \"A only if B\" is equivalent to \"If A, then B\".\n*   A: \"A rath chortled at Zindle\" ($\\exists r \\in R (\\text{chortled}(r, \\text{Zindle}))$). Unknown.\n*   B: \"Bungo gimbled\" ($\\text{gimbled}(\\text{Bungo})$). Unknown.\n*   This is the same as Statement 2. Since both parts are unknown, the implication is **not necessarily true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 5: Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case a rath gimbled.**\n\n*   \"A just in case B\" means \"A if and only if B\" ($A \\leftrightarrow B$).\n*   A: \"Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo\" ($\\neg \\text{chortled}(\\text{Zindle}, \\text{Bungo})$). Unknown.\n*   B: \"a rath gimbled\" ($\\exists r \\in R (\\text{gimbled}(r))$).\n    *   From D1, we know \"Every rath gimbled\". If every rath gimbled, then it must be true that \"a rath gimbled\" (since there's at least one rath). So, B is TRUE.\n*   The statement is (UNKNOWN) $\\leftrightarrow$ (TRUE).\n    *   If UNKNOWN is TRUE, then TRUE $\\leftrightarrow$ TRUE is TRUE.\n    *   If UNKNOWN is FALSE, then FALSE $\\leftrightarrow$ TRUE is FALSE.\n*   Since the truth value depends on an unknown, this statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n---\n\n**Statement 6: Every rath gimbled but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Zindle.**\n\n*   \"A but B\" is equivalent to \"A and B\".\n*   A: \"Every rath gimbled\". From D1, this is TRUE.\n*   B: \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Zindle\".\n    *   From D3, we know \"Bungo chortled at Zindle\" is TRUE.\n    *   Therefore, \"it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Zindle\" is FALSE.\n*   The statement is (TRUE and FALSE), which is FALSE.\n*   This statement **must be false**, and therefore not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement 3 must be true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",
