Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Every donkey saw a monkey.\n4. A human saw a human that saw a donkey.\n5. Hazel saw a human.\n6. Hazel didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n7. Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every donkey saw every monkey.\n- This statement is too strong. It would mean that every single donkey saw every single monkey, which isn't necessarily implied by the given information. We only know that every donkey saw at least one monkey, but not necessarily all monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys saw a monkey.\n- This contradicts the given information that \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: There is a donkey that every monkey saw.\n- From the information that \"Every donkey saw a monkey,\" we can infer that there exists at least one donkey that saw at least one monkey. However, this doesn't guarantee that there is a specific donkey that saw every monkey. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey saw a monkey.\n- This is directly supported by the information that \"Every donkey saw a monkey.\" Since there is at least one donkey, it follows that at least one donkey saw a monkey. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey saw every monkey.\n- This is stronger than what we have. The information only guarantees that every donkey saw at least one monkey, but not necessarily every monkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys saw every monkey.\n- This is also contradictory to the given information. If every donkey saw a monkey, then there must be at least one donkey that saw every monkey. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 4: A donkey saw a monkey.**",

Therefore, Alfred must be a monkey.\n\n2. **Every monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - Hazel saw all three monkeys (M1, M2, and D). However, we do not know if every monkey saw Hazel. It could be that M1 and M2 did not see Hazel, for example. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel saw all three monkeys (M1, M2, and D), and M1 and M2 are monkeys, it follows that at least one monkey (either M1 or M2) saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel saw all three monkeys (M1, M2, and D), it is false that not all monkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts the fact that Hazel saw all three monkeys. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a monkey.**\n   - Hazel saw all three monkeys (M1, M2, and D). Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nIn summary, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- 3. A monkey saw Hazel.\n- 6. Hazel saw a monkey.\n\nFinal Answer: 3, 6",

However, since Hazel is a monkey (as it is the only non-human entity mentioned), this condition doesn't affect Hazel directly.\n5. **Every monkey ate**: Since Hazel is a monkey and Hazel saw Hazel, Hazel must have eaten.\n6. **Hazel saw Hazel**: This is redundant as Hazel saw herself, which is always true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Not all monkeys will run and only humans ate**:\n   - We know that Hazel is a monkey and Hazel ate, so this statement is false because it claims only humans ate.\n   \n2. **Hazel will run**:\n   - The information provided does not give us any direct indication about Hazel running or not running.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. There is a donkey that every human kicked.\n4. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n5. A human saw Lewis and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human kicked a donkey.\n- From point 3, we know there is a specific donkey that every human kicked. This implies that at least one human kicked this particular donkey. However, it does not necessarily mean that every human kicked every donkey. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey kicked a human.\n- We do not have any direct information about donkeys kicking humans. The only information we have is that humans kicked a specific donkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- Similar to Statement 2, we do not have any information that suggests every donkey kicked every human. The only information we have is that a specific donkey was kicked by every human. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- Again, similar to Statements 2 and 3, we do not have any information suggesting that every donkey kicked a human. The only information we have is that a specific donkey was kicked by every human. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey kicked every human.\n- This statement is also not necessarily true based on the given information. We only know that a specific donkey was kicked by every human, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every human.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- This statement can be concluded from the given information. Since we know that a specific donkey was kicked by every human, it means that not every donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every human.**",

Therefore, we cannot conclude that a human saw Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every human saw Hazel.\n- This would imply that every single human saw Hazel. However, we only know that at least one human saw a donkey, and no additional information suggests that every human saw Hazel. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel saw every human.\n- Similar to Statement 2, we do not have any information suggesting that Hazel saw every human. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No humans saw Hazel.\n- This would mean that none of the humans saw Hazel. However, we know that a human saw a donkey (Statement 3), which implies that at least one human saw something. Since Hazel is a part of the \"everything\" category, it is possible that a human saw Hazel. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all humans saw Hazel.\n- This aligns with the information provided: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred,\" which implies that not all humans saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel saw a human.\n- We know that Hazel isn't a human (from Statement 5, since not all humans saw Hazel). Therefore, Hazel could not have seen a human. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: Not all humans saw Hazel.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Every donkey chased every human.\n4. Alfred didn't chase Alfred, which means Alfred is not a donkey (since donkeys chase everyone).\n5. It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey, meaning Lewis is a donkey.\n6. No humans are asleep unless all monkeys chased Lewis.\n7. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n8. Only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analyzing Each Statement:\n\n**Statement 1: Alfred isn't a human.**\n- From point 4, we know Alfred is not a donkey.\n- Since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and Alfred is not a donkey, Alfred must be a human.\n- This contradicts the statement that Alfred isn't a human.\n- Therefore, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred is asleep.**\n- From point 7, we know not all donkeys chased Alfred. Since Alfred is a human, he cannot be a donkey.\n- From point 6, we know not all donkeys chased Alfred, so Alfred could be a human who was not chased by any donkeys.\n- However, from point 8, only donkeys are asleep.\n- Therefore, Alfred cannot be asleep.\n- Statement 2 must be false.\n\n**Statement 3: Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n- We already determined that Alfred is not asleep.\n- Lewis is a donkey (from point 5).\n- Donkeys are not asleep (point 8).\n- Therefore, Alfred and Lewis cannot both be asleep.\n- Statement 3 must be false.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred is a human.**\n- As established earlier, Alfred is not a donkey (point 4).\n- Alfred is not a human (point 1 contradicts this).\n- Therefore, Alfred must be a monkey.\n- Statement 4 must be false.\n\n**Statement 5: Lewis is asleep.**\n- Lewis is a donkey (point 5).\n- Donkeys are not asleep (point 8).\n- Therefore, Lewis cannot be asleep.\n- Statement 5 must be false.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred isn't asleep.**\n- Alfred is not a donkey (point 4).\n- Donkeys are not asleep (point 8).\n- Therefore, Alfred cannot be asleep.\n- Statement 6 must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is **Statement 6: Alfred isn't asleep**.",

There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n4. Lewis saw Alfred.\n5. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n6. Lewis didn't chase Hazel.\n7. Not all humans kicked Alfred.\n8. If every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From condition 3, we know that Hazel did not chase Alfred.\n- From condition 4, we know that Lewis saw Alfred.\n- From condition 5, we know that not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n- From condition 6, we know that Lewis did not chase Hazel.\n- From condition 7, we know that not all humans kicked Alfred.\n- From condition 8, if every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The condition about monkeys chasing Lewis does not directly affect whether Alfred kicked Hazel or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel didn't chase Alfred and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n- We know from condition 3 that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n- We know from condition 5 that not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n- Both parts of the statement are true based on the given conditions. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel didn't chase Alfred and every monkey kicked Lewis.\n- We know from condition 3 that Hazel didn\u2019t chase Alfred.\n- However, we do not have enough information to conclude that every monkey kicked Lewis. It could be that some monkeys kicked Lewis, but not all. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n- We do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred didn't kick Hazel. The statement \"If Alfred didn't kick Hazel\" is not supported by the given conditions. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: If every monkey chased Hazel, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n- We do not have enough information to determine whether every monkey chased Hazel.

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis didn't chase Hazel and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n- We know from condition 6 that Lewis did not chase Hazel.\n- We do not have enough information to determine whether a monkey kicked Alfred.

Alfred doesn't see Alfred.\n4. If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if Lewis is a donkey.\n5. A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.\n6. Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred is asleep.\n- From the information, we know Alfred isn't asleep. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 2: A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Alfred isn't asleep.\n- We know Alfred isn't asleep, so this part of the statement is true. However, we do not have enough information about whether a human saw Lewis. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n- This statement involves conditional logic. Let's assume \"not all humans are asleep\" means some humans are awake. Since Alfred isn't asleep, he could still see Lewis even if some humans are awake. The condition \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis only if Alfred saw Alfred\" is logically equivalent to saying \"If Alfred sees Lewis, then Alfred didn't see Alfred.\" This is a contradiction because Alfred can't see himself. Hence, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human is asleep.\n- Alfred isn't asleep, so the second part of the disjunction is false. Therefore, for the entire statement to be true, Alfred must see Lewis. However, we don't have direct information about whether Alfred sees Lewis. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.\n- We know a human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless a human is asleep.\n- We know Alfred isn't asleep, so the condition \"unless a human is asleep\" does not apply here. Therefore, Alfred could see Lewis regardless of whether a human is asleep. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (and no other categories).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. No humans kicked any monkeys.\n4. Donkeys did not kick Hazel.\n5. If Alfred is asleep, then a donkey must have kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n- For Alfred and Lewis to both be asleep, Alfred must be asleep, which means a donkey must have kicked Hazel (from point 5).\n- However, we do not have any information about whether a donkey kicked Hazel or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred and Lewis are both asleep.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred isn't asleep.\n- For Alfred not to be asleep, it does not necessarily mean that a donkey did not kick Hazel. The condition for Alfred being asleep is that a donkey must have kicked Hazel, but it doesn't preclude him from being awake if no donkey kicked Hazel.\n- Thus, we cannot definitively say Alfred isn't asleep based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred and Hazel are asleep.\n- Similar to Statement 1, for Alfred and Hazel to both be asleep, Alfred must be asleep, meaning a donkey must have kicked Hazel.\n- Again, we lack information about whether a donkey kicked Hazel, so we cannot conclude that Alfred and Hazel are both asleep.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred is asleep.\n- As mentioned above, for Alfred to be asleep, a donkey must have kicked Hazel.\n- We do not have any direct information about whether a donkey kicked Hazel, so we cannot definitively say Alfred is asleep.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis is asleep.\n- This statement is independent of Alfred and focuses solely on Lewis.\n- We do not have any information about Lewis or whether he is asleep or not. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Lewis is asleep or not.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided statements can be conclusively determined as true based on the given information. Therefore, none of the statements must be true.\n\nFinal Answer: None of the statements must be true.",

Additionally, it states that not all donkeys will run.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Hazel didn't eat.**\n   - Since only donkeys ate, and Hazel could be a human or a monkey, she did not eat. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **Hazel won't run.**\n   - The statement \"not all donkeys will run\" does not provide enough information about Hazel specifically. It only tells us that not all donkeys will run, but Hazel could be a human or a monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel won't run.\n\n3. **Hazel ate.**\n   - As mentioned earlier, Hazel could be a human or a monkey, but since only donkeys ate, Hazel did not eat. This statement must be false.\n\n4. **Hazel is a donkey.**\n   - Hazel could be a human or a monkey, so we cannot definitively say she is a donkey.

Since no donkeys saw Lewis, the condition \"a monkey saw Alfred only if a donkey saw Lewis\" does not hold because there are no donkeys who saw Lewis. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred won't attack.\n- We know that Lewis and Alfred will attack. Therefore, Alfred will attack.

Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: If a monkey saw Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis.\n- From the information, we know that no donkeys saw Lewis.

            "raw_response": "To solve this problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (and only these three categories).\n2. There is at least one of each category: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n4. No humans are hungry.\n5. If every donkey saw Hazel, then every monkey saw Lewis.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n- From the given information, we know that no humans are hungry. Since Alfred and Lewis could potentially be donkeys or monkeys, we cannot conclude that they are necessarily hungry based on the provided information. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred is hungry.\n- Similar to Statement 1, since no humans are hungry, Alfred could be a donkey or a monkey. We do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred is hungry or not. Thus, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\n- The information states that no humans are hungry. Therefore, Hazel being hungry or not does not affect the fact that no humans are hungry. Hence, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no humans are hungry.\n- This statement is directly related to the given information. Since no humans are hungry, it follows logically that Alfred doesn't see Hazel because no humans are present to see Hazel. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n- The given information tells us that if every donkey saw Hazel, then every monkey saw Lewis. However, this does not provide any direct information about Alfred seeing Hazel or any other specific conditions involving humans. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel are hungry.\n- Since no humans are hungry, Alfred and Hazel could be donkeys or monkeys. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that they are hungry or not. Therefore, this statement does not have to be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no humans are hungry.**",

Alfred might have seen only some humans, or he might not have seen any humans at all.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred saw a human.\n- Since there is at least one human and a human saw a human that saw a monkey, it implies that there is at least one human who saw a human (which could be Alfred).\n- Even though we do not have direct evidence that Alfred saw a specific human, it is possible that Alfred saw a human.\n- Therefore, this statement can be considered true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans saw Alfred.\n- We know that a human saw a human that saw a monkey. This means there is at least one human who saw a human (which could be Alfred).\n- Therefore, it is impossible for no humans to have seen Alfred.\n- Hence, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred is a donkey.\n- The problem states that everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey. Alfred being a donkey would contradict the fact that a human saw a human that saw a monkey.\n- Therefore, Alfred cannot be a donkey.\n- Hence, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human saw Alfred.\n- As discussed earlier, since there is at least one human who saw a human (which could be Alfred), it is possible that a human saw Alfred.\n- Therefore, this statement can be considered true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all humans saw Alfred.\n- We know that a human saw a human that saw a monkey. This means there is at least one human who saw a human (which could be Alfred).\n- It is possible that only one human saw Alfred, or multiple humans did not see Alfred.\n- Therefore, it is possible that not all humans saw Alfred.\n- Hence, this statement can be considered true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n2.

However, we know that Hazel saw Alfred and no humans will run. Since the condition for Alfred running requires every human to have seen Hazel, and since no humans will run, this condition is satisfied. Therefore, Alfred won't run. This statement must be true.\n\n### Statement 2: Alfred and Hazel will run.\n- We already determined that Alfred won't run. For Hazel to run, every human would need to have seen Hazel, which is not the case because no humans will run. Therefore, Hazel won't run either. This statement is false.\n\n### Statement 3: Alfred isn't hungry and Hazel saw Alfred.\n- We know that Alfred isn't hungry from the given information. Also, Hazel saw Alfred as stated. This statement is true.\n\n### Statement 4: Hazel will run.\n- As discussed, Hazel won't run because no humans will run, and therefore, the condition for Hazel to run is not met. This statement is false.\n\n### Statement 5: Alfred will run.\n- As established, Alfred won't run. This statement is false.\n\n### Statement 6: Alfred isn't hungry but it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred.\n- We know Alfred isn't hungry, but we also know that Hazel did see Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n1. Alfred won't run.\n3. Alfred isn't hungry and Hazel saw Alfred.\n\nFinal Answer: 1, 3",

Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred will run.**\n- Similar to Statement 1, we do not have enough information about whether Alfred will run or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n**Statement 3: Lewis ate and only humans will run.**\n- From point 3, we know Lewis ate something, which aligns with the first part of the statement. However, point 4 tells us that no humans will run, so it is impossible for only humans to run. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n**Statement 4: A human will attack and no humans will attack.**\n- This statement is contradictory because it claims both a human will attack and no humans will attack simultaneously. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Lewis ate and no humans will run.**\n- From point 3, we know Lewis ate something, which aligns with the first part of the statement. From point 4, we know no humans will run, which aligns with the second part of the statement. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n- We do not have enough information about whether Alfred and Hazel will run or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 5: Lewis ate and no humans will run.**",

However, since there are multiple donkeys and each donkey kicks another donkey, this statement cannot be true because it would require a specific donkey to be the target of all other donkeys' kicks, which is not specified.\n\n5. **Every donkey kicked every donkey.**\n   - This would mean that every donkey kicked every other donkey. Given that \"every donkey kicked a donkey,\" it is possible for every donkey to kick every other donkey, but we do not have enough information to confirm this.

We know no donkeys saw Hazel, but we don't have any information about other humans.

We still lack specific information about other humans and donkeys' interactions with them. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys saw every human.\n- This statement is a reasonable conclusion because we know no donkeys saw Hazel, and we don't have any information suggesting that a donkey saw every human.

Therefore, Alfred must be the one who won't attack.\n- This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Hazel will attack.\n- We already determined that Alfred won't attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every monkey ate and a human saw Lewis.\n- From statement 4, every monkey ate. From statement 6, a human saw Lewis. \n- This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred will attack.\n- We have already established that Alfred won't attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred and Lewis will attack.\n- Alfred won't attack, and Lewis is a human who will attack. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: No humans ate just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.\n- From statement 4, every monkey ate. From statement 6, a human saw Lewis. \n- Since every monkey ate, none of them could have seen Lewis (because they ate). Thus, the condition \"no humans ate just in case no monkeys saw Lewis\" holds true.\n- This statement must be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1.

This means \\(H_1\\) chased \\(D\\).\n\n4. **Alfred chased a donkey.**\n   - Let's denote Alfred as \\(A\\). So, \\(A\\) chased a donkey, say \\(D_A\\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - This would mean for every monkey \\(M\\), there exists a donkey \\(D\\) such that \\(D\\) chased \\(M\\).\n   - However, from the information given, we only know that every monkey chased every donkey, not necessarily the other way around. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n2. **A donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - From the information given, we know that every monkey chased every donkey, but it does not specify whether a donkey chased a monkey. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n3. **Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n   - Similar to statement 1, this would imply that for every donkey \\(D\\), there exists a monkey \\(M\\) such that \\(D\\) chased \\(M\\).\n   - Again, the information provided does not guarantee this. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n4. **There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n   - This would mean there exists a donkey \\(D\\) such that for every monkey \\(M\\), \\(D\\) chased \\(M\\).\n   - Since every monkey chased every donkey, it follows that there must be at least one donkey that every monkey chased. This statement must be true.\n\n5. **No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n   - This would mean no donkey chased all monkeys.\n   - Given that every monkey chased every donkey, it is impossible for no donkey to chase all monkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n   - This would mean for every donkey \\(D\\), there exists a monkey \\(M\\) such that \\(D\\) chased \\(M\\).\n   - The information given does not provide enough details to conclude this. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 4. There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**",

No humans will run.\n6. Hazel is a monkey.\n7. Every donkey will run.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred isn't asleep but it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey.\n- From the given information, we know Alfred isn't asleep (Statement 4).\n- However, Hazel being a monkey is explicitly stated (Statement 6). Therefore, this statement is false because it contradicts the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Hazel will run.\n- Alfred isn't asleep (Statement 4), so he could potentially run.\n- Hazel is a monkey (Statement 6), and since every monkey will run (Statement 7), Hazel will run.\n- However, we do not have enough information about Alfred running specifically. He could be a donkey or a human, and neither of these categories will run (Statements 5 and 7). Thus, we cannot definitively say Alfred will run.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred won't run.\n- We already established that Alfred isn't asleep (Statement 4), which means he could potentially run.\n- Since we do not have specific information about Alfred's category (donkey, human, or monkey), we cannot definitively say Alfred won't run.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred isn't asleep and Hazel is a monkey.\n- This statement is true based on the given information (Statements 4 and 6).\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred will run.\n- As discussed earlier, we do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred will run or not.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel will run.\n- Hazel is a monkey (Statement 6), and every monkey will run (Statement 7).\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is **Statement 4**.\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 4",

Therefore, Alfred cannot be a donkey. This statement is true.\n\n**Statement 3: Hazel is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n- If Hazel is happy, it doesn't necessarily mean that not all donkeys chased Alfred. It only states that if not all donkeys chased Alfred, then Hazel is happy. The reverse is not necessarily true. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred is a donkey.**\n- Alfred is happy, so he must be either a human or a monkey. Therefore, Alfred cannot be a donkey. This statement is false.\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred isn't happy.**\n- We know Alfred is happy, so this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 6: Hazel is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n- If Hazel is happy, it doesn't necessarily mean that no donkeys chased Alfred. It only states that if no donkeys chased Alfred, then Hazel is happy. The reverse is not necessarily true.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. It is not the case that Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n5. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis, but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all humans kicked Hazel.\n7. If not all donkeys will run, then Lewis won't run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- From statement 4, \"It is not the case that Lewis didn't kick Alfred,\" we know that Lewis kicked Alfred.\n- From statement 5, \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis, but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey,\" we know Lewis is a donkey.\n- From statement 7, \"If not all donkeys will run, then Lewis won't run only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\" Since Lewis is a donkey, he will run unless not all donkeys kicked Hazel. But since no donkeys kicked Hazel (statement 3), it implies that all donkeys kicked Hazel. Therefore, Lewis will run.\n- Since Lewis will run, Alfred will also run because Lewis kicked Alfred (statement 4).\n\n**Conclusion:** Alfred and Lewis will run. Statement 1 is true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred will run.\n- We have already established that Alfred will run as part of statement 1.\n\n**Conclusion:** Alfred will run. Statement 2 is true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel kicked Lewis.\n- From statement 3, \"No donkeys kicked Hazel,\" and since Lewis is a donkey (statement 5), it follows that Hazel did not kick Lewis.\n\n**Conclusion:** Hazel did not kick Lewis. Statement 3 is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis kicked Hazel.\n- We do not have any direct information about Lewis kicking Hazel. The only thing we know is that Lewis kicked Alfred.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot determine from the given information whether Lewis kicked Hazel or not. Statement 4 is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis didn't kick Hazel.\n- As per our analysis, since no donkeys kicked Hazel and Lewis is a donkey, Lewis did not kick Hazel.\n\n**Conclusion:** Lewis didn't kick Hazel. Statement 5 is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel didn't kick Lewis.\n- We have already determined that Hazel did not kick Lewis based on the information provided.\n\n**Conclusion:** Hazel did not kick Lewis. Statement 6 is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Alfred and Lewis will run.\n5. Lewis didn't kick Hazel.\n6. Hazel didn't kick Lewis.",

The information provided does not restrict the behavior of donkeys chasing monkeys. Therefore, it is possible for some donkeys to chase every monkey. Hence, this statement may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A monkey chased a donkey.\n- From the given information, we know that \"Every monkey chased a donkey.\" This directly implies that at least one monkey chased a donkey. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- The information provided does not specify whether every donkey chased a monkey. It only states that every monkey chased a donkey. Therefore, this statement may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- Similar to Statement 3, the information provided does not specify whether every donkey chased every monkey. It only states that every monkey was chased by a donkey. Therefore, this statement may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- Again, the information provided does not specify whether every donkey chased every monkey. It only states that every monkey was chased by a donkey. Therefore, this statement may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. While it is true that every monkey was chased by a donkey, it does not imply that every donkey chased a monkey. Therefore, this statement may not be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 2: A monkey chased a donkey.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (and only these three categories).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Every monkey saw a human that saw it.\n4. Alfred drank unless every human saw Hazel.\n5. A monkey is hungry.\n6. Lewis isn't happy.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human saw every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every monkey was seen by at least one human.\n- From the information that \"Every monkey saw a human that saw it,\" we know that for every monkey, there exists at least one human who saw it.\n- However, this does not necessarily mean that every human saw every monkey. It could be that some humans saw multiple monkeys, while others saw fewer or none.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every human saw a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every human saw at least one monkey.\n- The information provided does not give us enough details about which humans saw which monkeys.\n- We know that every monkey saw a human, but this doesn't imply that every human saw a monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every human saw every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every human saw all the monkeys.\n- Again, the information provided does not guarantee that every human saw every monkey.\n- We know that every monkey saw a human, but this doesn't imply that every human saw every monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No humans saw a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that no human saw any monkey.\n- If every monkey saw a human, then it would be impossible for no humans to see any monkeys.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human saw a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that at least one human saw at least one monkey.\n- Since every monkey saw a human, it follows that at least one human must have seen at least one monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No humans saw every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that no human saw all the monkeys.\n- If every monkey saw a human, then it implies that at least one human saw at least one monkey, but it does not necessarily mean that no human saw all the monkeys.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: A human saw a monkey.**",

No humans chased every monkey.\n4. Lewis chased every monkey.\n5. Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel ate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis is a human.\n- From statement 4, we know that Lewis chased every monkey. Since no humans chased every monkey (statement 3), Lewis cannot be a human. If Lewis were a human, he would have been able to chase every monkey, which contradicts statement 3. Therefore, Lewis must not be a human.\n- This statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis didn't eat.\n- We need to consider the condition given for Hazel (statement 5): \"Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel ate.\" \n- If Lewis is not a human, then according to statement 5, Hazel must be a human (since Hazel can't be a human if she ate). However, since there's at least one human (from statement 2), Hazel being a human is possible.\n- But the statement doesn't provide enough information to definitively say whether Hazel ate or not. Thus, we cannot conclude that Lewis didn't eat based on the given information.\n- This statement could be true or false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis ate.\n- Similar to statement 2, we cannot definitively conclude from the given information whether Lewis ate or not. The information provided does not give us enough details about Hazel's actions to determine Lewis's eating habits.\n- This statement could be true or false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis isn't a human.\n- As analyzed above, Lewis cannot be a human because if he were, he would have been able to chase every monkey, contradicting statement 3.\n- This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Hazel ate.\n- We know Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel ate (statement 5). However, without knowing whether Hazel is a human or not, we cannot definitively conclude whether Hazel ate or not.\n- This statement could be true or false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis and Hazel ate.\n- Similar to the previous statements, we do not have enough information to determine whether both Lewis and Hazel ate.\n- This statement could be true or false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 4: Lewis isn't a human.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. No monkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. A monkey kicked a donkey that kicked a donkey.\n5. Every human is happy.\n6. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis is happy.\n- From the given information, we know that every human is happy. Since Lewis is not a donkey, he must be a human. Therefore, Lewis must be happy.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel kicked a monkey.\n- We know no monkeys kicked Hazel, so Hazel could have kicked a donkey or a human.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey kicked Hazel.\n- We know no monkeys kicked Hazel, so a monkey could not have kicked Hazel.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every monkey kicked Hazel.\n- We know no monkeys kicked Hazel, so it is impossible for every monkey to have kicked Hazel.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all monkeys kicked Hazel.\n- Since no monkeys kicked Hazel, it is true that not all monkeys kicked Hazel.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel kicked every monkey.\n- We know no monkeys kicked Hazel, so Hazel could not have kicked every monkey.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement cannot be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1.

No humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step-by-step:\n\n### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis drank.\n- From statement 6, \"Not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\"\n- If every monkey chased Hazel, then not all donkeys drank.\n- Since there is at least one monkey (from statement 2), it follows that not all donkeys drank.\n- However, this does not necessarily mean Alfred and Lewis drank. They could have drunk or not drunk.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred and Lewis drank based on the given information.\n\n### Statement 2: No humans are hungry unless only donkeys drank.\n- This statement is about the relationship between humans being hungry and donkeys drinking.\n- We do not have enough information to determine whether only donkeys drank or not.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that no humans are hungry based on the given information.\n\n### Statement 3: No humans are hungry or only donkeys drank.\n- Similar to statement 2, we lack specific information about the drinking habits of donkeys.\n- Thus, we cannot conclude this statement.\n\n### Statement 4: Not all donkeys drank just in case no humans are hungry.\n- This statement is also about the relationship between donkeys drinking and humans being hungry.\n- Again, we do not have enough information to determine whether no humans are hungry or not.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement.\n\n### Statement 5: Not all humans are hungry and every donkey drank.\n- This statement combines two conditions:\n  - Not all humans are hungry.\n  - Every donkey drank.\n- We know from statement 6 that if every monkey chased Hazel, then not all donkeys drank.\n- Since there is at least one monkey (statement 2), it follows that not all donkeys drank.\n- Therefore, statement 5 cannot be true because it assumes every donkey drank, which contradicts the information given.\n\n### Statement 6: Alfred drank.\n- We do not have any direct information about Alfred drinking or not drinking.\n- The given statements do not provide any specific information about Alfred's actions.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred drank.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided statements must be true based on the given information. \n\nFinal Answer: None of the statements must be true.",

The information provided does not specify that every donkey chased every monkey. It only states that every donkey chased a monkey that chased it. This implies that for each donkey, there is a specific monkey it chased, but it doesn't imply that all donkeys chased all monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement must be true. According to the fourth piece of information, \"Every donkey chased a monkey that chased it.\" Since there is at least one donkey and at least one monkey, there must be at least one donkey that chased a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys chased a monkey.\n- This statement cannot be true. From the analysis of Statement 2, we know that there is at least one donkey that chased a monkey. Therefore, it is impossible for no donkeys to chase monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement cannot be true. The information only specifies that every donkey chased a monkey that chased it, which means each donkey had a specific monkey to chase, but it does not imply that every donkey chased every monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n- This statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information. The information does not provide enough details about whether there is a single donkey that chased all monkeys or if multiple donkeys chased different monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- This statement must be true. If every donkey chased a monkey that chased it, then it is impossible for every donkey to have chased every monkey. Each donkey had a specific monkey to chase, so there couldn't be a single donkey that chased all monkeys.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 2: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n\nFinal Answer: 2, 6",

There is at least one of each category: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Hazel or Lewis are happy.\n4. Hazel is hungry.\n5. No donkeys will attack just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since Hazel is hungry, the condition \"No donkeys will attack just in case Hazel isn't hungry\" does not apply because Hazel is hungry. Therefore, no additional restrictions on donkeys' behavior due to Hazel's hunger status are imposed.\n\n### Statements to Evaluate:\n1. **Only donkeys will attack.**\n   - This statement is too strong as it excludes humans and monkeys from attacking. We cannot definitively say that only donkeys will attack without more specific information about their behavior.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys will attack.**\n   - This statement is possible but not necessarily true based on the given information. It could be true, but we cannot conclude it with certainty.\n\n3. **No donkeys will attack.**\n   - This statement is also possible but not necessarily true based on the given information. It could be true, but we cannot conclude it with certainty.\n\n4. **Lewis will attack.**\n   - This statement cannot be determined from the given information. The happiness of Hazel or Lewis has no bearing on the behavior of donkeys, humans, or monkeys.\n\n5. **A donkey will attack.**\n   - This statement is possible but not necessarily true based on the given information. Donkeys might attack, but we cannot conclude it with certainty.\n\n6. **Every donkey will attack.**\n   - This statement is too strong and cannot be concluded from the given information. We have no information suggesting that every single donkey will attack.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided statements must be true based solely on the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the above statements must be true.**",

If Alfred will run, then every monkey is asleep only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every donkey will run.\n- From point 4, we know that only donkeys will run. Therefore, every donkey will indeed run. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey will run.\n- Since only donkeys will run (point 4), it follows that at least one donkey will run. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all donkeys will run.\n- This contradicts the fact that only donkeys will run (point 4). Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys will run.\n- This directly contradicts point 4 which states that only donkeys will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred will run.\n- From point 3, Alfred or Hazel will run. However, from point 4, only donkeys will run. Therefore, Alfred cannot be a donkey, and since he can't be a human (as humans won't run), Alfred must be a monkey. But from point 5, every monkey saw Hazel, and since Hazel will run (point 3), every monkey will see Hazel. Thus, Alfred must be a monkey, and since only donkeys will run, Alfred cannot run. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel will run.\n- From point 3, Alfred or Hazel will run. Since Alfred cannot run (point 5), Hazel must run. However, from point 4, only donkeys will run, and Hazel is not a donkey. Therefore, Hazel cannot run. This creates a contradiction. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1. Every donkey will run.\n2.

Every human is happy.\n5. It is not the case that Lewis didn't chase Hazel.\n6. Hazel isn't a human just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased Hazel.\n- From point 5, \"It is not the case that Lewis didn't chase Hazel,\" which means Lewis did chase Hazel.\n- Since Lewis is a donkey, he could have chased Hazel.\n- However, we do not have enough information to conclude that **every** donkey chased Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel chased every donkey.\n- We know Hazel isn't a human (point 6). \n- If Hazel were to chase every donkey, she would need to be a monkey because humans can't chase donkeys (since every human is happy and chasing a donkey would make them unhappy).\n- But Hazel isn't a human, so she could be a monkey. However, we don't have enough information to confirm that Hazel is a monkey or that she chases every donkey. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all donkeys chased Hazel.\n- We know Lewis chased Hazel, and Lewis is a donkey.\n- However, we don't have information about whether other donkeys chased Hazel or not.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively say that not all donkeys chased Hazel. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased Hazel.\n- Similar to Statement 3, we only know that Lewis chased Hazel, and Lewis is a donkey.\n- Without knowing if other donkeys chased Hazel, we cannot conclude that every donkey chased Hazel. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Hazel chased a donkey.\n- Hazel isn't a human (point 6), so she could be a monkey or a donkey.\n- Since Lewis is a donkey and Lewis chased Hazel (point 5), Hazel could have chased Lewis, who is a donkey.\n- Therefore, Hazel chased a donkey. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased Hazel.\n- We know Lewis chased Hazel, and Lewis is a donkey.\n- Therefore, no donkeys chased Hazel. This statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n5. Hazel chased a donkey.\n6.

A human kicked a donkey that kicked a human.\n4. A human chased Lewis only if not all humans chased Lewis.\n5.

This implies a chain of causality involving humans and donkeys.\n- Point 4 tells us that for a human to chase Lewis, it must be the case that not all humans chased Lewis.

However, this does not directly impact the chasing behavior of humans.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **A human chased Lewis.**\n   - This could be true based on point 4, but it doesn't have to be true.

Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true or false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every human is asleep.\n- Since no humans are asleep (from point 3), this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all humans are asleep.\n- Since no humans are asleep (from point 3), this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all humans are asleep if and only if a human is asleep.\n- If no humans are asleep, then \"not all humans are asleep\" is true. Also, since no humans are asleep, \"a human is asleep\" is false. Thus, the statement \"not all humans are asleep if and only if a human is asleep\" is false because the condition \"if\" part is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A human is asleep.\n- From the given information, no humans are asleep. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: Not all humans are asleep.**",

A human saw every monkey.\n5. If every human is asleep, then Alfred will run only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human saw a monkey.\n- We know that a human saw every monkey. This means that for every monkey, there is at least one human who saw it. However, this does not necessarily mean that every human saw a specific monkey. It could be that some humans saw more than one monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"A human saw a monkey\" must be true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a human that every monkey saw.\n- Since a human saw every monkey, it implies that there exists at least one human who saw all the monkeys. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans saw a monkey.\n- This contradicts the fact that a human saw every monkey. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human saw every monkey.\n- The information states that a human saw every monkey, which means there is at least one human who saw all the monkeys. However, it does not specify that every single human saw every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every human saw a monkey.\n- Similar to Statement 4, the information only tells us that a human saw every monkey, not that every human saw a monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No humans saw every monkey.\n- This contradicts the fact that a human saw every monkey. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 2: There is a human that every monkey saw.**",

No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis.\n5. A human will attack and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: No humans chased Lewis.\n- From point 3, no donkeys chased Lewis. Since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and no donkeys chased Lewis, it does not necessarily mean that no humans chased Lewis. Humans could have chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Not all humans chased Lewis.\n- This statement is consistent with the given information. It doesn't contradict any of the provided facts. If all humans chased Lewis, then according to point 4, no humans would be asleep, which contradicts point 5 (a human will attack and only donkeys are asleep). Thus, not all humans chasing Lewis is possible without contradiction.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every human chased Lewis.\n- Similar to statement 1, this is not necessarily true. The fact that no donkeys chased Lewis does not imply that every human chased Lewis. Humans could have chosen not to chase Lewis, or some might have chased him while others did not. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis chased a human.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. We know no donkeys chased Lewis, but we do not have enough information to conclude that Lewis chased a human. He could have chased a donkey or a monkey, or he could have not chased anyone. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human chased Lewis.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. As explained above, we cannot definitively say that a human chased Lewis based on the given information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis chased every human.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. Similar to statement 4, we do not have enough information to conclude that Lewis chased every human. He could have chased some humans and not others, or he could have not chased any humans. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the given statements must be true based on the provided information. \n\nThus, the correct answer is that none of the statements must be true.",

Every human kicked every donkey.\n4. A human saw a monkey that saw a donkey.\n5. Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n6. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n7. A human saw Lewis and a monkey is hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked a human.\n- From point 3, we know that every human kicked every donkey. This means no donkey was kicked by a human. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- Since every human kicked every donkey (point 3), it implies that no donkey kicked every human. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- As mentioned earlier, every human kicked every donkey, not the other way around. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey kicked every human.\n- Similar to statement 3, since every human kicked every donkey, no donkey kicked every human. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- Again, from point 3, every human kicked every donkey, so no donkey kicked a human. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: There is a donkey that every human kicked.\n- From point 3, every human kicked every donkey, meaning every donkey was kicked by every human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- Statement 2: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- Statement 6: There is a donkey that every human kicked.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n2, 6",

However, we cannot definitively conclude that no humans kicked Hazel based on the given information alone. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n2. **Every human kicked Hazel.**\n   - This statement is too strong. It would mean that every single human in the scenario kicked Hazel. While it's possible that some humans might have kicked Hazel, we cannot conclude that every human did so. Thus, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n3. **A human kicked Hazel.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, we cannot definitively conclude that a human kicked Hazel. The information provided does not give us enough details about the actions of humans towards Hazel. Hence, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n4. **Hazel kicked a human.**\n   - This statement is also not necessarily true. There is no information suggesting that Hazel engaged in any action towards humans. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n5. **Not all humans kicked Hazel.**\n   - From the given information, we know that every monkey kicked Lewis, and there are at least one monkey. Therefore, the condition \"not all humans kicked Hazel\" logically follows because if every monkey kicked Lewis, and there are at least one monkey, then not all humans could have kicked Hazel. This statement must be true.\n\n6. **Hazel kicked every human.**\n   - As discussed earlier, there is no information indicating that Hazel engaged in any action towards humans.

Hazel doesn't see Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n5. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis.\n6. It is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis saw Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n- From the given information, we know Lewis doesn't see Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel saw Hazel and Lewis saw Alfred.\n- We do not have any information about Hazel seeing Hazel. Also, from the given information, Lewis doesn't see Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel doesn't see Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n- We do not have any information about Hazel seeing Hazel. However, since Lewis doesn't see Alfred, it is consistent with the given information. Therefore, this statement could potentially be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis saw Alfred.\n- Similar to Statement 2, we do not have any information about Hazel seeing Hazel. Also, Lewis doesn't see Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis saw Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that Lewis doesn't see Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n- We do not have any information about Hazel seeing Hazel. Also, Lewis doesn't see Alfred. Therefore, this statement could potentially be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, only **Statement 3** can be logically deduced as true under the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n3.

Therefore, Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n\n3. **If Hazel kicked Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This statement introduces a conditional relationship between Hazel kicking herself and the monkeys' behavior. However, since Hazel is seen by everyone (including herself), she cannot kick herself. Thus, this condition does not apply here.\n\n4. **Not all humans will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - This tells us that there is at least one human who won't run, and all donkeys will run.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the above analysis:\n\n1. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and a human will run.**\n   - We know Hazel sees Hazel because Hazel is not a donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Hazel will run.**\n   - Since Hazel sees herself and there is at least one human who will run, Hazel might be a human and thus will run. This statement could be true.\n\n3. **Hazel saw Hazel and a human will run.**\n   - Hazel saw Hazel, which is true. And since there is at least one human who will run, this statement is also true.\n\n4. **Hazel saw Hazel and no humans will run.**\n   - Hazel saw Hazel, which is true.

However, there is no information about Alfred being a donkey, human, or monkey, nor is there any information about Alfred running. Thus, we cannot conclude that Alfred will run.\n3. **Not all donkeys will run**: Since \"every donkey will run,\" it is impossible for not all donkeys to run. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n4. **Alfred and Lewis will run**: We know Lewis will run because \"every donkey will run,\" but we do not have enough information about Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n5. **No donkeys will run**: Since \"every donkey will run,\" this statement must be false.\n6. **Only donkeys will run**: Since there are humans and monkeys in the scenario, and they are not specified to run, this statement must be false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**1.

Not all donkeys will run.\n6. It is not the case that Hazel is a monkey.\n7. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n8. It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred saw a donkey.\n- From point 3, we know that \"Every donkey saw Alfred.\" This means that if there is at least one donkey (point 2), then Alfred saw a donkey. Since there is at least one donkey, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred saw every donkey.\n- The information provided does not specify whether every single donkey saw Alfred. It only states that \"every donkey saw Alfred,\" which could mean some donkeys saw Alfred, but not necessarily all of them. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey saw Alfred.\n- Similar to statement 2, the information only tells us that \"every donkey saw Alfred,\" meaning at least one donkey saw Alfred. However, it does not guarantee that every single donkey saw Alfred. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred will run.\n- From point 4, we have \"Lewis will run or no donkeys are happy.\" We do not have enough information about Lewis or the happiness of the donkeys to determine whether Alfred will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Alfred.\n- The information provided does not specify whether all donkeys saw Alfred. It only states that \"every donkey saw Alfred,\" which means all donkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys saw Alfred.\n- The information provided states that \"every donkey saw Alfred.\" This directly contradicts the statement that \"no donkeys saw Alfred.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**1.

            "raw_response": "To solve this problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (and only these three categories).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Lewis is a human.\n4. Every monkey chased every donkey.\n5. A monkey saw a human that saw a monkey.\n6. A monkey kicked Lewis unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n7. Not all humans kicked Alfred just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- From point 4, we know that every monkey chased every donkey. This means that for any donkey, there is at least one monkey that chased it. However, this does not necessarily mean that a specific donkey was chased by a specific monkey. Therefore, this statement could be true, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- Similar to Statement 1, from point 4, every monkey was chased by at least one donkey. But this doesn't imply that every donkey chased every monkey. So, this statement cannot be guaranteed as true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- Again, from point 4, every monkey chased every donkey. This implies that every donkey was chased by at least one monkey. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A monkey chased every donkey.\n- As mentioned in point 4, every monkey chased every donkey. This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- This contradicts point 4 which states that every monkey chased every donkey. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- Since every monkey was chased by at least one donkey (point 4), it follows that no donkey could have chased every monkey. This statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- Statement 3: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- Statement 4: A monkey chased every donkey.\n- Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n\nFinal Answer: 3, 4, 6",

However, Hazel did see Alfred (from point 4).\n- Therefore, this statement is false because it contradicts the fact that Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n**Statement 2: Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel.**\n- We know from point 3 that every monkey ate. The condition \"just in case\" does not apply here since the fact that every monkey ate is a universal truth.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 3: If a monkey saw Alfred, then Hazel ate.**\n- We know from point 3 that every monkey ate. Since Hazel ate, and seeing Alfred does not affect eating behavior, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey saw Alfred only if Hazel ate.**\n- We know from point 3 that every monkey saw Hazel (since Hazel ate). However, seeing Alfred does not depend on Hazel eating.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 5: Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred.**\n- From point 3, we know every monkey ate. From point 4, we know Hazel saw Alfred.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a monkey ate.**\n- We know from point 3 that every monkey ate.

It could be true, but it's not necessarily true based on the given information.

Point 3 only tells us that every monkey kicked Lewis, not that Lewis kicked every monkey. This statement is **not necessarily true**.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred is asleep.\n- We need to consider the implications of the other statements to determine if Alfred is asleep. \n  - If no humans are asleep, then according to point 6, Hazel didn't chase Lewis. However, point 5 does not provide enough information to conclude that no humans are asleep.\n  - If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (and no other).\n2. There is at least one of each: a donkey, a human, and a monkey.\n3. Every monkey saw both Alfred and Lewis.\n4. Every human is asleep if and only if not all humans saw Hazel.\n5. Alfred isn't asleep but it is not the case that Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n- From point 5, we know Alfred isn't asleep.\n- From point 3, every monkey saw both Alfred and Lewis. Since Alfred isn't asleep, he cannot be a monkey. Therefore, Lewis must have seen Hazel because if Lewis didn't see Hazel, then Alfred would have to be a monkey, which contradicts point 5.\n- Thus, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred is asleep.\n- From point 5, Alfred isn't asleep.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred isn't asleep but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n- From point 5, Alfred isn't asleep.\n- From point 3, every monkey saw both Alfred and Lewis. Since Alfred isn't asleep, he cannot be a monkey. Therefore, Lewis must have seen Hazel.\n- Thus, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Hazel are asleep.\n- From point 5, Alfred isn't asleep.\n- From point 4, every human is asleep if and only if not all humans saw Hazel. Since Alfred isn't asleep, not all humans saw Hazel. This means at least one human is awake.\n- Since Hazel could be a human, and we don't have enough information to determine whether Hazel is asleep or not, we can't conclude that Alfred and Hazel are asleep.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n- From point 5, Alfred isn't asleep.\n- From point 3, every monkey saw both Alfred and Lewis. Since Alfred isn't asleep, he cannot be a monkey. Therefore, Lewis must have seen Hazel.\n- Since Alfred isn't asleep, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis is asleep.\n- From point 3, every monkey saw both Alfred and Lewis. Since Alfred isn't asleep, he cannot be a monkey.

Thus, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey chased every human.\n- Similar to Statement 2, this statement is also too strong. It suggests that every single donkey chased every single human, which we do not have evidence for. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys chased every human.\n- This statement is consistent with the given information that no donkeys chased humans. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a donkey that every human chased.\n- The given information does not provide any specific details about whether any particular donkey chased all humans.

There are no other possibilities.\n2. **There's at least one of each**: This means there is at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. **Alfred isn't asleep**: This tells us that Alfred does not fall into the category of being asleep.\n4. **Alfred is a human**: This tells us that Alfred belongs to the category of humans.\n5. **Hazel isn't asleep**: This tells us that Hazel does not fall into the category of being asleep.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce the following:\n- Since Alfred is a human and Alfred isn't asleep, it follows that no humans are asleep. If Alfred were asleep, he would contradict the statement that Alfred isn't asleep.\n- Hazel, being a human, also cannot be asleep because Alfred isn't asleep.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No humans are asleep**: From our deduction, since Alfred (a human) isn't asleep, it logically follows that no humans are asleep.

If Alfred is asleep, then every monkey saw Lewis.\n6. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n7. Hazel isn't asleep and Hazel is a monkey.\n8. Hazel isn't happy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred isn't asleep.\n- From point 7, we know that Hazel is a monkey and Hazel isn't asleep.\n- From point 6, if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n- Since Hazel is a monkey and Hazel isn't happy (point 8), it implies that not all donkeys saw Hazel (because if they did, Hazel would be happy).\n- Therefore, according to point 6, for every monkey to be hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred, Alfred must have seen Alfred (which is impossible since Alfred can't see himself). Hence, not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n- This means point 6 holds true, and therefore Alfred must be awake (since if Alfred were asleep, every monkey would have to have seen Lewis, which contradicts the fact that not all donkeys saw Hazel).\n\nThus, **Statement 1: Alfred isn't asleep** must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel isn't happy.\n- From point 7, Hazel is a monkey and Hazel isn't happy.\n- This statement directly follows from the given information.\n\nThus, **Statement 2: Hazel isn't happy** must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel is happy.\n- This contradicts the information provided in point 7.\n\nThus, **Statement 3: Hazel is happy** must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n- We already determined that Alfred isn't asleep (Statement 1).\n- The statement about Alfred and Lewis being asleep doesn't provide new information based on the given facts.\n\nThus, **Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis are asleep** must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred and Hazel are asleep.\n- We already determined that Alfred isn't asleep (Statement 1).\n- Hazel isn't asleep (point 7).\n\nThus, **Statement 5: Alfred and Hazel are asleep** must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred is asleep.\n- This contradicts the information that Alfred isn't asleep (Statement 1).\n\nThus, **Statement 6: Alfred is asleep** must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (and only these three categories).\n2. There is at least one of each category: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Lewis is a donkey.\n4. Lewis saw Alfred and a monkey being kicked by Alfred.\n5. Either a human kicked Lewis, or Lewis kicked himself.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No donkeys saw Alfred.\n- We know that Lewis is a donkey and saw Alfred and a monkey being kicked by Alfred. However, we do not have enough information about whether other donkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred saw a donkey.\n- Since Lewis is a donkey and saw Alfred, it is possible that Alfred saw Lewis (a donkey). However, we do not have information about whether Alfred saw any other donkeys. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true or false.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey saw Alfred.\n- We know that Lewis, who is a donkey, saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be true because at least one donkey (Lewis) saw Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred saw every donkey.\n- We know that Lewis saw Alfred and a monkey, but we do not have information about whether Alfred saw any other donkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true or false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey saw Alfred.\n- Similar to Statement 4, we know that Lewis saw Alfred, but we do not have information about whether other donkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true or false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all donkeys saw Alfred.\n- We know that Lewis saw Alfred, but we do not have information about whether other donkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true or false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 3: A donkey saw Alfred.**",

Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Only humans drank.\n- This would mean no donkeys or monkeys drank. However, from point 3, we know that every human drank, and there could be donkeys or monkeys who also drank. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis won't run.\n- According to point 4, \"Every human drank,\" and since Lewis is a human, he drank. Point 4 further states, \"Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey is hungry.\" Since Lewis is a human, he cannot be a donkey. Therefore, Lewis won't run because he is not a human who will run. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis will run.\n- As explained above, Lewis won't run because he is a human and every human drank. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all humans drank.\n- This contradicts point 3, which states that every human drank. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 1: A human drank.**\n**Statement 4: Lewis won't run.**",

Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred isn't asleep based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred is asleep.\n- Similar to Statement 1, the given information does not provide sufficient details to determine whether Alfred is asleep or not.

We cannot infer their sleep status from the provided facts.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis is a monkey.\n- Since everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there is at least one of each, it is possible for Lewis to be a monkey. However, the given information does not definitively state that Lewis is a monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lewis is a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n- Similar to the previous statements, the given information does not provide any direct link between Alfred and Lewis being asleep. We cannot infer their sleep status from the provided facts.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis isn't a monkey.\n- Since Lewis saw Alfred and there is at least one monkey, Lewis could be a human or a monkey. However, the given information does not provide any contradiction if Lewis were a monkey.

However, it does not have to be true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Every monkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - This would mean that every monkey kicked another monkey. Given that no monkeys kicked other monkeys (point 3), this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **There is a monkey that every monkey kicked.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is a single monkey who is the target of kicks from all other monkeys. Given that no monkeys kicked other monkeys (point 3), this statement cannot be true.\n\nAfter analyzing all the statements, none of them must necessarily be true based on the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the statements must be true.",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (and no other).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Every human is happy.\n4. Lewis is happy.\n5. If Alfred ate, then every monkey chased Hazel only if a human chased Hazel.\n6. Hazel did not chase Hazel.\n7. It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- From the given information, we know that every human is happy, so this part is true.\n- However, the second part states \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey,\" which means Lewis must be a donkey. But from the given information, we know Lewis is a human, and humans are happy. Therefore, this statement is false because Lewis cannot be both a human and a donkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- This statement is similar to Statement 1. We already established that every human is happy.\n- However, Lewis being a human contradicts the possibility of him being a donkey. Thus, this statement is also false for the same reason as Statement 1.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred ate.\n- The condition given is that if Alfred ate, then every monkey chased Hazel only if a human chased Hazel. Since Hazel did not chase Hazel, and it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey (meaning Lewis is a human), it does not necessarily mean that Alfred ate. Therefore, this statement could be true or false without additional information.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.\n- This statement is logically equivalent to saying \"Every human is asleep\" because if not all humans are asleep, then at least one human must be asleep. Hence, this statement is always false because it implies a contradiction.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred and Lewis ate.\n- We have no information about whether Alfred or Lewis ate. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every human is happy and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- We know that every human is happy, and Lewis is a human, so this part is true.\n- We also know from the given information that Lewis is not a donkey, so this part is also true.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**Statement 6: Every human is happy and Lewis isn't a donkey.**",

No monkeys kicked a monkey.\n4. Every monkey kicked Lewis, and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n5. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis is a monkey.\n- From point 4, we know that every monkey kicked Lewis. Since Lewis isn't a donkey, he could be a monkey.\n- However, we need more specific information about Lewis being a monkey. The given information doesn't directly confirm Lewis as a monkey; it only states that he was kicked by a monkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis is a donkey.\n- This contradicts point 4 which states that every monkey kicked Lewis, and Lewis isn't a donkey. Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis isn't a monkey.\n- This aligns with point 4, which states that every monkey kicked Lewis, and Lewis isn't a donkey. Hence, Lewis must be a human.\n\n#### Statement 4: A human will attack and no humans will attack.\n- This statement is ambiguous and doesn't provide enough context from the given information to determine whether a human will attack or not. We can't conclude anything definitive about this statement based on the provided information.\n\n#### Statement 5: Hazel is a donkey.\n- We don't have any direct information about Hazel's species. The given information does not specify Hazel's species or behavior towards others.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel isn't a donkey.\n- Similar to statement 5, we don't have any direct information about Hazel's species. The given information does not specify Hazel's species or behavior towards others.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true according to the given information is:\n\n**Lewis isn't a monkey.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Statement 3: Lewis isn't a monkey.**",

Not all donkeys drank just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every donkey chased every human.\n- This statement suggests that for every donkey, it chased every human.\n- From the given information, we know that every human chased every donkey. However, this does not imply that every donkey chased every human. It could be possible that some donkeys did not chase any humans.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a donkey that every human chased.\n- This statement suggests that there exists at least one donkey that was chased by every human.\n- Since every human chased every donkey, it means that every human chased every donkey. Thus, there must be at least one donkey that every human chased.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey chased a human.\n- This statement suggests that there is at least one instance where a donkey chased a human.\n- From the given information, every human chased every donkey, which implies that there are instances where donkeys were chased by humans. However, it doesn't guarantee that every donkey chased a human.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys chased every human.\n- This statement suggests that no donkey chased every human.\n- From the given information, every human chased every donkey, meaning that every donkey was chased by every human. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey chased a human.\n- This statement suggests that there is at least one instance where a donkey chased a human.\n- As mentioned earlier, since every human chased every donkey, it follows that there are instances where donkeys were chased by humans. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey chased a human.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey chased a human.\n- While it is true that every human chased every donkey, it does not mean that every donkey chased a human. Some donkeys might have been chased by humans, but not all donkeys necessarily chased a human.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n2.

Not all donkeys kicked every donkey.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No donkeys kicked every donkey.\n- This statement contradicts the fact that \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\" Therefore, it cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.\n- The statement \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" implies that every donkey kicked at least one other donkey. However, it does not necessarily mean that there is a specific donkey that every other donkey kicked. Thus, this statement could be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey kicked a donkey.\n- Since \"Every donkey kicked a donkey,\" this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked every donkey.\n- This would imply that every single donkey kicked every single donkey, which is not necessarily true based on the given information. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys kicked a donkey.\n- This directly contradicts \"Every donkey kicked a donkey.\" Hence, it cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey kicked every donkey.\n- This would mean that there is a specific donkey that kicked every other donkey. While \"Every donkey kicked a donkey\" is true, it doesn't specify a particular donkey that kicked everyone else. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 3: A donkey kicked a donkey.**",

Since not all donkeys chased Alfred, it means that not all humans saw Hazel.\n- From point 5, \"No humans ate, if and only if not all donkeys chased Alfred,\" since not all donkeys chased Alfred, it follows that humans ate.\n- From point 4, \"A human saw Alfred just in case every human chased Hazel,\" if every human chased Hazel, then a human saw Alfred.

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Every human ate.**\n   - This would imply that all humans ate, which contradicts point 5 because it states that humans ate only if not all donkeys chased Alfred. Since not all donkeys chased Alfred, it doesn't necessarily mean every human ate.\n\n4. **Only humans ate.**\n   - This would imply that no other animals ate, which contradicts the fact that there are donkeys and monkeys.

No donkeys kicked every human.\n4. Lewis kicked every human.\n5. Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n6. No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- If Lewis were a donkey, then according to point 4, he would have kicked every human. However, we know from point 3 that no donkeys kicked every human. Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Lewis drank.\n- We need to determine if Alfred and Lewis both drank. According to point 5, only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis. Since Lewis kicked every human (point 4) and no donkeys kicked every human (point 3), Lewis himself cannot be a donkey. Thus, the only way for point 5 to hold true is if no donkeys drank. Since Lewis is not a donkey, he could potentially drink. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that Alfred drank. This statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis is a donkey.\n- As established above, Lewis cannot be a donkey because if he were, he would have to kick every human, which contradicts point 3. This statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred drank.\n- We know that no donkeys drank (from point 5). Since Lewis is not a donkey (point 1), Alfred could be a donkey and still not drink. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that Alfred drank. This statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis drank.\n- We know that no donkeys drank (from point 5). Since Lewis is not a donkey (point 1), he could potentially drink. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that Lewis drank. This statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred didn't drink.\n- We know that no donkeys drank (from point 5).

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Every human saw every human that saw it.\n4. Alfred saw every donkey.\n5. Not all monkeys will run.\n6. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n7. Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n8. It is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n9. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every donkey saw Alfred.\n- From the information, we know that Alfred saw every donkey. However, this does not imply that every donkey saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred will run.\n- The given information does not provide any details about Alfred running or not. Thus, we cannot conclude whether Alfred will run or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred saw a donkey.\n- Since Alfred saw every donkey, it is true that Alfred saw at least one donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey saw Alfred.\n- We know Alfred saw every donkey, so every donkey saw Alfred. Hence, it is true that a donkey saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys saw Alfred.\n- This contradicts the fact that Alfred saw every donkey. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all donkeys saw Alfred.\n- Since Alfred saw every donkey, it means all donkeys saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- Statement 3: Alfred saw a donkey.\n- Statement 4: A donkey saw Alfred.\n\nFinal Answer: 3, 4",

If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n8. Alfred isn't hungry.\n9. Lewis isn't happy.\n10. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n11. Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred is a monkey.\n- From point 10, we know that every monkey chased Alfred. However, Alfred didn't chase Alfred (point 4). This implies that Alfred cannot be a monkey because monkeys chase others, including themselves, which contradicts the condition that Alfred didn't chase himself. Therefore, Alfred cannot be a monkey. So, statement 1 must be false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred isn't asleep.\n- We know from point 5 that not all humans are asleep. Since Alfred is a human (from point 1), it means Alfred could be asleep or awake. However, we have no direct information about whether Alfred is asleep or not. Thus, we cannot definitively say Alfred isn't asleep. So, statement 2 may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred isn't a monkey.\n- As established above, Alfred can't be a monkey because every monkey chased Alfred, and Alfred didn't chase himself. Therefore, statement 3 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred is asleep.\n- Similar to statement 2, we have no direct information about whether Alfred is asleep or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say Alfred is asleep. So, statement 4 may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred and Lewis are asleep.\n- Again, we have no direct information about whether Alfred and/or Lewis are asleep or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say Alfred and Lewis are asleep together. So, statement 5 may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel are asleep.\n- Similarly, we have no direct information about whether Alfred and Hazel are asleep or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say Alfred and Hazel are asleep together. So, statement 6 may or may not be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is statement 3: \"Alfred isn't a monkey.\"\n\nFinal Answer: 3",

If Alfred were a human, then all humans would have seen Alfred, which is consistent with the given information. Therefore, Alfred cannot be a human. So, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Alfred is a donkey**:\n   - Since Alfred is seen by all humans and there is at least one human, Alfred could be a donkey. However, Alfred could also be a monkey or a human. We do not have enough information to definitively say Alfred is a donkey. So, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n3. **Lewis is a donkey**:\n   - Lewis is not a donkey (from point 5). Also, since no donkeys saw Lewis (point 4), this doesn't contradict anything. However, we cannot conclude that Lewis is a donkey based on the given information. So, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n4. **Alfred isn't a donkey**:\n   - Alfred is seen by all humans, and there is at least one human. If Alfred were a donkey, then all humans would have seen a donkey, which contradicts the information that no humans saw a human that saw it. Therefore, Alfred cannot be a donkey. So, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **Alfred is a human**:\n   - As discussed earlier, Alfred cannot be a human because Alfred is seen by all humans, and if Alfred were a human, all humans would have seen Alfred, which is consistent with the given information. So, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- Alfred isn't a human.\n- Alfred isn't a donkey.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n\n1. Alfred isn't a human.\n4. Alfred isn't a donkey.",

A donkey kicked a monkey that kicked a donkey.\n4. Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n5. Every donkey drank.\n6. If Lewis is a donkey, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 5, we know that every donkey drank. Therefore, if there are any donkeys, they must have drunk.\n- From point 3, we know that a donkey kicked a monkey that kicked a donkey. This implies that there must be at least one donkey, one monkey, and one human involved in these actions.\n- From point 4, Lewis did not kick Alfred.\n- Point 6 introduces a conditional statement about Hazel kicking Alfred based on whether every monkey kicked Lewis. However, this doesn't directly affect our current analysis since we need to determine what must be true based on the other given facts.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Only donkeys drank.**\n   - This would mean no humans or monkeys drank. However, we know that every donkey drank, so this statement cannot be true because it excludes humans and monkeys from drinking.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - We know that every donkey drank, but we do not have enough information to conclude that Alfred or Lewis are donkeys. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n3. **A donkey drank.**\n   - Since every donkey drank, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys drank.**\n   - This contradicts the fact that every donkey drank, so this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Alfred drank.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine if Alfred is a donkey, human, or monkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n6. **No donkeys drank.**\n   - This contradicts the fact that every donkey drank, so this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3.

No humans kicked a donkey.\n4. Hazel kicked a donkey.\n5. If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.\n- This statement can be rephrased as \"Hazel is a human only if Hazel isn't a human.\"\n- This is a contradiction because it cannot be both true and false simultaneously. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel is a human.\n- We know Hazel kicked a donkey. Since no humans kicked a donkey, Hazel cannot be a human. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred will attack.\n- The condition given is that if Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n- Let's denote:\n    - \\( A \\): Alfred attacks.\n    - \\( D \\): All donkeys kicked Hazel.\n    - \\( M \\): Every monkey saw Hazel.\n- The condition translates to: \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow (\\neg D \\leftrightarrow M) \\).\n- This means if Alfred won't attack, then either all donkeys did not kick Hazel or every monkey saw Hazel.\n- Since Hazel kicked a donkey, not all donkeys kicked Hazel (\\( \\neg D \\)).\n- For the implication to hold, \\( M \\) must be true (every monkey saw Hazel).\n- However, we do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred will attack or not based on this condition alone. Thus, we cannot conclude Alfred will attack. This statement could be true or false without additional information.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Hazel will attack.\n- Similar to Statement 3, we need more specific information about Alfred's behavior. Without knowing whether Alfred will attack or not, we cannot definitively say Alfred and Hazel will attack. This statement could be true or false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Hazel isn't a human.\n- As previously determined, Hazel kicked a donkey, so Hazel cannot be a human. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.\n- This statement is a contradiction because it cannot be both true and false simultaneously.

            "raw_response": "To solve this problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each type.\n3. Every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.\n4. A monkey chased a monkey that chased a monkey.\n5. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every monkey was kicked by a donkey. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that every monkey was kicked by a donkey. The only information we have about donkeys kicking monkeys is that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it. This does not imply that every monkey was kicked by a donkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every donkey kicked a monkey.\n- We know that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it. This means that for every monkey, there exists a donkey that kicked it. However, this does not necessarily mean that every donkey kicked a monkey. It could be possible that some donkeys did not kick any monkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that no donkey kicked all the monkeys. Given that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, it implies that each monkey had a specific donkey that kicked it. Thus, it is impossible for a single donkey to kick all the monkeys because each monkey has its own specific donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey kicked every monkey. However, from the given information, we only know that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, which does not imply that every donkey kicked every monkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey kicked a monkey.\n- From the information that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, it follows that at least one donkey kicked at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that no donkey kicked a monkey. However, from the given information, we know that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, which implies that at least one donkey kicked at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- Statement 3: No donkeys kicked every monkey.\n- Statement 5: A donkey kicked a monkey.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n- **Statement 3 and Statement 5** must be true.",

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey chased Hazel.\n- Since Hazel chased every donkey, it is certain that at least one donkey (specifically Hazel) chased Hazel.

This statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel is hungry.\n- The condition given is that if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel is hungry. However, we do not have enough information to determine whether Hazel is hungry or not.

However, this doesn't necessarily mean no donkeys were chased at all. It could be that some donkeys were chased by other animals (humans or monkeys) or even by themselves indirectly.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a donkey that every donkey chased.\n- This statement implies that there exists a donkey that is being chased by every other donkey.\n- Since no donkeys chased donkeys directly, this scenario seems impossible under the given conditions.\n- Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey chased a donkey.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that no donkeys chased donkeys.\n- Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased every donkey.\n- Similar to Statement 1, this would imply that every donkey was chased by every other donkey.\n- Again, from the given information, no donkeys chased donkeys directly, making this statement impossible.\n- Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey chased a donkey that chased it.\n- This statement is about a specific relationship between a donkey chasing another donkey that has already been chased.\n- The given information does not provide enough details to determine if such a relationship exists.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey chased a donkey.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey was chased by at least one donkey.\n- Since no donkeys chased donkeys directly, every donkey must have been chased by a human or a monkey.\n- Given that there is at least one human and at least one monkey, and considering the constraints, it is possible for every donkey to be chased by these other animals.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: Every donkey chased a donkey.**",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. There is a human that every donkey kicked.\n4. Every human chased every donkey that chased every donkey.\n5. No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.\n6. Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n7. No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a monkey ate.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- This statement is too strong. It implies that every single donkey kicked every single human, which isn't necessarily true based on the given information. We know there is at least one human that every donkey kicked, but we don't have enough information to conclude that every donkey kicked every human.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey kicked every human.\n- Similar to Statement 1, this is also too strong. It suggests that every single donkey kicked every single human, which isn't supported by the given information. We know there is at least one human that every donkey kicked, but we don't have enough information to conclude that every donkey kicked every human.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- This statement is weaker than Statement 1 and 2. It suggests that every donkey kicked at least one human. Given that there is at least one human that every donkey kicked, it is possible that every donkey kicked a human. However, it doesn't rule out the possibility that some donkeys didn't kick any humans. Therefore, this statement could be true, but we can't definitively say it must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.\n- This statement is logically inconsistent. If \"every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep,\" then it would mean that if not all humans are asleep, then every human is asleep. This creates a paradox because if not all humans are asleep, then it cannot be true that every human is asleep. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- This statement is false. Since there is at least one human that every donkey kicked, it means that no donkey could possibly not kick that specific human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked a human.\n- This statement is false. Given that there is at least one human that every donkey kicked, it means that at least one donkey did kick a human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter analyzing each statement, we find that none of the provided statements must be true based on the given information. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\nNone of the statements must be true.",

No donkeys kicked a human.\n4. A donkey kicked every monkey.\n5. If every monkey saw Lewis, then every monkey is hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every human.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The information provided does not specify whether donkeys kicked humans or not. It only states that donkeys kicked every monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that every human was kicked by a donkey.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- This statement is also not necessarily true. Similar to Statement 1, the information does not provide details about donkeys kicking humans. We only know that donkeys kicked monkeys.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey kicked a human.\n- This statement could be true. Since there is at least one donkey and at least one human, and donkeys kicked every monkey, it is possible that a donkey kicked a human. However, we cannot definitively say this based on the given information alone.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- This statement is false. As explained for Statement 3, we do not have enough information to conclude that every donkey kicked a human.\n\n#### Statement 5: A human will attack and no humans will attack.\n- This statement is ambiguous and lacks context. Without additional information about what constitutes an attack, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false.\n\n#### Statement 6: There is not a human that every donkey kicked.\n- This statement is true. From the given information, we know that donkeys kicked every monkey, but there is no indication that every donkey kicked every human. Thus, there is at least one human that no donkey kicked.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is **Statement 6**.\n\nFinal Answer: Statement 6",

Every donkey saw every other donkey that saw it.\n4. Lewis saw a donkey.\n5. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey saw a donkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every donkey saw every other donkey that saw it. This means that if there is at least one donkey, then there must be at least one instance where a donkey saw another donkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys saw every donkey.\n- This statement contradicts point 3, which states that every donkey saw every other donkey that saw it. Since there is at least one donkey, it must have seen every other donkey that saw it. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey saw every donkey.\n- While it is possible for a donkey to see every other donkey, it does not necessarily mean that every single donkey saw every other donkey. It only means that the specific donkey in question saw all the other donkeys. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey saw a donkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true because it doesn't specify which donkeys saw which others. It could be that some donkeys did not see any other donkeys. Therefore, this statement cannot be guaranteed as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey saw every donkey.\n- Similar to statement 3, while it is possible for every donkey to see every other donkey, it is not necessarily true based on the given information. The condition only specifies that every donkey saw every other donkey that saw it, not necessarily every single donkey. Hence, this statement cannot be guaranteed as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey saw every donkey that saw it.\n- This statement aligns with point 3, which states that every donkey saw every other donkey that saw it. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1. A donkey saw a donkey.\n6.

However, we do not have enough information to conclude that every donkey kicked every other donkey. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily follow from the given information.\n\n**Statement 2: No donkeys kicked a donkey.**\n- This contradicts the fact that every donkey kicks a donkey that kicked it.

Again, we lack sufficient information to confirm this. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily follow.\n\n**Statement 4: There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.**\n- This suggests that there is a donkey that acts as a \"kicker\" for all other donkeys. Given the transitive nature of kicking among donkeys, such a donkey could exist. However, we need more specific information about the distribution of kickers and kickees to definitively say this is true.\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey kicked a donkey.**\n- From the given information, we know that every donkey kicks a donkey that kicked it. Since there is at least one donkey, there must be at least one donkey that kicked another donkey. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every donkey.**\n- This directly contradicts the transitive property of kicking among donkeys.

As mentioned earlier, a human is happy if and only if no donkeys will attack. Being asleep is not the only condition for happiness; it depends on no donkeys attacking.

There is a human that every monkey saw.\n4. Every donkey saw Hazel only if a donkey saw Lewis.\n5. A monkey kicked Alfred and no humans will attack.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 5, we know that a monkey kicked Alfred, and since no humans will attack, Alfred cannot be attacked by any human.\n- From point 3, there is a human who saw every monkey. This implies that this human has seen all monkeys, which means this human could potentially see a monkey who kicked Alfred. However, since no humans will attack, this human does not attack Alfred directly.\n- Point 4 states that every donkey saw Hazel only if a donkey saw Lewis. This doesn't provide direct information about attacks, but it indicates a relationship between seeing Hazel and seeing Lewis among donkeys.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Alfred will attack.**\n   - No humans will attack (point 5). Since Alfred is a human, he will not attack.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis will attack.**\n   - Alfred will not attack (point 5).\n   - Lewis is not mentioned in the given information regarding attacks.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **A human will attack.**\n   - No humans will attack (point 5).\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all humans will attack.**\n   - No humans will attack (point 5).\n   - Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Every human will attack.**\n   - No humans will attack (point 5).\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Only humans will attack.**\n   - No humans will attack (point 5).\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n**4.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. No donkeys saw Lewis.\n4. Every human saw Alfred.\n5. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. Lewis saw Lewis if and only if not all humans kicked Alfred.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.\n- This statement is contradictory because \"not all\" implies some monkeys did not kick Lewis, while \"every\" implies all monkeys kicked Lewis. These cannot both be true simultaneously.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey saw Lewis.\n- From the given information, no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis saw every donkey.\n- We know no donkeys saw Lewis, so Lewis could have seen some donkeys, but we do not have enough information to conclude he saw every donkey. Thus, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- This statement is contradictory. If no donkeys saw Lewis, then Lewis cannot be a donkey. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- This statement is consistent with the given information. Since no donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey saw Lewis.\n- Similar to Statement 3, since no donkeys saw Lewis, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**",

Only donkeys are asleep.\n8. It is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since only donkeys are asleep, Hazel cannot be asleep because she saw Lewis.\n- Therefore, Hazel must be a donkey (since she saw Lewis and only donkeys are asleep).\n\nGiven that Hazel is a donkey, we can deduce:\n- Hazel saw Lewis, which means Lewis is a human (since Hazel is a donkey and they interacted).\n- Since Hazel is a donkey and only donkeys are asleep, Hazel is awake.\n- Since Hazel is awake, not all humans are asleep (because if all humans were asleep, Hazel would also be asleep, contradicting the fact that Hazel is awake).\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditional statements:\n- \"If not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\"\n- \"If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\"\n\nSince not all humans are asleep (Hazel is awake), we need to consider the implications:\n- The first statement implies that if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Lewis is hungry.\n- The second statement implies that if not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\n\nLet's evaluate these implications:\n- If no humans are hungry, then Lewis is not hungry (since he wouldn't be hungry if no humans are hungry).\n- If Lewis is not hungry, then not all donkeys saw Hazel (because the first statement requires Lewis to be hungry for not all donkeys to have seen Hazel).\n\nTherefore, since no humans are hungry, Lewis is not hungry, and thus not all donkeys saw Hazel. This means that statement 2 (\"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\") must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n2.

Therefore, Hazel did see Alfred. This statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred saw Hazel.**\n   - We know Hazel is a monkey and every monkey saw Alfred. Therefore, Alfred saw Hazel. This statement is true.\n\n3. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - As established, Alfred saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n   - Both Hazel and Alfred are monkeys, and every monkey will run. Therefore, both will run. This statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - Since Alfred is a monkey, he will run. This statement is true.\n\n6. **Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - We already determined that Hazel saw Alfred. This statement is true.\n\nIn summary, the statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- 2. Alfred saw Hazel.\n- 4. Alfred and Hazel will run.\n- 5. Alfred will run.\n- 6.

It assumes that every single donkey kicked every single human, which is not supported by the given information.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey kicked a human.\n- This statement is less specific than Statement 1. While it is possible that some donkeys kicked some humans, we do not have enough information to conclude that every donkey kicked every human.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- This statement contradicts Statement 1, which states that every donkey kicked every human that kicked it. If every donkey kicked every human, then it would be true that no donkeys did not kick every human.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- This statement is broader than Statement 1. While it is possible that every donkey kicked some humans, we do not have enough information to conclude that every donkey kicked every human.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true according to the given information is:\n\n**Statement 1: A donkey kicked every human that kicked it.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Alfred didn't chase Alfred, which means Alfred can't be chasing himself.\n4. It is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel, meaning Hazel sees Hazel.\n5. Alfred doesn't see Alfred only if Hazel is a human.\n6. A human saw Lewis.\n7. Every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred isn't a monkey.\n- If Alfred were a monkey, then according to point 6, every monkey would have chased Alfred. However, Alfred didn't chase Alfred, so Alfred cannot be a monkey. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis isn't a human.\n- We know that a human saw Lewis (point 6). Therefore, Lewis must be either a donkey or a monkey. Since we already deduced that Alfred isn't a monkey (Statement 1), and there's at least one monkey, Lewis must be a monkey. Thus, Lewis can't be a human. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred isn't a human.\n- From point 5, if Hazel is a human, then Alfred doesn't see Alfred. But Alfred didn't chase Alfred, so Alfred can't be a human. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis is a human.\n- We concluded that Lewis must be a monkey from the previous analysis. Therefore, Lewis can't be a human. This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred is a monkey.\n- We've already determined that Alfred isn't a monkey (Statements 1 and 3). This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred is a human.\n- We've already determined that Alfred isn't a human (Statements 1 and 3). This statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1. Alfred isn't a monkey.\n2. Lewis isn't a human.\n3. Alfred isn't a human.\n\nFinal Answer: 1, 2, 3",

Conversely, if all donkeys will attack, then not every monkey will run.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys will attack or no donkeys are happy**: This implies that if not all donkeys will attack, then no donkeys are happy. Conversely, if all donkeys will attack, then at least some donkeys are happy.\n\n5. **No donkeys are happy unless every donkey will attack**: This means that if no donkeys are happy, then every donkey will attack. Conversely, if at least one donkey is happy, then not all donkeys will attack.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: No donkeys are happy.**\n- From condition 4, if not all donkeys will attack, then no donkeys are happy.\n- From condition 5, if no donkeys are happy, then every donkey will attack.\n- Combining these, we get: If not all donkeys will attack, then every donkey will attack.\n- However, from condition 3, if not all donkeys will attack, then every monkey will run.\n- Since monkeys cannot be happy (as they are not donkeys or humans), this creates a contradiction because it would mean no donkeys are happy, but every monkey will run, which contradicts the fact that monkeys cannot be happy.\n- Therefore, not all donkeys will attack, and hence every donkey will attack, making no donkeys happy impossible.\n- Thus, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n**Statement 2: Every donkey is happy.**\n- From condition 5, if no donkeys are happy, then every donkey will attack.\n- We have already established that no donkeys being happy is impossible.\n- Therefore, every donkey must be happy.\n- Thus, Statement 2 must be true.\n\n**Statement 3: A donkey is happy.**\n- Since we've determined that every donkey is happy (Statement 2), it follows that at least one donkey is happy.\n- Thus, Statement 3 must be true.\n\n**Statement 4: Every donkey will run.**\n- From condition 3, if not all donkeys will attack, then every monkey will run.\n- From condition 5, if no donkeys are happy, then every donkey will attack.\n- Since we've established that no donkeys are happy (Statement 1 is false), every donkey will attack.\n- Therefore, every monkey will run.\n- Thus, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Only donkeys are happy.**\n- We've established that every donkey is happy.\n- Since there are also humans and monkeys, and only donkeys are happy, this statement is not necessarily true.\n- Thus, Statement 5 must be false.\n\n**Statement 6: A human will attack and no humans will attack.**\n- These two statements contradict each other.\n- Given the conditions, we know that every donkey will attack, and since there are humans, they must be included in the category of \"not donkeys.\"\n- Therefore, a human cannot attack.\n- Thus, Statement 6 must be false.\n\nIn conclusion, the statements that must be true are:\n2.

Not all monkeys chased Lewis only if not all humans kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n- Since Hazel kicked every human, and only humans are hungry, Hazel cannot be hungry (because Hazel kicked every human, and Hazel kicking someone implies that person is hungry). Therefore, Hazel is not hungry.\n- The statement \"If Hazel is hungry\" is false because Hazel is not hungry.\n- Hence, the condition \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry\" does not apply here since Hazel is not hungry.\n- Conclusion: This statement is vacuously true because the antecedent is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n- From the given information, only humans are hungry.\n- Neither Lewis nor Alfred is specified as a human, so they could be donkeys or monkeys.\n- Therefore, Alfred and Lewis cannot be hungry.\n- Conclusion: This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: If Hazel kicked Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry.\n- If Hazel kicked Hazel, it would imply Hazel is a human (since only humans can kick others).\n- Since Hazel is a human, the statement \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is false.\n- The condition \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no humans are hungry\" does not apply here because Hazel being a human means the condition is irrelevant.\n- Conclusion: This statement is vacuously true because the antecedent is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred is hungry.\n- As discussed earlier, Alfred is not specified as a human, so he could be a donkey or a monkey.\n- Therefore, Alfred cannot be hungry.\n- Conclusion: This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Only humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- Only humans are hungry, which aligns with the given information.\n- No donkeys kicked Hazel, which also aligns with the given information.\n- Conclusion: This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all humans are hungry and no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- Since only humans are hungry, not all humans are necessarily hungry (it could be that none are hungry).\n- No donkeys kicked Hazel, which aligns with the given information.\n- Conclusion: This statement is false because it includes the possibility that some humans might be hungry.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n1.

Since every human saw Alfred, and humans only see those who attack (because they are awake), it implies that Alfred must have attacked for all humans to see him.\n- However, we do not have enough information about whether Lewis attacked or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred and Lewis will attack.\n- **False**\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred won't attack.\n- Similar to Statement 1, we know that every human sees Alfred, and since humans only see those who attack, Alfred must have attacked.\n- Therefore, Alfred won't attack.\n- **False**\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred will attack.\n- As explained above, since every human sees Alfred and humans only see those who attack, Alfred must have attacked.\n- **True**\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys saw Lewis and every donkey drank.\n- We know from point 4 that no donkeys saw Lewis. This part is consistent with the given information.\n- We also know from point 3 that every donkey drank. This part is also consistent with the given information.\n- **True**\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all donkeys drank.\n- The statement seems redundant because it mentions Lewis seeing Lewis, which is always true. Additionally, the condition about not all donkeys drinking does not affect the fact that Lewis saw Lewis.\n- **False**\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis will attack.\n- We already determined that Alfred must have attacked, and since every human sees Alfred, Alfred being awake means he attacked.\n- Therefore, Lewis will attack.\n- **True**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- Statement 3: Alfred will attack.\n- Statement 4: No donkeys saw Lewis and every donkey drank.\n- Statement 6: Lewis will attack.\n\nFinal Answer: 3, 4, 6",

It cannot be both \"not all\" and \"every\" at the same time. Therefore, it cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis saw every monkey.\n- We know that every monkey saw Alfred, and since Lewis saw Alfred, it follows from the fourth condition that every monkey also saw Lewis. Thus, Lewis saw every monkey. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all monkeys saw Lewis.\n- Since we have established that every monkey saw Lewis, it means that all monkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: No monkeys saw Lewis.\n- This contradicts the fact that every monkey saw Lewis. Hence, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every monkey saw Lewis.\n- As discussed, if every monkey saw Alfred, and Lewis saw Alfred, then every monkey also saw Lewis. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis saw a monkey.\n- Since every monkey saw Lewis, it implies that Lewis saw at least one monkey.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one human, at least one donkey, and at least one monkey.\n3. There is a human that every human chased.\n4. Every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run.\n5. If Hazel is a human, then Alfred isn't a human.\n6. Lewis ate and every donkey will run.\n7. Alfred isn't asleep and Hazel isn't asleep.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred will run.\n- From point 6, \"Lewis ate and every donkey will run.\" Since Lewis ate, every donkey will run.\n- From point 4, \"Every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run.\"\n  - If every donkey runs, then it satisfies the condition \"not all donkeys will run\" because not all donkeys are running (since some might be happy).\n- Therefore, Alfred will run.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys are happy.\n- From point 4, \"Every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run.\"\n  - If no donkeys are happy, then \"not all donkeys will run\" would be false because all donkeys are unhappy.\n  - This contradicts point 4, which states that \"every donkey is happy or not all donkeys will run.\"\n- Therefore, no donkeys can be happy.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey is happy.\n- As analyzed in Statement 2, if every donkey were happy, then \"not all donkeys will run\" would be false, contradicting point 4.\n- Therefore, every donkey cannot be happy.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all donkeys are happy.\n- This aligns with our analysis in Statement 2 and Statement 3.\n- Since we've established that no donkeys are happy, it follows that not all donkeys are happy.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.\n- This is contradictory because if every donkey will run, then it means all donkeys will run, which contradicts \"not all donkeys will run.\"\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Only donkeys are happy.\n- This is not necessarily true based on the given information. We only know that no donkeys are happy, but nothing is said about other animals being happy.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1.

This suggests a symmetric relationship among humans.\n\n3. **A monkey kicked a human that kicked a human.**\n   - This indicates that there is a monkey who performed an action on a human, and that human had previously seen another human.\n\n4. **Alfred isn't asleep and Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - Alfred is awake, and Lewis is classified as a donkey.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A human saw every human that saw it.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. The condition only states that \"every human saw every human that saw it,\" which does not imply that every human saw every other human.\n\n2. **Every human saw every human.**\n   - This statement is also not necessarily true. The condition only specifies that \"every human saw every human that saw it,\" which does not guarantee that every human saw every other human.\n\n3. **A human saw a human.**\n   - This statement is true because there are at least one human and one human. Since every human saw every human that saw it, it follows that at least one human saw another human.\n\n4. **Every human saw a human.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. While it is true that some humans saw other humans, it does not mean that every single human saw a human. It could be possible that some humans did not see any other humans.\n\n5. **A human saw every human.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The condition only guarantees that every human saw every human that saw it, but it does not specify that every human saw every other human.\n\n6. **No humans saw every human.**\n   - This statement is false because the condition \"every human saw every human that saw it\" implies that every human saw at least one other human, so it cannot be true that no humans saw every human.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 3.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, and there's at least one of each.\n2. Lewis ate.\n3. Lewis and Alfred are happy.\n4. If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 1, we know that everything is categorized as one of three types: donkey, human, or monkey.\n- Point 2 tells us that Lewis ate.\n- Point 3 states that both Lewis and Alfred are happy.\n- Point 4 introduces a conditional statement: \"If not all humans are asleep, then a human chased Lewis only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\"\n\nLet's consider the implications of point 4:\n- The statement \"a human chased Lewis only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" implies that if Lewis did not chase Lewis, then a human must have chased him. Conversely, if Lewis did chase Lewis, no human would have chased him.\n\nSince Lewis ate (point 2), he could potentially chase himself or others. However, the condition in point 4 suggests that if Lewis chased himself, no human would have chased him. Therefore, Lewis cannot have chased himself because if he had, a human would have chased him, which contradicts the condition.\n\nThus, Lewis did not chase himself, meaning he did not chase anyone else either. This means that no human chased Lewis.\n\nGiven that Lewis ate and Alfred is happy (points 2 and 3), we need to determine the truth values of the statements provided.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Lewis and Alfred ate.**\n   - We know Lewis ate (point 2). However, we do not have information about Alfred eating. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n   \n2. **Alfred didn't eat.**\n   - We do not have information about Alfred eating or not eating. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n   \n3. **Lewis ate and Lewis isn't happy.**\n   - We know Lewis ate (point 2), but we do not know his happiness status. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n   \n4. **Lewis ate but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy.**\n   - We know Lewis ate (point 2) and we know he is happy (point 3). Therefore, this statement is true.\n   \n5. **Alfred and Lewis ate.**\n   - We know Lewis ate (point 2), but we do not have information about Alfred eating. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n   \n6. **Alfred ate.**\n   - We do not have information about Alfred eating or not eating.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2:** Alfred is hungry.\n- From point 3, we know only humans are hungry, and Alfred is not specified as a human. Thus, Alfred cannot be hungry.\n- This statement is false.\n\n**Statement 3:** Alfred isn't hungry.\n- As explained above, since only humans are hungry and Alfred is not specified as a human, Alfred cannot be hungry.\n- This statement is true.\n\n**Statement 4:** No donkeys kicked Alfred unless no humans are hungry.\n- From point 3, we know that only humans are hungry, and from point 4, we know that not all donkeys kicked Alfred. This implies that even if no humans were hungry, some donkeys could still have kicked Alfred.\n- This statement is false.\n\n**Statement 5:** Only humans are hungry and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n- From point 3, we know only humans are hungry, which matches part of the statement.\n- From point 4, we know not all donkeys kicked Alfred, which also matches part of the statement.\n- This statement is true.\n\n**Statement 6:** Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n- From point 3, we know only humans are hungry, and Alfred is not specified as a human. Thus, Alfred cannot be hungry.\n- This statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n1. No donkeys kicked Alfred or no humans are hungry.\n3. Alfred isn't hungry.\n5. Only humans are hungry and not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n1, 3, 5.",

Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n- From point 4, we know that \"A human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.\"\n- From point 5, we know that \"Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\"\n- Combining these two points, if every human chased Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel, which means a human would be asleep.\n- However, if not every human chased Hazel, then it doesn't necessarily mean that every monkey chased Hazel, so a human might not be asleep.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n- If not all humans are asleep, then not all humans are asleep.\n- According to point 4, a human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- So, if not all humans are asleep, then not all humans chased Hazel.\n- According to point 5, every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- Therefore, if not all humans chased Hazel, then every monkey did not chase Hazel.\n- This implies that if not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n- Thus, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 3: If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\n- If not all humans are asleep, then not all humans are asleep.\n- According to point 4, a human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- So, if not all humans are asleep, then not all humans chased Hazel.\n- According to point 5, every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- Therefore, if not all humans chased Hazel, then every monkey did not chase Hazel.\n- This implies that if not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\n- Thus, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\n- If not all humans are asleep, then not all humans are asleep.\n- According to point 4, a human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- So, if not all humans are asleep, then not all humans chased Hazel.\n- According to point 5, every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- Therefore, if not all humans chased Hazel, then every monkey did not chase Hazel.\n- This implies that if not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\n- Thus, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n- From point 4, a human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- From point 5, every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- Combining these two points, if every human chased Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel, which means every human would be asleep.\n- However, if not every human chased Hazel, then it doesn't necessarily mean that every monkey chased Hazel, so not all humans might be asleep.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n- If every human is asleep, then not all humans are asleep.\n- According to point 4, a human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- So, if every human is asleep, then every human chased Hazel.\n- According to point 5, every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.\n- Therefore, if every human chased Hazel, then every monkey chased Hazel.\n- This implies that if every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n- Thus, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n2. If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n3. If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.\n6. If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are **2, 3, and 6**.",

Therefore, we cannot determine this from the given facts.\n4. **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey**: From the given information, we know that no donkeys saw Lewis, so this part is true. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that Lewis is not a donkey.

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n6. **Every donkey saw Lewis**: Similar to statement 5, we have no information suggesting that every donkey saw Lewis.

A monkey kicked Alfred, and Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n5. If not all donkeys will run, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n6. Hazel is a monkey, and every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- From the given information, we know that every monkey chased every human that chased every monkey. Since Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred, it implies that every human that chased Alfred was also chased by a monkey. However, we do not have enough information about Lewis specifically chasing anyone or being chased by anyone. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lewis will run. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n- The statement \"A monkey kicked Alfred\" is directly given as true from the information provided.\n- The statement \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred\" is not directly contradicted or supported by the given information. It is possible for Alfred to chase himself, so this part of the statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred will run.\n- We know that every monkey chased Alfred. However, we do not have information about whether Alfred chased anyone or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will run. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred won't run.\n- Similar to Statement 3, we do not have information about whether Alfred chased anyone or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred won't run. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A monkey chased Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n- We know that every monkey chased Alfred, which means a monkey did chase Alfred.\n- We also know that a monkey kicked Alfred, which is directly stated in the information. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel will run.\n- We know that Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred. However, we do not have information about whether Alfred chased anyone or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will run.

There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **Not all humans are hungry.**\n   - This tells us that there exists at least one human who is not hungry.\n\n3. **A monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - This indicates that there is at least one monkey who kicked Alfred.\n\n4. **Every monkey saw Alfred and a monkey kicked Alfred.**\n   - This implies that every monkey saw Alfred because if a monkey kicked Alfred, it must have seen Alfred first.\n\n5. **If Lewis is hungry, then every monkey is hungry only if no humans are hungry.**\n   - This statement involves Lewis being hungry and the condition for all monkeys to be hungry based on the hunger status of humans.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: Not all humans are hungry and every monkey saw Alfred.**\n- From point 2, we know that not all humans are hungry.\n- From point 4, we know that every monkey saw Alfred.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred is hungry.**\n- We do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred is hungry or not. The only information about Alfred is that he was kicked by a monkey, which doesn't imply anything about his hunger status.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n**Statement 3: Alfred isn't hungry.**\n- Similar to Statement 2, we do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred is hungry or not.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n- We do not have enough information about Lewis's hunger status.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n**Statement 5: No monkeys saw Alfred just in case no humans are hungry.**\n- This statement is logically equivalent to saying \"No monkeys saw Alfred if and only if no humans are hungry.\"\n- However, from the given information, we know that every monkey saw Alfred, so this statement cannot be true regardless of the hunger status of humans.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 6: If every monkey is hungry, then no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.**\n- This statement is complex and requires careful analysis. Given that every monkey saw Alfred, and Alfred was kicked by a monkey, it implies that Alfred saw the monkey that kicked him.\n- However, the statement \"no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred\" does not necessarily follow from the given information. The condition about hunger and seeing Alfred is not directly linked in such a way.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\nIn conclusion, the only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 1: Not all humans are hungry and every monkey saw Alfred.**",

If Hazel were a human, then the condition that \"every human saw Hazel\" would need to be true for the \"if\" part to hold.

The condition \"every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred\" does not imply that every human saw Hazel. It only states that either every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 4: No humans saw Hazel.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The condition \"every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred\" does not preclude the possibility that some humans might have seen Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 5: Hazel saw every human.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The condition \"every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred\" does not imply that Hazel saw every human. Hazel could be a donkey or a monkey, and the condition only specifies what humans or donkeys did.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all humans saw Hazel.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The condition \"every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred\" does not preclude the possibility that all humans saw Hazel. It only states that either every human saw Hazel or every donkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is **Statement 1**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n1.

However, we do not have enough information to conclude that a donkey specifically kicked a human. It could be that a human kicked a donkey instead.

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n**Statement 4: Every donkey kicked a human.**\n- Again, from the information provided, we know that a human kicked every donkey, so it is impossible for every donkey to have kicked a human. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n**Statement 5: No donkeys kicked every human.**\n- Since a human kicked every donkey, it is impossible for any donkey to have kicked every human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: A human kicked a donkey.**\n- We know that a human kicked every donkey, which means that yes, a human did kick a donkey.

However, we know Hazel is asleep. Therefore, Hazel cannot be a donkey.\n   \n2. **Hazel isn't a human**:\n   - If Hazel were a human, then Hazel would not be asleep (since humans are not asleep). But we know Hazel is asleep. Therefore, Hazel cannot be a human.\n   \n3. **Hazel is a human**:\n   - We have already determined that Hazel cannot be a human because humans are not asleep.\n   \n4. **Hazel isn't a donkey**:\n   - We have already determined that Hazel cannot be a donkey because donkeys are not asleep.\n   \n5. **Hazel isn't asleep**:\n   - Hazel is explicitly stated to be asleep. Therefore, Hazel is asleep, which contradicts the statement \"Hazel isn't asleep.\"\n\nFrom the analysis above, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**4. Hazel isn't a donkey.**\n\nFinal Answer: 4. Hazel isn't a donkey.",

This contradicts point 5, which states every monkey drank.\n- Therefore, Hazel cannot be a human, and since Hazel is not a monkey, she must be a donkey.\n- Since Hazel is a donkey, and no humans are hungry unless only donkeys drank, it doesn't directly affect whether Alfred drank or not.\n- However, since every monkey drank (point 5) and a monkey kicked Alfred unless a monkey was hungry, and since Hazel is a donkey, the condition for Alfred being kicked does not apply here.\n- Thus, Alfred could have drunk or not drunk, but we cannot definitively say he drank based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred and Hazel drank.\n- Similar to Statement 1, we need to check if both Alfred and Hazel could have drunk.\n- If Hazel is a donkey, as deduced from point 5, and no humans are hungry unless only donkeys drank, then Hazel drinking does not contradict any conditions.\n- However, Alfred's drinking status remains uncertain based on the given information.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively say Alfred and Hazel both drank.\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey drank.\n- From point 5, it is explicitly stated that every monkey drank.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No monkeys drank.\n- This contradicts point 5, which states every monkey drank.\n- Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all monkeys drank.\n- This contradicts point 5, which states every monkey drank.\n- Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Only monkeys drank.\n- This contradicts point 5, which states every monkey drank.\n- Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 3: A monkey drank.**",

If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if not all donkeys will run.\n5. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\n6. A human will attack and every monkey chased Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n- We know that Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred. Therefore, Hazel did chase Alfred. This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n- Since every monkey chased Alfred, and Hazel is a monkey, Alfred chased Hazel. This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred chased Hazel.\n- As mentioned above, since Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred, Alfred chased Hazel. This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- The information provided does not give us any direct details about whether Alfred and Lewis will run or not. We cannot conclude from the given statements alone that they will run. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred will run.\n- Similar to the previous point, we do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred will run or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel chased Alfred.\n- We already established that Hazel is a monkey and every monkey chased Alfred. Therefore, Hazel did chase Alfred.

We only know that every monkey saw Alfred, not the reverse. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Alfred saw a monkey.**\n   - Since every monkey saw Alfred, and Alfred was chased by a monkey, Alfred must have seen at least one monkey.

The information only tells us that every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey, but it does not specify that every donkey chased every single human. It could be that some donkeys did not chase certain humans.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased a human**: This statement is also not necessarily true. The information only tells us that every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey, but it does not guarantee that every donkey chased every human. Some donkeys might have not chased specific humans.\n\n3. **No humans chased every donkey**: This statement is true. According to the rule \"No donkeys chased a human that chased it,\" it follows that no human could have chased every donkey because if a human had chased a donkey, then that donkey would not have been chased by that human.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased a human**: This statement is false. The information states that every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey, so it is possible for some donkeys to have chased humans.\n\n5. **No donkeys chased every human**: This statement is true. If every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey, then no donkey could have chased every human because the condition specifies that a donkey only chases those humans that were chased by others.\n\n6. **Every donkey chased every human**: This statement is not necessarily true. While every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey, it does not mean that every donkey chased every human without exception. There could be exceptions based on the chain of chasing.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- 3. No humans chased every donkey.\n- 5. No donkeys chased every human.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n3. No humans chased every donkey.\n5. No donkeys chased every human.",

Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it.\n4. A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\n5. No donkeys chased Alfred only if Alfred isn't a human.\n6. Not all donkeys chased Alfred if and only if Lewis saw Hazel.\n7. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then no humans are hungry only if Alfred saw Alfred.\n\n### Analyzing Each Statement:\n\n#### Statement 1: There is a monkey that every monkey saw.\n- From point 3, \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it,\" we know that for every monkey, there exists another monkey who saw it. This does not necessarily mean there is a specific monkey that every monkey saw. It could be that each monkey sees a different set of monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No monkeys saw every monkey.\n- From point 3, \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it,\" it implies that every monkey saw at least one other monkey. However, it doesn't imply that every monkey saw every single monkey. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every monkey saw every monkey.\n- This would mean that every monkey saw every other monkey. However, from point 3, we only know that every monkey saw a monkey that saw it, which does not guarantee that every monkey saw every other monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A monkey saw a monkey.\n- From point 3, \"Every monkey saw a monkey that saw it,\" it means that every monkey saw at least one other monkey. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A monkey saw a monkey.\n- This is essentially the same as statement 4, so it must also be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No monkeys saw a monkey.\n- This contradicts point 3, which states that every monkey saw a monkey that saw it. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n\n4. A monkey saw a monkey.\n5.

However, it does not provide any direct information about whether Alfred is asleep or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred is asleep.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Alfred.\n- Since no donkeys saw Alfred, it is true that not all donkeys saw Alfred.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred saw every donkey.\n- Again, we have no information about who saw whom, so we cannot conclude that Alfred saw every donkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Alfred.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. A human saw Lewis.\n4. Every human saw every monkey that saw every donkey.\n5. Alfred is happy, and it is not the case that Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4, we know that every human sees every monkey that sees every donkey. This implies a hierarchical relationship where humans see monkeys who see donkeys.\n- Point 5 tells us that Hazel sees Hazel, which means Hazel is a human (since only humans can see other humans).\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n**Statement 1:** \"A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n- We know a human saw Lewis (point 3). However, we do not have enough information about whether Lewis sees Hazel or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"Lewis saw Lewis just in case a human saw Hazel.\"\n- Since a human saw Lewis (point 3), and we know Hazel is a human (point 5), it follows that a human saw Hazel. Thus, Lewis saw Lewis just in case a human saw Hazel. This statement must be true based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 3:** \"A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n- We know a human saw Lewis (point 3). However, we do not have information about whether Hazel saw Hazel or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n**Statement 4:** \"Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.\"\n- We know a human saw Lewis (point 3). However, we do not have information about whether all humans saw Hazel or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n**Statement 5:** \"A human saw Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\"\n- We know a human saw Lewis (point 3). However, we do not have information about whether Lewis sees Hazel or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.\n\n**Statement 6:** \"A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n- We know a human saw Lewis (point 3). However, we do not have information about whether Hazel saw Hazel or not.

No humans will attack, but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No monkeys saw Lewis.\n- From point 4, we know that a donkey saw a monkey that saw it. This implies that there is at least one donkey and at least one monkey who interacted in such a way.\n- However, there is no direct information about whether Lewis was seen by any of these monkeys. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that no monkeys saw Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis saw a monkey.\n- Since Hazel is a monkey and Lewis isn't hungry, it means Lewis did not see Hazel (as per point 5). \n- Point 4 states that a donkey saw a monkey that saw it. This implies that there is at least one donkey and at least one monkey involved in this interaction.\n- Since Lewis isn't hungry and Hazel is a monkey, it is possible that Lewis saw Hazel indirectly through a donkey. Thus, Lewis could have seen a monkey (Hazel) through this interaction.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every monkey saw Lewis.\n- We do not have enough information to conclude that every monkey saw Lewis. The interaction described in point 4 does not imply that every monkey saw Lewis; it only indicates that some monkeys saw a donkey which saw a monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis saw every monkey.\n- Similar to statement 3, we do not have enough information to conclude that Lewis saw every monkey. The interaction described in point 4 does not imply that Lewis saw every monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A monkey saw Lewis.\n- From point 4, we know that a donkey saw a monkey that saw it. This implies that there is at least one donkey and at least one monkey involved in this interaction.\n- Since Hazel is a monkey and Lewis isn't hungry, it means Lewis did not see Hazel directly. However, Lewis could have seen Hazel indirectly through a donkey.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all monkeys saw Lewis.\n- We do not have enough information to conclude that not all monkeys saw Lewis.

However, it doesn't give us direct information about whether a monkey attacks or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: No monkeys chased a monkey that chased it.**\n- If every monkey chased every monkey, then every monkey would chase every other monkey, including itself. Therefore, this statement cannot be true because a monkey would chase itself, which contradicts the statement.\n\n**Statement 2: There is not a monkey that every monkey chased.**\n- Since every monkey chases every other monkey, there is indeed a monkey (specifically, any one monkey) that every other monkey chased. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 3: No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n- If every monkey chased every other monkey, then no monkey could have been left out. Hence, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey chased every monkey.**\n- As explained above, if every monkey chased every other monkey, then every monkey would chase every other monkey. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred will attack.**\n- We know Alfred kicked Lewis, but we do not have any information about Alfred being a monkey, human, or donkey, nor do we have any information about Alfred attacking anyone. Thus, we cannot conclude this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 6: No monkeys chased a monkey.**\n- If every monkey chased every other monkey, then no monkey would be left unchased. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 4: A monkey chased every monkey.**",

However, this does not necessarily imply that Alfred will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel will run.\n- The information states that Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel. Since not all monkeys will run, it doesn't provide enough information to conclude that Hazel will run. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel and Alfred will run.\n- Similar to Statement 1 and 2, the fact that every human saw Alfred does not imply that Alfred will run. And the condition about Hazel kicking Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel does not guarantee that Hazel will run. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all monkeys will run and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- This statement can be broken into two parts:\n  - \"Not all monkeys will run\" is consistent with the information that not all monkeys will run.\n  - \"No donkeys saw Hazel\" is directly stated in the information provided.\n  \nSince both parts of the statement are supported by the given information, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred won't run.\n- We have already established that every human saw Alfred, but this does not imply that Alfred won't run. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel will run.\n- Similar to the previous statements, the fact that every human saw Alfred does not imply that Alfred will run.

Since P implies Q is false (because P is true and Q is false), this statement is **false**.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis chased a monkey.\n- We know from point 3 that every monkey chased Lewis. Since there is at least one monkey, Lewis must have been chased by at least one monkey. Therefore, Lewis chased a monkey.

Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis chased every monkey.\n- Point 3 tells us that every monkey chased Lewis, but it does not imply that Lewis chased every monkey. Lewis could have been chased by some monkeys but not by others. Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n#### Statement 6: A monkey chased Lewis.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey chased Lewis.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: a donkey, a human, and a monkey.\n3. Every monkey kicked Lewis, but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n4. If Alfred saw Alfred, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n5. Hazel saw Alfred and only humans will run.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel saw Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n- From the given information, we know that every monkey kicked Lewis. Since Lewis is not a donkey, he cannot be a monkey. Therefore, Lewis must be a human.\n- Hazel saw Alfred, which aligns with the fact that only humans will run (from statement 4). This part is consistent.\n- Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred will run.\n- The statement \"If Alfred saw Alfred, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" does not provide enough information to determine whether Alfred will run or not. Alfred might see himself and thus satisfy the condition, but we do not have enough details about his actions or the presence of other entities to conclude he will run.\n- Therefore, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel saw Alfred and Lewis is a donkey.\n- We already established that Lewis is a human, not a donkey. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n- Donkeys can be either humans or monkeys. Since Lewis is a human, he is not a donkey. Therefore, not all donkeys saw Hazel is true.\n- However, since Lewis is a human, he did not see Alfred. So, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis saw Alfred.\n- As discussed, Lewis is a human, so he did not see Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false because it includes \"Lewis saw Alfred,\" which is not true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis saw Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- Lewis is a human, so he did not see Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is **Statement 1**.\n\nFinal Answer: **Statement 1**",

Alfred isn't a human unless only donkeys drank.\n6. Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis doesn't see Lewis.\n7. Hazel saw Alfred and every donkey will run.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- From the information, we know that every donkey will run. Since Alfred and Lewis could potentially be donkeys, they might run.\n- However, we need to check if it's guaranteed that both Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- If Alfred is a donkey, he will run because every donkey runs.\n- If Lewis is a donkey, he will run for the same reason.\n- But if Alfred is a human, he won't run. This depends on whether only donkeys drank, which isn't specified.\n- Similarly, if Lewis is a human, he won't run. This also depends on whether only donkeys drank.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Alfred and Lewis will definitely run.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis doesn't see Lewis.\n- The statement \"Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis doesn't see Lewis\" implies that if Lewis sees Lewis, then no donkey can have seen Hazel.\n- Since Hazel saw Alfred, and Alfred is not a human unless only donkeys drank, we need to consider the implications.\n- If Lewis sees Lewis, then no donkey can have seen Hazel, meaning no donkey would have seen Hazel, contradicting the fact that Hazel saw Alfred.\n- Therefore, Lewis cannot see Lewis.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred won't run.\n- Alfred could be a donkey, in which case he will run.\n- Alfred could be a human, in which case he won't run.\n- We do not have enough information to determine if Alfred is a human or a donkey.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Alfred won't run.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Hazel will run.\n- Alfred could be a donkey, in which case he will run.\n- Hazel will run regardless of her status as a donkey, human, or monkey.\n- Therefore, Alfred and Hazel will definitely run.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred will run.\n- As discussed earlier, Alfred could be a donkey, in which case he will run.\n- However, Alfred could also be a human, in which case he won't run.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Alfred will run.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis saw Lewis.\n- The statement \"Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis doesn't see Lewis\" implies that if Lewis sees Lewis, then no donkey can have seen Hazel.\n- Since Hazel saw Alfred, and Alfred is not a human unless only donkeys drank, we need to consider the implications.\n- If Lewis sees Lewis, then no donkey can have seen Hazel, meaning no donkey would have seen Hazel, contradicting the fact that Hazel saw Alfred.\n- Therefore, Lewis cannot see Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred and Hazel will run.**\n\nTherefore, my final answer is **Statement 4**.",

Every human chased a monkey.\n4. Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n5. A human will run (this doesn't provide additional specific information about chasing behavior).\n6. Alfred isn't hungry.\n7. Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No humans chased a monkey.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that \"Every human chased a monkey.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No humans chased every monkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. The fact that every human chased a monkey does not imply that no human chased every monkey. It could be possible for some humans to have chased multiple monkeys. Thus, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A human chased every monkey.\n- This statement is also not necessarily true based on the given information. The fact that every human chased a monkey does not imply that every monkey was chased by a human. Some humans might have chased more than one monkey, and it's possible that some monkeys were not chased by any human. Thus, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: There is a human that every monkey chased.\n- This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. The fact that every human chased a monkey does not imply that there is a single human who chased all the monkeys. Each human might have chased a different set of monkeys. Thus, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every human chased every monkey.\n- This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. The fact that every human chased a monkey does not imply that every human chased every monkey. Some humans might have chased more than one monkey, and it's possible that some monkeys were not chased by any human. Thus, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A human chased a monkey.\n- This statement must be true because the given information states that \"Every human chased a monkey,\" which means that at least one human chased at least one monkey. Since there is at least one human and at least one monkey, and every human chased a monkey, it follows that at least one human did chase a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: A human chased a monkey.**",

However, we cannot definitively conclude this from the given information alone. Hazel could also be a donkey or a human.\n\n**Statement 2: Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.**\n- This statement is logically equivalent to saying \"Hazel is a human if and only if Hazel is not a human.\" This is a contradiction because it states that Hazel being a human is impossible. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 3: Hazel isn't a human.**\n- Given that Hazel saw every monkey and chased a monkey, Hazel could not be a human (since no humans saw a monkey). Thus, Hazel must be either a donkey or a monkey. Since Hazel saw every monkey, Hazel cannot be a donkey (as donkeys do not see monkeys). Therefore, Hazel must be a monkey. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 4: Hazel is a human.**\n- As established, Hazel cannot be a human based on the given conditions. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n**Statement 5: If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.**\n- This statement is logically equivalent to Statement 2, which we have already determined to be false.\n\nIn conclusion, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: Hazel isn't a human.**",

Thus, this statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis will run.\n- Similar to statement 3, the information provided does not give us any direct indication about whether Alfred will run or not.

Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred won't run.\n- The information provided states that Alfred and Lewis will attack. While it doesn't explicitly say Alfred will run, it implies that Alfred will participate in the attack. However, since Lewis won't run, Alfred might still run to fulfill his part of the attack. But without explicit information, we can't definitively say Alfred won't run.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Every monkey kicked every donkey.\n4. Every monkey kicked Lewis.\n5. A monkey kicked Alfred.\n6. If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if no donkeys ate.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every monkey was kicked by a donkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey kicked every donkey. Therefore, every monkey was indeed kicked by a donkey.\n- Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey kicked a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that at least one donkey kicked at least one monkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey was kicked by a donkey. Since there is at least one monkey, there must be at least one donkey that kicked it.\n- Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that not all donkeys kicked every monkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey was kicked by a donkey. This means that every monkey was kicked by at least one donkey, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every monkey.\n- Hence, this statement could be false because it is possible for every donkey to have kicked every monkey.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey kicked every monkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey was kicked by a donkey, but it does not specify that every donkey kicked every monkey.\n- Hence, this statement could be false because it is possible that some donkeys did not kick every monkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey kicked a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey kicked at least one monkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey was kicked by a donkey, which implies that every donkey kicked at least one monkey (since every monkey was kicked by a donkey).\n- Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A monkey kicked every donkey.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey was kicked by a monkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey kicked every donkey, which implies that every donkey was kicked by a monkey.\n- Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1. A donkey kicked every monkey.\n2. A donkey kicked a monkey.\n5. Every donkey kicked a monkey.\n6. A monkey kicked every donkey.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are **1, 2, 5, and 6**.",

Alfred only kicked himself, so it doesn't imply that he kicked every donkey.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n- This statement is true because Alfred only kicked himself, meaning not all donkeys (specifically, not all donkeys except Alfred) kicked him.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every donkey kicked Alfred.\n- This statement is false because Alfred only kicked himself, so not every donkey kicked him.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n2.

In other words, if a donkey sees another donkey, that second donkey cannot have seen the first donkey.\n\n3. **A human is happy and Lewis saw Alfred.**\n   - This tells us that there is at least one human who is happy, and Lewis observed Alfred.\n\n4. **No donkeys will run.**\n   - This directly states that none of the donkeys will run.\n\n5. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - From the above point, we know Lewis is a donkey.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the given information:\n\n1. **Lewis will run.**\n   - Since no donkeys will run, and Lewis is a donkey, this statement must be false.\n\n2. **Alfred won't run.**\n   - Alfred could be a human or a monkey. Since we do not have specific information about Alfred's type, we cannot definitively say Alfred won't run. However, since no donkeys will run, and Alfred is not specified as a donkey, this statement could be true.\n\n3. **Lewis doesn't see Lewis.**\n   - Since Lewis is a donkey and no donkeys will run, Lewis cannot see another donkey that has seen it. Therefore, Lewis does not see another donkey, so he certainly does not see himself. This statement must be true.\n\n4. **Lewis saw Lewis.**\n   - As explained above, Lewis cannot see another donkey that has seen it, and since Lewis is a donkey, he cannot see another donkey. Thus, Lewis did not see another donkey, and therefore, he did not see himself. This statement must be false.\n\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - Alfred could be a human or a monkey, and we do not have enough information to determine whether he will run or not. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - Since no donkeys will run, and both Lewis and Alfred are not specified as donkeys, this statement cannot be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 3.

Every monkey chased every donkey.\n4. A donkey chased a human that chased it.\n5. A monkey kicked Hazel only if no humans are asleep.\n6. If no humans chased Hazel, then Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every monkey was chased by some donkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey chased every donkey. However, this does not imply that every donkey chased every monkey. It only tells us about the direction of chasing from monkeys to donkeys.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that there is at least one monkey that was not chased by all donkeys.\n- Since every monkey chased every donkey (point 3), it means every monkey was chased by all donkeys. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that there exists at least one donkey that chased a monkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey chased every donkey. This implies that every donkey was chased by every monkey, which includes at least one monkey (the human). Hence, there must be at least one donkey that chased a monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey chased every monkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey chased every donkey, but not vice versa. So, not every donkey chased every monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey chased at least one monkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey chased every donkey, meaning every donkey was chased by every monkey. Hence, every donkey must have been chased by at least one monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n- This statement suggests that there is at least one donkey that chased every monkey.\n- From point 3, we know that every monkey chased every donkey, meaning every donkey was chased by every monkey. This implies that every donkey was chased by every monkey, so there is indeed a donkey (every donkey) that chased every monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n3. A donkey chased a monkey.\n5. Every donkey chased a monkey.\n6. There is a donkey that every monkey chased.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n3, 5, 6",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (and no other).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Lewis is a donkey unless Hazel isn't a human.\n4. A monkey is hungry.\n5. It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n6. Alfred isn't hungry.\n7. It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.\n\nFrom these points, we can deduce the following:\n- Since Lewis cannot be a donkey (point 5), Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n- Since a monkey is always hungry (point 4), if Lewis is a monkey, he must be hungry.\n- From point 6, Alfred isn't hungry.\n- From point 7, since it is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry, Lewis must be hungry.\n- Therefore, Lewis must be a monkey because he is hungry and cannot be a donkey.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications for Hazel:\n- From point 3, \"Lewis is a donkey unless Hazel isn't a human,\" and since Lewis is a monkey, this condition does not apply directly. However, it implies that Hazel being a human would make Lewis a donkey, which contradicts Lewis being a monkey. Thus, Hazel must be a human.\n\nLet's summarize what we have:\n- Lewis is a monkey and therefore hungry.\n- Hazel is a human.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - We know Alfred isn't hungry (point 6). This statement is false.\n\n2. **Hazel isn't a human only if Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a tautology and always true. It doesn't provide new information.\n\n3. **Hazel is a human.**\n   - We have already deduced that Hazel is a human. This statement is true.\n\n4. **If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.**\n   - This is a tautology and always true. It doesn't provide new information.\n\n5. **Hazel isn't a human.**\n   - This contradicts our deduction that Hazel is a human. This statement is false.\n\n6. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - Alfred isn't hungry (point 6), so this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: Hazel is a human.**",

Therefore, this statement cannot be true because it contradicts the given condition.\n\n**Statement 2: Every donkey chased every donkey.**\n- This statement is too strong as it implies that every single donkey chases every single donkey, which isn't necessarily implied by the given conditions. We only know that every donkey chases those that chased them, but not necessarily every single donkey.\n\n**Statement 3: A donkey chased a donkey.**\n- Since there are at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey, and given that every donkey chases every donkey that chased it, it follows that at least one donkey must have chased another donkey.\n\n**Statement 4: Every donkey chased a donkey.**\n- Similar to Statement 2, this is an overgeneralization. It assumes that every single donkey has chased another donkey, which isn't necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 5: A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.**\n- This statement aligns with the given condition that \"every donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\" Since this is a fundamental property of the chasing behavior described, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 6: A donkey chased every donkey.**\n- This statement is stronger than necessary. While it is true that every donkey chases those that chased it, it does not imply that every donkey chases every single donkey. There could be multiple donkeys, and each might chase different donkeys.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 5: A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.**",

Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From condition 1, everything is categorized as one of three types: donkey, human, or monkey.\n- Condition 2 ensures that there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Condition 3 states that no donkeys saw Lewis.\n- Condition 4 indicates that Lewis saw Alfred and implies that a human was present (since \"a human will run\").\n- Condition 5 provides a conditional relationship between Alfred not kicking Hazel and Lewis chasing Lewis.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No donkeys saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n- This statement is false because condition 3 explicitly states that no donkeys saw Lewis, but it does not provide information about whether Lewis saw Alfred or not.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis is a donkey or Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n- We know from condition 3 that no donkeys saw Lewis, so Lewis cannot be a donkey. Therefore, this statement simplifies to \"Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\" However, we do not have enough information to determine whether Alfred sees Lewis or not. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis is a donkey unless Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n- Since Lewis cannot be a donkey (from condition 3), this statement is always false regardless of whether Alfred sees Lewis or not.\n\n#### Statement 4: If Alfred doesn't see Alfred, then a donkey saw Lewis.\n- This statement is irrelevant because Alfred cannot see himself, and the presence of a donkey seeing Lewis is already covered by condition 3.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis is a donkey or it is not the case that Alfred doesn't see Lewis.\n- As discussed, Lewis cannot be a donkey, so this statement simplifies to \"it is not the case that Alfred doesn't see Lewis,\" which means Alfred must see Lewis. However, we do not have enough information to confirm whether Alfred sees Lewis or not. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.\n- This statement is true because condition 3 explicitly states that no donkeys saw Lewis, and condition 4 states that Lewis saw Alfred. \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is **Statement 6: No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred**.",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Every monkey kicked Hazel.\n4. Every human chased every donkey that chased every human.\n5. Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n6. Lewis isn't a donkey but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n7. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 5, we know Lewis isn't a donkey, so Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n- From point 6, since Lewis isn't a donkey, Lewis must see Hazel.\n- From point 7, if every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey kicked Lewis. This implies that if every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis would have kicked Hazel (since Hazel didn't chase Hazel).\n\n### Statement Analysis:\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the above analysis:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - We know Lewis sees Hazel from point 6. So, this part is true.\n   - However, we cannot definitively conclude whether \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true or false without more specific information about the behavior of donkeys towards Hazel. Thus, this statement may or may not be true.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - We know Lewis sees Hazel, so this statement is false because it claims no donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - We know Lewis sees Hazel, so this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - We know Lewis isn't a donkey, so this statement is false.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - We know Lewis isn't a donkey, so this statement is true.\n\n6. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - We know Hazel doesn't see Hazel from point 5, and we know Lewis isn't a donkey from point 6. So, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- Statement 6: Hazel doesn't see Hazel and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are **5 and 6**.",

However, we do not have enough information to conclude that Alfred himself will not run. Therefore, this statement could be false.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n   - We know that every human saw Alfred, so Alfred must have seen a human who runs. But we do not have information about Lewis running. Therefore, this statement could be false.\n\n3. **Lewis will run.**\n   - We know that every human saw Alfred, and since humans run, Alfred must have seen a human who runs. However, we do not have information about Lewis running. Therefore, this statement could be false.\n\n4. **A human saw Alfred just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - The statement \"just in case\" suggests a conditional relationship. Given that not all donkeys chased Alfred, it does not necessarily imply that a human saw Alfred. Thus, this statement could be false.\n\n5. **Alfred will run.**\n   - Since every human saw Alfred and humans run, Alfred must have seen a human who runs. Therefore, Alfred will run. This statement must be true.\n\n6. **A human saw Alfred if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred.**\n   - We know that not all donkeys chased Alfred, but we do not have information about whether no donkeys chased Alfred. Therefore, this statement could be false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that must be true is:\n\n**5. Alfred will run.**",

This does not necessarily imply that Hazel kicked a monkey directly; it just says that if Hazel kicked a monkey, then the condition for not all donkeys kicking Alfred holds.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Hazel kicked a monkey based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: A monkey kicked Hazel.\n- As discussed above, a monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n- We do not have enough information to determine whether every donkey saw Hazel.\n- Thus, we cannot definitively conclude that a monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every monkey kicked Hazel.\n- From statement 4, a monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n- We do not have information about whether every donkey saw Hazel.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that every monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred ate.\n- From statement 5, if Alfred ate, then no humans are hungry only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n- We do not have information about whether Alfred ate or whether every monkey kicked Lewis.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Alfred ate.\n\n#### Statement 5: No monkeys kicked Hazel.\n- From statement 4, a monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n- If no monkeys kicked Hazel, it means that Hazel was not kicked by any monkey.\n- However, this does not provide information about whether every donkey saw Hazel or not.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel kicked every monkey.\n- From statement 4, a monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n- From statement 6, if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Hazel kicked Alfred.\n- If Hazel kicked every monkey, it would mean that every monkey kicked Hazel, which contradicts statement 4 unless every donkey saw Hazel.\n- However, we do not have information about whether every donkey saw Hazel.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Hazel kicked every monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided statements must be true based on the given information. \n\nFinal Answer: None of the statements must be true.",

If every human is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No monkeys chased every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that no single monkey chased all other monkeys.\n- From the information provided, we know that every monkey chased another monkey, but it does not specify whether any single monkey chased all others. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a monkey that every monkey chased.\n- This statement implies that there exists a monkey who was chased by every other monkey.\n- Since every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, and there are at least three types of creatures (donkeys, humans, and monkeys), it is possible for one monkey to be the \"chaser\" for all others. However, without more specific details about the relationships between the monkeys, we cannot conclusively say this is true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every monkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement would mean that every monkey chased every other monkey.\n- The information given states that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, but it does not specify that every monkey chased every other monkey. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A monkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement is directly supported by the information that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\n- Since every monkey chased a monkey, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No monkeys chased a monkey.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that every monkey chased a monkey that chased it.\n- Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A monkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement implies that every monkey chased every other monkey.\n- As discussed earlier, while every monkey chased a monkey that chased it, it does not necessarily mean that every monkey chased every other monkey. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey chased a monkey.**",

Every donkey chased every human.\n4. A monkey kicked Hazel or a human kicked Lewis.\n5. A monkey will attack unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n6. Every donkey will attack unless not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n7. If no humans chased Hazel, then not all humans chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: No donkeys chased a human.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that \"Every donkey chased every human.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a donkey that every human chased.\n- The information states that \"Every donkey chased every human,\" which means every donkey chased every human. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.\n- We know that \"A monkey kicked Hazel or a human kicked Lewis.\" This does not provide enough information to determine whether all monkeys kicked Lewis or not. Thus, we cannot conclude this statement as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased a human.\n- This statement is directly contradicted by the given information that \"Every donkey chased every human.\" Since it is stated that every donkey chased every human, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.\n- The information provided does not give us any details about whether donkeys will run or not. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of this statement.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased every human.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that \"Every donkey chased every human.\" Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 2: There is a donkey that every human chased.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Alfred ate.\n4. Lewis saw Lewis if and only if no monkeys saw Lewis.\n5. Lewis saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From condition 4, we know that Lewis saw Lewis implies no monkeys saw Lewis.\n- From condition 5, we know that Lewis saw Lewis implies not all humans saw Hazel.\n\nLet's break down these implications step-by-step:\n\n#### Implication 1: Lewis saw Lewis implies no monkeys saw Lewis.\n- If Lewis saw Lewis, then no monkeys saw Lewis.\n\n#### Implication 2: Lewis saw Lewis implies not all humans saw Hazel.\n- If Lewis saw Lewis, then not all humans saw Hazel.\n\n#### Implications for Hazel:\n- Since there is at least one human (Hazel) and not all humans saw Hazel, it means some humans did see Hazel.\n- Therefore, if Lewis saw Lewis, it means no monkeys saw Lewis, and since some humans saw Hazel, it follows that not all humans saw Hazel.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A human saw Lewis and Hazel is a monkey.**\n   - This statement does not necessarily follow from the given conditions. We know Hazel is a human, but we do not have information about whether a human saw Lewis or not.\n\n2. **No monkeys saw Lewis if and only if a human saw Hazel.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The conditions do not provide a direct link between the number of monkeys seeing Lewis and humans seeing Hazel.\n\n3. **Hazel isn't a human just in case no monkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This statement is false because Hazel is explicitly stated to be a human.\n\n4. **Hazel is a human only if every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This statement is false because Hazel being a human does not depend on every monkey seeing Lewis; it is simply given that Hazel is a human.\n\n5. **If Hazel is a human, then every monkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This statement is false because Hazel being a human does not imply that every monkey saw Lewis. It only means Hazel is a human.\n\n6. **No monkeys saw Lewis just in case not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - This statement is true. If no monkeys saw Lewis, then by condition 5, not all humans saw Hazel. Conversely, if not all humans saw Hazel, then by condition 5, no monkeys saw Lewis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**6.

A human kicked every monkey.\n4. Every monkey kicked another monkey.\n5. Hazel is a monkey and no humans will run.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A human will run.\n- From the information provided, we know that Hazel is a monkey and no humans will run. Since Hazel is a monkey, she cannot be running. Therefore, it is impossible for a human to run. This statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Only humans will run and no humans will run.\n- This statement is contradictory. It cannot be both \"only humans will run\" and \"no humans will run.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Only humans will run and not all humans will run.\n- If only humans will run, then no other category (donkeys or monkeys) can run. However, since Hazel is a monkey and no humans will run, this statement is also false because it contradicts the fact that Hazel is a monkey who cannot run.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all humans will run.\n- This statement is consistent with the information that Hazel is a monkey and no humans will run. Since Hazel is a monkey and no humans will run, it logically follows that not all humans will run. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Only humans will run.\n- As discussed earlier, Hazel is a monkey and no humans will run. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every human will run.\n- This statement is false because Hazel is a monkey and no humans will run.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: Not all humans will run.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. A human kicked every monkey that kicked it.\n4. Only humans are hungry.\n5. No donkeys saw Lewis.\n6. If every donkey saw Hazel, then not all humans kicked Hazel.\n7. If every monkey saw Lewis, then Lewis is hungry only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n8. Alfred isn't hungry.\n9. It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis isn't a human.\n- From point 4, we know that only humans are hungry. Therefore, if Lewis were a human, he would be hungry. However, from point 8, we know that Lewis isn't hungry. Hence, Lewis cannot be a human. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred is hungry.\n- We know from point 8 that Alfred isn't hungry. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis is a human.\n- Since we have already determined that Lewis isn't a human (Statement 1), this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n- Alfred isn't hungry (point 8). Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis and Alfred are hungry.\n- Both Alfred and Lewis aren't hungry (points 8 and 4). Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel are hungry.\n- Alfred isn't hungry (point 8). Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Lewis isn't a human.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is **1**.",

Alfred saw every donkey.\n4. Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n5. It is not the case that Lewis saw Alfred.\n6. No donkeys saw Hazel.\n7. It is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 3, we know Alfred saw every donkey.\n- From point 4, since not all donkeys saw Hazel, there must be at least one donkey who did not see Hazel.\n- From point 5, since no donkeys saw Hazel, all donkeys did not see Hazel.\n- From point 6, since it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel, Lewis must have seen Hazel.\n- From point 7, since it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel, Lewis must have seen Hazel, which contradicts point 5 because no donkeys saw Hazel. This implies that Lewis cannot be a donkey.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys saw Alfred:** This is consistent with point 3, where Alfred saw every donkey, so not all donkeys saw Alfred. This statement could be true.\n2. **Every donkey saw Alfred:** This contradicts point 3, as Alfred only saw every donkey, not necessarily all of them. This statement cannot be true.\n3. **No donkeys saw Alfred:** This contradicts point 3, as Alfred saw every donkey. This statement cannot be true.\n4. **A donkey saw Alfred:** Since Alfred saw every donkey, at least one donkey (specifically, every donkey) saw Alfred. This statement can be true.\n5. **Alfred saw a donkey:** This is true based on point 3, as Alfred saw every donkey. This statement must be true.\n6. **Alfred is a donkey:** This is not necessarily true. Alfred could be a human or a monkey. This statement does not have to be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 4: A donkey saw Alfred.\n- Statement 5: Alfred saw a donkey.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n4.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (and only these three categories).\n2. There is at least one of each category: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Only donkeys are hungry.\n4. Not all humans kicked Lewis.\n5. Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n6. If a donkey kicked Hazel, then Alfred isn't a human.\n7. A monkey kicked Alfred.\n8. It is not the case that Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis is hungry.\n- Since only donkeys are hungry, and we know Lewis is not a donkey (from point 8), Lewis cannot be hungry. This statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred isn't hungry.\n- Since only donkeys are hungry, and Alfred is not a donkey (because he was kicked by a monkey, which can't be a donkey), Alfred cannot be hungry. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred is hungry.\n- As explained above, Alfred cannot be hungry because he is not a donkey. This statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n- From the analysis above, Alfred cannot be hungry, so this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred and Hazel are hungry.\n- From the analysis above, Alfred cannot be hungry, so this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis isn't hungry.\n- From the analysis above, Lewis cannot be a donkey, and since only donkeys are hungry, Lewis cannot be hungry. This statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- Statement 2: Alfred isn't hungry.\n- Statement 6: Lewis isn't hungry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are **Statement 2** and **Statement 6**.",

Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Lewis will attack.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis and Hazel will attack.\n- Similar to statement 1, we need to know if Hazel chased Hazel. Without this information, we cannot determine if both Lewis and Hazel will attack.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel will attack.\n- We need to know if Hazel chased Hazel. If Hazel chased Hazel, then according to statement 8, a human will attack, which means Hazel will attack. But if Hazel did not chase Hazel, we cannot conclude that Hazel will attack based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: Only humans are hungry and no humans will attack.\n- This statement is incorrect because we know that only humans are hungry, but we do not have information about whether any humans will attack. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no humans will attack.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis won't attack.\n- Since Lewis is a human and only humans are hungry, Lewis is hungry.\n- According to statement 8, if Hazel didn't chase Hazel, a human will attack. Without knowing if Hazel chased Hazel, we cannot definitively say that Lewis won't attack.\n\n#### Statement 6: Only humans are hungry and a human will attack.\n- This statement is partially correct since only humans are hungry. However, we do not have information about whether Hazel chased Hazel, so we cannot conclude that a human will attack.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, none of the provided statements can be definitively concluded as true without additional information.

Therefore, \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" is true. However, since Hazel didn't see anyone (specifically, she didn't see Alfred, and we don't have information about her seeing herself), \"Hazel saw Hazel\" is false. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n- As established, no donkeys saw Hazel (point 6). Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Hazel saw every donkey.\n- We don't have any information indicating that Hazel saw every donkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel saw a donkey.\n- We don't have any specific information about Hazel seeing a donkey.

The given information only states that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, which is a subset of \"every monkey chased a monkey.\" It doesn't guarantee that every monkey chased another monkey.\n\n**Statement 2: No monkeys chased every monkey.**\n- This statement is false because the given information states that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, which implies that some monkeys did indeed chase every monkey.\n\n**Statement 3: Every monkey chased every monkey.**\n- This statement is false because it is an overgeneralization. While every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, it does not imply that every monkey chased every single monkey.\n\n**Statement 4: A monkey chased every monkey.**\n- This statement is false for the same reason as Statement 3. Not every monkey chased every other monkey; only those that were chased by others.\n\n**Statement 5: A monkey chased a monkey.**\n- This statement is true. Since there is at least one monkey, and every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, it follows that at least one monkey chased another monkey.\n\n**Statement 6: A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.**\n- This statement is true based on the given information. The problem states that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 5: A monkey chased a monkey.\n- Statement 6: A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\n\nFinal Answer: 5, 6",

The statement \"no humans will attack\" is given, but it does not imply that not all humans will attack.\n   \n2. **Only humans will attack**: This statement is also not necessarily true. We know that no humans will attack, but we cannot conclude that only humans will attack since we do not have information about the actions of donkeys or monkeys.\n\n3. **Alfred will attack**: This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. There is no mention of Alfred attacking or being attacked.\n\n4. **Every human will attack**: Similar to statement 2, this cannot be concluded from the given information. We know that no humans will attack, so it is impossible for every human to attack.\n\n5. **A human will attack**: This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. We know that no humans will attack.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel will attack**: This statement cannot be concluded from the given information.

Every monkey kicked every monkey.\n4. No humans ate, unless all donkeys drank.\n5. Not all donkeys drank if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Lewis drank.\n- From the fifth statement, \"Not all donkeys drank if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis.\"\n- If all donkeys drank, then all humans did not kick Lewis.\n- If not all donkeys drank, then some humans kicked Lewis.\n- Since there's at least one human, it's possible that some humans kicked Lewis, which means Lewis could have drunk.\n- However, we cannot definitively conclude that Lewis drank based on the given information alone.\n\n#### Statement 2: No humans ate if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis.\n- This statement is logically equivalent to the fifth statement.\n- If no humans ate, then not all humans kicked Lewis.\n- If not all humans kicked Lewis, then no humans ate.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis ate.\n- We do not have enough information to determine whether Lewis ate or not. The given conditions do not provide any direct link between Lewis and eating behavior.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis didn't eat.\n- Similar to Statement 3, we do not have enough information to determine whether Lewis ate or not. The given conditions do not provide any direct link between Lewis and eating behavior.\n\n#### Statement 5: Lewis is a donkey.\n- We do not have enough information to determine whether Lewis is a donkey or not. The given conditions do not provide any direct link between Lewis and being a donkey.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis didn't drink.\n- We do not have enough information to determine whether Lewis drank or not.

Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: A donkey saw Hazel.\n- Since a donkey saw a human who saw a monkey, and we know Lewis is a donkey, it is possible that Lewis saw Hazel. However, we need more specific details about Hazel's interactions with donkeys. Without additional information, we cannot conclude this statement as true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey saw Hazel.\n- This would mean that every single donkey in the scenario saw Hazel. However, we only know that at least one donkey (Lewis) saw a human who saw a monkey. There could be other donkeys, and we don't have information about their interactions with Hazel. Thus, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys saw Hazel.\n- Similar to Statement 3, if no donkeys saw Hazel, then Lewis (who is a donkey) did not see Hazel. However, we do not have information about other donkeys' interactions with Hazel. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n- This statement aligns with our current understanding. We know Lewis saw a human who saw a monkey, but we do not have information about other donkeys' interactions with Hazel. Hence, it is plausible that not all donkeys saw Hazel. This statement can be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Hazel saw every donkey.\n- This would mean that Hazel saw all donkeys, including Lewis. However, we do not have information about Hazel's interactions with other donkeys besides Lewis. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. Every human chased every human.\n4. A monkey chased a human that chased a donkey.\n5. If Lewis chased Lewis, then Alfred isn't a human.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: There is not a human that every human chased.\n- From point 3, we know that every human chased every human. This means for any human \\(H\\), \\(H\\) chased all other humans. Therefore, there is no human that every human chased. This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: No humans chased a human.\n- This statement contradicts point 3, which states that every human chased every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans chased a human that chased it.\n- This statement is equivalent to saying that no human chased another human who was chasing them. However, from point 3, every human chased every human, so this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred is a donkey.\n- The statement \"If Lewis chased Lewis, then Alfred isn't a human\" doesn't provide enough information to determine Alfred's type. It only tells us about the relationship between Lewis and Alfred. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: No humans chased every human.\n- As explained in Statement 1, every human chased every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A human chased every human.\n- This statement aligns with point 3, which states that every human chased every human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: A human chased every human.**",

Every human chased every human that chased every monkey.\n4. Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n5. Every human saw Alfred.\n6. No donkeys saw Hazel.\n7. Every human saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- From point 3, \"Every human chased every human that chased every monkey,\" we know that if Alfred chased someone, that person would have been a human who chased a monkey. Since no donkeys saw Hazel (point 6), and no donkeys chased anyone (since they can only see humans), Alfred couldn't have chased a donkey. Therefore, Alfred could not have chased a human who chased a monkey, which means Alfred didn't chase anyone. Hence, Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- Point 6 states that no donkeys saw Hazel. Since Hazel didn't chase Alfred (point 4), and no donkeys saw Hazel (point 6), this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.\n- This statement is logically equivalent to saying \"If not all humans are asleep, then every human is asleep.\" This is a tautology and does not necessarily follow from the given information. It doesn't provide a clear logical necessity based on the provided facts.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- We already established that Alfred didn't chase Alfred (from point 3). So, this part of the statement is false.\n- Point 6 states that no donkeys saw Hazel. Thus, not all donkeys saw Hazel is true. However, since Alfred didn't chase Alfred, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- Hazel didn't chase Alfred (point 4), which is true.\n- Point 6 states that no donkeys saw Hazel, which is also true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n- We already established that Hazel didn't chase Alfred (point 4), so this part of the statement is false.\n- Point 6 states that no donkeys saw Hazel, which is true. Thus, not all donkeys saw Hazel is true. However, since Hazel didn't chase Alfred, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n- We already established that Hazel didn't chase Alfred (point 4), which is true.\n- Point 6 states that no donkeys saw Hazel, which is also true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n1. Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n6. Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n\nThus, the correct answers are **1 and 6**.",

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. **A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, since no donkeys kicked monkeys, it is impossible for a donkey to have kicked every monkey. This statement is also false.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - Again, based on the information that no donkeys kicked monkeys, it is impossible for every donkey to have kicked every monkey. This statement is false.\n\n4. **There is not a monkey that every donkey kicked.**\n   - Since no donkeys kicked monkeys, there is indeed no monkey that every donkey kicked. This statement is true.\n\n5. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This statement is logically equivalent to saying \"All humans are asleep.\" However, the given information does not provide any details about the sleep status of humans. Thus, we cannot determine whether this statement is true or false based on the provided information.\n\n6. **Every donkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - As previously stated, no donkeys kicked monkeys. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: 4. There is not a monkey that every donkey kicked.**",

However, we do not have enough information about whether Hazel was seen by a monkey or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n#### Statement 3: If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n- This statement involves conditional logic. We know that Hazel saw Alfred, but we don't have information about whether Alfred kicked Hazel or not. Thus, we cannot conclude this statement with certainty.\n\n#### Statement 4: A monkey kicked Hazel only if a monkey saw Alfred.\n- We know that a monkey kicked Alfred.

This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Alfred didn't drink**:\n   - We have no specific information about whether Alfred drank or not. The only thing we know is that Alfred is a human and will attack. This statement does not necessarily follow from the given information.\n\n5. **Alfred won't attack**:\n   - This contradicts point 4, which states that a human will attack. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n6. **Every monkey drank and no humans will attack**:\n   - We know that every monkey drank (point 5). However, we do not have any information about whether no humans will attack. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Alfred will attack.**\n\nFinal Answer: 1",

            "raw_response": "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and deduce which statements must be true based on those conditions. Let's break down the information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means there are no other types of beings besides donkeys, humans, and monkeys.\n\n2. **No donkeys chased a monkey.**\n   - This directly states that donkeys and monkeys do not chase each other.\n\n3. **A monkey kicked a monkey that kicked a donkey.**\n   - This implies a chain of monkey-kicking: Monkey A kicked Monkey B, and Monkey B kicked a Donkey.\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked Alfred unless Hazel doesn't see Alfred.**\n   - This condition involves Alfred, Hazel, and donkeys. It suggests that if Hazel sees Alfred, no donkey can kick Alfred.\n\n5. **If every monkey chased Lewis, then a monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This implies that if all monkeys chase Lewis, then at least one monkey must also chase Hazel.\n\n6. **If every monkey saw Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if Alfred didn't kick Hazel.**\n   - This condition involves the visibility of monkeys, donkeys, and the actions of Alfred and Hazel. It suggests a conditional relationship between seeing Lewis, donkeys kicking Alfred, and Alfred kicking Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: A donkey chased a monkey.**\n- From the third condition, we know that a monkey kicked a monkey that kicked a donkey. However, this does not necessarily mean a donkey chased a monkey. The chain could involve different monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 2: There is a donkey that every monkey chased.**\n- Given the conditions, it is possible for some donkeys to chase all monkeys, but it is not guaranteed. We cannot definitively conclude that such a donkey exists based on the provided information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 3: A donkey chased every monkey.**\n- Similar to Statement 2, it is not guaranteed that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: Every donkey chased every monkey.**\n- As with Statements 2 and 3, it is not guaranteed that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: Every donkey chased a monkey.**\n- Again, while it is possible that every donkey chased a monkey, it is not guaranteed. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.**\n- Since no donkeys chased monkeys (from Condition 2), this statement is true because it is impossible for no donkeys to chase every monkey.\n\nThus, the only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.**",

If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every human saw Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis are happy.\n- We know that a human is happy, so Alfred being happy is possible.\n- However, we do not have enough information about Lewis' happiness directly from the given statements. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred and Lewis are both happy.\n\n#### Statement 2: A monkey is happy and every human chased Alfred.\n- Since every monkey chased Alfred, this part of the statement is consistent with the given information.\n- However, we do not have any direct information about whether a monkey is happy. Thus, we cannot conclude that a monkey is happy.\n\n#### Statement 3: Alfred is happy.\n- We know that a human is happy, and Alfred could be a human. Therefore, Alfred being happy is possible, but we cannot definitively say he is happy based on the given information alone.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred and Hazel are happy.\n- We know that a human is happy, and Alfred could be a human. However, we do not have any information about Hazel's happiness or whether Hazel is a human, donkey, or monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred and Hazel are both happy.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred isn't happy.\n- We know that a human is happy, and Alfred could be a human. Therefore, Alfred being unhappy is possible, but we cannot definitively say he isn't happy based on the given information alone.\n\n#### Statement 6: A human is happy and a monkey chased Alfred.\n- We know that a human is happy.\n- We also know that every monkey chased Alfred.

However, since we know there is at least one donkey, it cannot be the case that \"every donkey kicked Lewis\" because then no donkeys would be unhappy. Therefore, no donkeys are happy.\n5. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans kicked Lewis**: This indicates that if not all humans kicked Lewis, then every human is asleep. Since we know that a donkey kicked every human, it follows that all humans were awake when the donkey kicked them.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No donkeys kicked a human**:\n   - From the information that a donkey kicked every human, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked a human**:\n   - Given that a donkey kicked every human, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked every human**:\n   - The information only states that a donkey kicked every human, not necessarily that every donkey kicked every human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A donkey kicked a human**:\n   - This is directly stated in the information provided, so this statement is true.\n\n5. **No donkeys kicked every human**:\n   - This contradicts the fact that a donkey kicked every human, so this statement is false.\n\n6. **There is a donkey that every human kicked**:\n   - While it is true that a donkey kicked every human, it does not imply that there is a single donkey that did so. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- 2. Every donkey kicked a human.\n- 4.

Thus, we cannot conclude that statement 2 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- Similar to statement 2, the given information does not specify whether every donkey chased every monkey. We only know that some donkeys chased some monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude that statement 3 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- Again, the given information does not provide enough details to conclude that every single donkey chased every single monkey. Some donkeys might have chased some monkeys, but not necessarily all donkeys chasing all monkeys. Hence, we cannot conclude that statement 4 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- As with statement 4, the given information does not support the claim that every donkey chased every monkey. Some donkeys might chase some monkeys, but not necessarily all donkeys chasing all monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude that statement 5 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased every monkey.\n- Since we do not have information that contradicts the possibility of some donkeys chasing all monkeys, we cannot definitively say that no donkeys chased every monkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that statement 6 must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true according to the given information is:\n\n**Statement 1: A monkey chased a donkey.**",

Not all monkeys ate just in case a human saw Hazel.\n7. Every monkey chased Hazel just in case not all humans kicked Lewis.\n8. If a human chased Lewis, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n\n### Analyzing Each Statement:\n\n#### Statement 1: Not all donkeys saw Hazel and no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- From point 3, we know no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- From point 8, if a human chased Lewis, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis only if not all donkeys saw Hazel. However, this does not provide enough information to conclude that not all donkeys saw Hazel. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n#### Statement 2: If every donkey saw Hazel, then a donkey kicked Hazel.\n- This statement is logically equivalent to \"If all donkeys saw Hazel, then no donkeys kicked Hazel.\" Since from point 3, we know no donkeys kicked Hazel, this statement is false because it would imply that if all donkeys saw Hazel, then no donkeys kicked Hazel, which is consistent with the given information. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys kicked Hazel and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n- From point 3, we know no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- From point 1, everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey. Since Hazel is seen by other entities (like humans and monkeys), it is reasonable to assume Hazel is a human or a monkey. However, the statement \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" contradicts the fact that Hazel saw Hazel. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys kicked Hazel and Hazel saw Hazel.\n- From point 3, we know no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- From point 1, Hazel saw Hazel. This statement is consistent with the given information. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No donkeys kicked Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n- From point 3, we know no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- The statement \"no donkeys saw Hazel\" is not necessarily true based on the given information. Hazel could have been seen by other entities like humans or monkeys. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\n- From point 3, we know no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n- The statement \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" contradicts the fact that Hazel saw Hazel.

Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n**Statement 2: A human saw every monkey that saw it.**\n- This statement is redundant with the third statement provided. It essentially restates the condition that every human saw every monkey that saw it. Since the third statement is true, this one must also be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Every human saw every monkey.**\n- This would mean that every single human saw every single monkey. However, the third statement only says that every human saw every monkey that saw it, which does not necessarily imply that every human saw every monkey. For example, if there are two humans and two monkeys, and the first human sees both monkeys while the second human sees none, then the third statement holds but the third statement does not hold. Thus, this statement cannot be definitively true based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 4: A human saw a monkey.**\n- Since there is at least one human and at least one monkey, and every human saw every monkey that saw it, it follows that at least one human must have seen at least one monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Every human saw a monkey.**\n- Similar to Statement 3, this would mean that every single human saw every single monkey. As explained earlier, this is not necessarily true based on the given conditions.\n\n**Statement 6: A human saw every monkey.**\n- This is similar to Statement 3 and cannot be definitively true based on the given conditions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 2: A human saw every monkey that saw it.\n- Statement 4: A human saw a monkey.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n2, 4",

Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey chased every monkey.\n- The information states that every monkey chased a donkey, but it does not imply that every donkey chased every monkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey chased at least one monkey.\n- The information states that every monkey chased a donkey, which implies that every donkey was chased by at least one monkey (since every monkey chased a donkey). Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey chased every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that at least one donkey chased all the monkeys.\n- The information does not provide enough details to conclude that a specific donkey chased all the monkeys. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey chased a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that at least one donkey chased at least one monkey.\n- The information states that every monkey chased a donkey, which means that every donkey was chased by at least one monkey.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. A human saw a monkey that saw a monkey.\n4. Hazel doesn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n5. No donkeys kicked Alfred unless every donkey attacked.\n6. Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n7. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every donkey saw a human.\n- This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. The information does not specify that every donkey must see a human. It only mentions that Hazel didn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys saw a human.\n- This statement also cannot be concluded from the given information. The information does not specify that no donkeys saw a human. It only mentions that Hazel didn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys saw every human.\n- This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. The information does not specify that no donkeys saw every human. It only mentions that Hazel didn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey saw a human.\n- This statement can be concluded from the given information. Since there is at least one human and Hazel doesn't see Hazel, it implies that Hazel is not a human. Given that Hazel didn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel, Hazel must have seen a human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every donkey saw every human.\n- This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. The information does not specify that every donkey must see every human. It only mentions that Hazel didn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey saw every human.\n- This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. The information does not specify that every donkey must see every human. It only mentions that Hazel didn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: A donkey saw a human.**",

            "raw_response": "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and deduce which statements must be true based on those conditions. Let's break down the information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means every entity is categorized as either a donkey, a human, or a monkey, with no overlap between categories, and there is at least one of each type.\n\n2. **Not all monkeys will run but it is not the case that Lewis didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - This implies that some monkeys do not run, and Lewis chased Hazel.\n\n3. **Every monkey will run unless every donkey is happy.**\n   - This means if every donkey is happy, then every monkey will run. Otherwise, not all monkeys will run.\n\n4. **Alfred isn't a human unless no donkeys are happy.**\n   - This means if Alfred is a human, then no donkeys are happy. Conversely, if Alfred is not a human, then at least one donkey is happy.\n\n5. **If every monkey chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This means if all monkeys chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n\n6. **If every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if every human saw Hazel.**\n   - This means if all monkeys chased Hazel, then for Lewis to be a donkey, every human must have seen Hazel. However, since Lewis is not a human, this condition does not apply directly.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: Every donkey is happy.**\n- From condition 3, if every donkey is happy, then every monkey will run. But from condition 2, not all monkeys will run. Therefore, it cannot be true that every donkey is happy.\n\n**Statement 2: Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n- We know from condition 3 that if every donkey is happy, then every monkey will run. Since not all monkeys will run (condition 2), it follows that not all donkeys will run. So, this statement is consistent with the conditions.\n\n**Statement 3: Not all donkeys are happy.**\n- If not all donkeys are happy, then it doesn't necessarily mean that not all monkeys will run. It could still be possible that some donkeys are happy and some aren't, leading to some monkeys running. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: No donkeys are happy.**\n- If no donkeys are happy, then every monkey will run (condition 3). However, from condition 2, not all monkeys will run. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Only donkeys are happy.**\n- If only donkeys are happy, then every monkey will run (condition 3). But from condition 2, not all monkeys will run. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n**Statement 6: Alfred will run.**\n- From condition 4, if every monkey chased Lewis, then not all donkeys saw Lewis. However, we don't have enough information about whether Alfred is a human or not, nor do we know if Lewis was chased by monkeys. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Alfred will run.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**Final Answer: Statement 2: Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: a donkey, a human, and a monkey.\n3. There is a monkey that every donkey kicked.\n4. No donkeys kicked Alfred unless not all donkeys will attack.\n5. If not all humans are asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every monkey is hungry.\n6. If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n7. Alfred isn't hungry.\n8. Lewis is a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: No donkeys kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that no single donkey kicked all monkeys. However, we know from point 3 that there is a monkey that every donkey kicked. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every donkey kicked every monkey.\n- This statement implies that every donkey kicked every monkey. From point 3, we know there is a specific monkey that every donkey kicked, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every monkey. Thus, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys kicked a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that no donkey ever kicked a monkey. However, point 3 tells us that there is a specific monkey that every donkey kicked. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A donkey kicked every monkey.\n- This statement suggests that at least one donkey kicked every monkey. Since point 3 states that there is a monkey that every donkey kicked, this statement could potentially be true. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that every donkey kicked every monkey. So, we need more information to confirm this.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a donkey that every monkey kicked.\n- This statement suggests that there is at least one donkey that kicked every monkey. From point 3, we know there is a specific monkey that every donkey kicked, which means there is indeed a donkey that kicked this particular monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey kicked a monkey.\n- This statement suggests that at least one donkey kicked a monkey. From point 3, we know there is a specific monkey that every donkey kicked, meaning at least one donkey did kick a monkey. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, statements 5 and 6 must be true. Statements 1, 2, and 3 are false because they contradict the given information. Statement 4 is also false as it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nFinal Answer: 5 and 6",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. A human chased every donkey that chased it.\n4. No monkeys chased a human that chased it.\n5. Hazel doesn't see Hazel but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then Lewis is hungry only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n7. Not all donkeys chased Alfred and Alfred isn't hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\"\n  - From the given information, we know that Hazel doesn't see Hazel, which means Hazel is not a donkey (since donkeys can't see themselves). Therefore, Hazel is either a human or a monkey.\n  - Since Hazel is not a donkey, the first part of the statement (\"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\") is true.\n  - The second part of the statement (\"Hazel didn't chase Alfred\") is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information about whether Hazel is a donkey or not. If Hazel were a donkey, she could have chased Alfred. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 2:** \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\"\n  - Similar to Statement 1, since Hazel is not a donkey, the first part is true.\n  - The second part is also not necessarily true because we don't have enough information about whether Alfred is a donkey or not. If Alfred were a donkey, he could have chased himself. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 3:** \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\"\n  - This statement is contradictory. We already established that Hazel is not a donkey, so the first part is true. However, the second part cannot be true because Hazel is not a donkey, and therefore, she couldn't have chased Alfred. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n- **Statement 4:** \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n  - The first part is true because not all donkeys chased Alfred is given.\n  - The second part is true because Hazel doesn't see Hazel, which means Hazel is not a donkey. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n- **Statement 5:** \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\"\n  - The first part is true as explained above.\n  - The second part is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information about whether Alfred is a donkey or not. If Alfred were a donkey, he could have chased himself. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n- **Statement 6:** \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n  - The first part is true as explained above.\n  - The second part is true because Hazel is not a donkey, and thus, no donkeys would have seen her. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- Statement 4: \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\"\n- Statement 6: \"Hazel didn't chase Alfred and no donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are **Statements 4 and 6**.",

Therefore, statement 2 must be false.\n- Statement 3 (\"A donkey saw Hazel\") cannot be true because it contradicts point 5.\n- Statement 4 (\"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\") can be true since it does not contradict any given information.\n- Statement 5 (\"Hazel saw a donkey\") cannot be determined from the given information. It could be true or false.\n- Statement 6 (\"Not all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel saw Hazel\") is impossible because if Hazel saw a donkey, then not all donkeys saw Hazel would be false. Thus, statement 6 must be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is statement 4: \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\"\n\nFinal Answer: 4",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. No monkeys chased Lewis.\n4. A human is happy and Lewis didn't kick Alfred.\n5. No donkeys kicked Hazel and Alfred is happy.\n6. If every monkey is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From point 4, we know that a human is happy and Lewis did not kick Alfred.\n- From point 5, we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel and Alfred is happy.\n- Point 6 introduces a conditional statement: \"If every monkey is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\"\n\nLet's consider the implications of these points:\n- Since no donkeys kicked Hazel (point 5), it means that the donkeys did not kick Hazel.\n- Since Alfred is happy (point 5), he did not kick Hazel.\n- The condition in point 6 can be simplified as follows:\n  - If every monkey is asleep, then Alfred didn't kick Hazel.\n  - This implies that if Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then every monkey must be asleep (because if not all donkeys kicked Hazel, Alfred could have kicked Hazel).\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Alfred and Hazel are asleep.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude that both Alfred and Hazel are asleep based on the given information. They could be awake, just not sleeping together.\n   \n2. **Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude that Alfred is not asleep. He could be asleep, but the information does not rule out this possibility.\n   \n3. **Alfred and Lewis are asleep.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude that Alfred and Lewis are asleep. They could be awake, just not sleeping together.\n   \n4. **No donkeys kicked Hazel and every human is happy.**\n   - From point 5, we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel and a human is happy. Therefore, this statement is true.\n   \n5. **A human is happy and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This statement is essentially the same as statement 4, so it is also true.\n   \n6. **Alfred is asleep.**\n   - We cannot definitively conclude that Alfred is asleep. He could be awake, just not sleeping.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- Statement 4: No donkeys kicked Hazel and every human is happy.\n- Statement 5: A human is happy and no donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n- **4. No donkeys kicked Hazel and every human is happy.**\n- **5. A human is happy and no donkeys kicked Hazel.**",

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. No monkeys chased Hazel.\n4. A monkey chased a monkey that chased a human.\n5. If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n6. A human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel.\n7. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Not all monkeys chased Hazel.\n- From point 4, we know that a monkey chased a monkey that chased a human. This implies that there is at least one monkey who chased a human, and thus, at least one monkey did not chase Hazel (since no monkeys chased Hazel). Therefore, it is possible for not all monkeys to have chased Hazel. Hence, this statement could be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Hazel chased every monkey.\n- We do not have any direct information about whether Hazel chased every monkey. The given conditions do not provide enough information to conclude this. Hence, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel chased a monkey.\n- Since there is at least one monkey and no monkeys chased Hazel, Hazel must have chased a monkey. This follows directly from the given conditions. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every monkey chased Hazel.\n- Similar to Statement 2, we do not have any direct information to conclude that every monkey chased Hazel. Hence, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A monkey chased Hazel.\n- From point 4, we know that a monkey chased a monkey that chased a human. This implies that there is at least one monkey who chased a human, and since no monkeys chased Hazel, this monkey must have chased a human instead. Thus, a monkey did chase Hazel. Hence, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred is a donkey.\n- The given conditions do not provide any information about Alfred's species. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Alfred is a donkey or not. Hence, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 3: Hazel chased a monkey.\n- Statement 5: A monkey chased Hazel.\n\nFinal Answer: 3, 5",

So, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans kicked a monkey.\n- This contradicts the information from point 3, which states that every human kicked a monkey. Hence, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 4: No humans kicked every monkey.\n- Similar to statement 3, this contradicts the information from point 3. Since every human kicked a monkey, it means that no human could have kicked every monkey. Thus, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a human that every monkey kicked.\n- The given information does not provide any details about whether a single human kicked all monkeys or if multiple humans kicked different monkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude this statement as necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every human kicked every monkey.\n- The given information does not specify that every human kicked every monkey. It only states that every human kicked a monkey that kicked it. Hence, this statement cannot be concluded as necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is statement 1: \"A human kicked a monkey.\"\n\nFinal Answer: 1",

We do not have enough information about whether some donkeys chased Alfred or not. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- Alfred didn't chase Alfred (given in Statement 3).\n- Lewis is not a donkey (given in Statement 6), so it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey. This part is true.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all donkeys chased Alfred and Lewis is a donkey.\n- We know Lewis is not a donkey (Statement 6), so this part is false.\n- The statement \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred\" cannot be definitively concluded from the given information. We do not have enough information about whether some donkeys chased Alfred or not. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred didn't chase Alfred and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- Alfred didn't chase Alfred (given in Statement 3).\n- Lewis is not a donkey (given in Statement 6).\n- Both parts of the statement are true.\n\n#### Statement 5: If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n- We do not have information about whether any donkeys chased Alfred or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether Lewis chased Lewis or not. This statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n- We do not have information about whether any donkeys chased Alfred or not.

Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. No donkeys saw Lewis.\n4. Every monkey saw Alfred.\n5. Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n6. A monkey chased Alfred.\n7. A monkey saw Alfred only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred isn't a donkey.\n- If Alfred were a donkey, then no donkeys would see him, which contradicts the fact that every monkey saw him. Since there are monkeys, this cannot be true. Therefore, Alfred must be either a human or a monkey. This statement could be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Lewis chased Lewis.\n- According to the given information, a monkey saw Alfred only if Lewis chased Lewis. However, we do not have enough information to determine whether Lewis chased Lewis or not. This statement could be true or false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis is a donkey.\n- If Lewis were a donkey, then no donkeys would see him, which again contradicts the fact that every monkey saw him. Since there are monkeys, this cannot be true. Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey. This statement could be true or false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n- We know that a monkey saw Alfred only if Lewis chased Lewis. Since there are monkeys, this means Lewis must have chased Lewis for some monkeys to see Alfred. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Alfred is a donkey.\n- If Alfred were a donkey, then no donkeys would see him, which contradicts the fact that every monkey saw him. Since there are monkeys, this cannot be true. Therefore, Alfred must be either a human or a monkey. This statement could be true or false.\n\n#### Statement 6: Lewis isn't a donkey.\n- If Lewis were a donkey, then no donkeys would see him, which contradicts the fact that every monkey saw him. Since there are monkeys, this cannot be true. Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey. This statement could be true or false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis, we can conclude that the only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: Lewis didn't chase Lewis.**\n\nThis conclusion is derived from the fact that if Lewis chased Lewis, it would imply that a monkey saw Alfred, which is only possible if Lewis chased Lewis. Since we know that a monkey saw Alfred, Lewis must have chased Lewis, making this statement false.",

Thus, it is possible that Hazel saw a monkey.\n- Therefore, this statement could be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A monkey saw Hazel.\n- From point 3, we know that a monkey saw every human.

If Alfred didn't kick Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every human.\n- This statement suggests that for every human, there exists a donkey that kicked them.\n- However, we do not have enough information to conclude that every single donkey kicked every single human. It could be that some donkeys kicked more than one human, while others did not kick any humans.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- This statement implies that every donkey kicked every human.\n- We know that every human kicked a donkey, but this does not necessarily mean that every donkey kicked every human. For example, a donkey might have been kicked by multiple humans, but not by every single donkey.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- This statement suggests that every donkey kicked at least one human.\n- From the information that every human kicked a donkey, it follows that every donkey must have been kicked by at least one human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys kicked a human.\n- This statement contradicts the fact that every human kicked a donkey. Since every human kicked a donkey, it means that at least one donkey was kicked by each human, making this statement false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey kicked a human.\n- This statement is consistent with the information that every human kicked a donkey. Since there is at least one human and at least one donkey, it is possible that a donkey kicked a human. However, we cannot definitively say that \"a donkey kicked a human\" without additional specific details about which donkey and which human.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- This statement is consistent with the information that every human kicked a donkey, meaning no single donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 3: Every donkey kicked a human.\n- Statement 6: No donkeys kicked every human.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n- **Statement 3 and Statement 6** must be true.",

Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every human.\n- This statement cannot be definitively concluded from the given information. The information states that every donkey kicked a human that kicked it, but it does not specify that every donkey kicked every single human.\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys kicked a human.\n- This statement is also not necessarily true. The information states that every donkey kicked a human that kicked it, which means some donkeys did kick humans.\n\n#### Statement 3: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- Similar to Statement 1, this cannot be definitively concluded. The information states that every donkey kicked a human that kicked it, but it does not specify that no donkey kicked every single human.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every donkey kicked every human.\n- This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. The information states that every donkey kicked a human that kicked it, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every single human.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a donkey that every human kicked.\n- This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. The information states that every donkey kicked a human that kicked it, but it does not imply that there is a specific donkey that kicked every human.\n\n#### Statement 6: A donkey kicked a human.\n- This statement must be true. According to the information, every donkey kicked a human that kicked it. Since there is at least one donkey and at least one human, it follows that a donkey must have kicked a human.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 6: A donkey kicked a human.**",

Therefore, this statement cannot be true because it contradicts the fact that Lewis saw donkeys.\n\n**Statement 2: Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n- Since Lewis saw every donkey, it follows that every donkey saw Lewis. This statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 3: Lewis saw a donkey.**\n- As mentioned, Lewis saw every donkey, so this statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 4: A donkey saw Lewis.**\n- Since Lewis saw every donkey, it follows that at least one donkey (specifically, the ones Lewis saw) saw Lewis. This statement must be true.\n\n**Statement 5: Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n- Since Lewis saw every donkey, it means all donkeys saw Lewis. This statement is false.\n\n**Statement 6: No donkeys saw Lewis.**\n- This directly contradicts the fact that Lewis saw every donkey.

Alfred is happy but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.\n4. Lewis saw Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis is happy.\n5.

This implies that if Hazel chased Lewis, Lewis would see Lewis.\n\n### Evaluating Statements:\n1. **Not all donkeys are happy.**\n   - We know there is at least one donkey who is not happy (Lewis). Therefore, not all donkeys are happy. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **No donkeys are happy.**\n   - This contradicts the fact that there is at least one donkey who is not happy. Hence, this statement cannot be true.\n\n3. **Every donkey is happy or no donkeys are happy.**\n   - This is a disjunction (either every donkey is happy or no donkeys are happy). Since we know there is at least one donkey who is not happy, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **A donkey is happy.**\n   - We have established that there is at least one donkey who is not happy. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **Only donkeys are happy.**\n   - This statement suggests that no humans or monkeys are happy. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that no humans or monkeys are happy. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n6. **Every donkey is happy.**\n   - This contradicts the fact that there is at least one donkey who is not happy.

Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n4. No donkeys saw every monkey.\n5. There is a human that every donkey chased.\n6. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey kicked Lewis only if every human saw Hazel.\n7. Not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n8. Hazel saw Alfred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey chased a human.\n- From premise 5, we know there is a human that every donkey chased. This implies that at least one donkey chased a human. Therefore, statement 1 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a donkey that every human chased.\n- Premise 5 states that there is a human that every donkey chased. This does not imply that every donkey chased every human. It only specifies one specific human being chased by all donkeys. Thus, statement 2 may not necessarily be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every donkey chased every human.\n- Premise 5 only tells us about one specific human being chased by all donkeys. It does not provide information about whether every donkey chased every human. Therefore, statement 3 may not necessarily be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys chased a human.\n- Premise 5 states that there is a human that every donkey chased. This directly contradicts statement 4. Therefore, statement 4 must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A donkey chased every human.\n- Similar to statement 3, premise 5 only tells us about one specific human being chased by all donkeys. It does not imply that every donkey chased every human. Therefore, statement 5 may not necessarily be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: No donkeys chased every human.\n- Since premise 5 indicates that there is at least one human that every donkey chased, it means that not all donkeys chased every human. Therefore, statement 6 must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n1. A donkey chased a human.\n6.

            "raw_response": "To solve this problem, let's break down the given information and analyze it step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is either a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively).\n2. There is at least one of each: at least one donkey, at least one human, and at least one monkey.\n3. A monkey saw Hazel.\n4. A human is happy and only humans drank.\n5. Lewis saw Alfred and every monkey saw Alfred.\n6. Every donkey is happy unless Hazel doesn't see Alfred.\n7. Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n8. Lewis isn't happy.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Since Hazel didn't chase Hazel, Hazel cannot be a donkey (as donkeys are always happy).\n- Since Hazel is not a donkey, she must be either a human or a monkey.\n- Since a human is happy and only humans drank, Hazel being a human implies that Hazel is happy.\n- Since Hazel is happy, according to the condition \"Every donkey is happy unless Hazel doesn't see Alfred,\" Hazel seeing Alfred means no donkey can be unhappy. Therefore, Hazel must be a human.\n- Since Hazel is a human, she saw a monkey (because a monkey saw Hazel). This means Hazel is not a monkey.\n- Since Hazel is a human, she did not see Alfred directly (since only humans saw Alfred and she is already accounted for as seeing a monkey).\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce:\n- Hazel is a human.\n- Hazel saw a monkey.\n- Since Hazel is a human, she did not see Alfred directly.\n- Since Hazel saw a monkey, the monkey could have seen Alfred.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Alfred saw a monkey.**\n   - We know a monkey saw Hazel, and since Hazel saw a monkey, it is possible that Alfred saw a monkey. However, we do not have enough information to definitively say Alfred saw a monkey. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - We know a monkey saw Hazel, and since Hazel saw a monkey, it is possible that the same monkey saw Alfred. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n3. **A monkey saw Alfred.**\n   - We know a monkey saw Hazel, and since Hazel saw a monkey, it is possible that the same monkey saw Alfred. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Not all monkeys saw Alfred.**\n   - We know a monkey saw Hazel, and since Hazel saw a monkey, it is possible that the same monkey saw Alfred. Thus, not all monkeys saw Alfred. This statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred drank.**\n   - We know only humans drank, and since Hazel is a human, Alfred could have drunk. However, we do not have direct information about whether Alfred drank or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred saw every monkey.**\n   - We know a monkey saw Hazel, and since Hazel saw a monkey, it is possible that the same monkey saw Alfred. However, we do not have information that every monkey saw Alfred. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true based on the given information are:\n- 3. A monkey saw Alfred.\n- 4. Not all monkeys saw Alfred.\n\nFinal Answer: 3 and 4.",

Hazel saw Hazel and only donkeys are asleep.\n\n### Analysis of Statements:\n\n#### Statement 1: Hazel doesn't see Hazel and every human is happy.\n- From the given information, we know that every human is happy.\n- However, the statement \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" does not follow from the given information. It is possible for Hazel to see Hazel without contradicting the given facts.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A human is happy and Hazel doesn't see Hazel.\n- We know that every human is happy, so this part is true.\n- The statement \"Hazel doesn't see Hazel\" does not follow from the given information. It is possible for Hazel to see Hazel without contradicting the given facts.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Hazel saw Hazel and every human is happy.\n- From the given information, we know that every human is happy.\n- The statement \"Hazel saw Hazel\" follows from the given information since Hazel saw Hazel.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: A human is happy but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.\n- We know that every human is happy, so this part is true.\n- The statement \"it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" contradicts the given information that Hazel saw Hazel.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.\n- This statement is logically equivalent to saying \"Every human is asleep if and only if not all humans are asleep.\"\n- If all humans were asleep, then it would be impossible for any humans to be awake, which means not all humans are asleep.\n- Conversely, if not all humans are asleep, then at least one human is awake, meaning not every human is asleep.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.\n- The given information does not provide any details about whether donkeys will run or not.\n- Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of this statement based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- Statement 3: Hazel saw Hazel and every human is happy.\n- Statement 5: Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.\n\nFinal Answer: 3, 5",

However, it is explicitly stated that Hazel did not see Alfred.

Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 3: Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel.**\n- Since every monkey ate, the condition \"not all monkeys ate\" is false. Thus, the statement \"Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel\" is also false.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a monkey ate.**\n- We know that Hazel saw Alfred, so Alfred does not see Hazel. The fact that every monkey ate does not provide a direct link between Alfred not seeing Hazel and a monkey eating. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n**Statement 5: Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred.**\n- We know that every monkey ate, and Hazel saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 6: If a monkey saw Alfred, then Hazel ate.**\n- We know that every monkey ate, but we do not have information about whether Hazel ate or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if a monkey saw Alfred, then Hazel ate.
