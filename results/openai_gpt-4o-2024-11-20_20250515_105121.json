Also, there is at least one of each.\n\n2. **A tove and a borogove chortled at Bungo**: This means there is at least one tove and one borogove.\n\n3. **Every rath chortled at Bungo**: All raths chortle at Bungo.\n\n4. **No borogoves are beamish**: This directly tells us that borogoves are not beamish.\n\n5. **It is not the case that Rafin is a rath**: This implies Rafin is either a tove or a borogove.\n\n6. **No toves snicker-snacked Bungo**: This doesn't directly affect the logical reasoning for this problem.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Only borogoves are beamish**:\n   - False.

Every tove galumphed over Rafin, and every tove is beamish.\n\nFrom the above:\n- Clause 5 states that \"every tove galumphed over Rafin\" conflicts with Clause 4's first part (\"no toves galumphed over Rafin\"). This indicates that the second part of Clause 4 (\"every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\") must be true.\n- Clause 3 further confirms that every tove is beamish, meaning \"every tove galumped over Rafin.\"\n\n**What we know now:**\n- Every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n- Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\n- Every tove is beamish.\n\n**Evaluating the provided statements:**\n1. **Statement 1:** \"If no toves galumphed over Bungo, then not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin only if Zindle is beamish.\"\n   - Since every tove galumped over Rafin, this doesn't directly conflict but need not necessarily hold. **Not necessarily true.**\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If a tove snicker-snacked Rafin, then every borogove galumphed over Zindle only if Bungo isn\u2019t beamish.\"\n   - This has no direct connection to the given conditions about toves, borogoves, or snicker-snacking. **Not necessarily true.**\n\n3. **Statement 3:** \"If a tove snicker-snacked Rafin, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all borogoves are beamish.\"\n   - This is unrelated to the given facts. **Not necessarily true.**\n\n4. **Statement 4:** \"No toves snicker-snacked Rafin if and only if a borogove galumphed over Bungo.\"\n   - Toves are confirmed to be beamish and galumphed over Rafin, so the first part of the statement is false. Hence, the whole statement is false. **False.**\n\n5. **Statement 5:** \"Every borogove is beamish if and only if no toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n   - Since every tove galumphed over Rafin, the condition for \"no toves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is false; thus, this statement is false as well. **False.**\n\n6. **Statement 6:** \"Every borogove galumphed over Rafin just in case no toves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n   - Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, and every tove galumphed over Rafin.
