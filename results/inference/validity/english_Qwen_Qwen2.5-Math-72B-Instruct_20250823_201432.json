So, every human kicked \\( D_1 \\).\n\n3. **If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This statement is complex, but it can be broken down as follows:\n     - If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then the statement \"not all donkeys kicked Hazel only if no monkeys kicked Hazel\" is true.\n     - This means that if no monkeys kicked Hazel, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n   - However, this statement does not provide direct information about the actions of the donkeys, humans, or monkeys in general, so we will not use it to determine the truth of the statements.\n\n4. **A human saw Lewis and only donkeys are asleep.**\n   - This means that Lewis is not a donkey (since only donkeys are asleep), and a human saw Lewis.\n   - Therefore, Lewis is either a human or a monkey.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **A human kicked a donkey.**\n   - From the second piece of information, we know that there is a donkey \\( D_1 \\) that every human kicked.

If not all monkeys saw Hazel, then some donkeys are not happy.\n   - **Statement 3: If Hazel isn't a human, then Hazel is a human.**\n     This is a tautology. It implies that Hazel must be a human.\n   - **Statement 4: If Lewis doesn't see Lewis, then Hazel didn't chase Lewis.**\n     This statement is not directly relevant to the other statements and does not provide additional information about Hazel or the other animals.\n   - **Statement 5: Not all donkeys chased Alfred but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n     This tells us that some donkeys did not chase Alfred and that Hazel did not see herself.\n\n3. **Determine the implications:**\n   - Since Hazel must be a human (from Statement 3), we can focus on the statements involving Hazel.\n   - From Statement 1, we know that a human saw a donkey. Since Hazel is a human, it is possible that Hazel saw a donkey, but it is not necessarily true that Hazel saw a donkey.\n   - From Statement 6, we know that Hazel did not see herself. This does not provide information about whether Hazel saw other humans or not.\n\n4. **Evaluate the given options:**\n   - **Option 1: A human saw Hazel.**\n     Since Hazel is a human, it is possible that another human saw Hazel, but it is not necessarily true.\n   - **Option 2: Every human saw Hazel.**\n     There is no information to suggest that every human saw Hazel.\n   - **Option 3: Hazel saw every human.**\n     There is no information to suggest that Hazel saw every human.\n   - **Option 4: No humans saw Hazel.**\n     There is no information to suggest that no humans saw Hazel.\n   - **Option 5: Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n     This is a possible scenario since we do not know if every human saw Hazel or not.\n   - **Option 6: Hazel saw a human.**\n     Since Hazel is a human, it is possible that Hazel saw another human, but it is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The only statement that must be true based on the given information is that not all humans saw Hazel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

However, since we don't have enough information to determine whether Alfred sees Lewis or not, we cannot definitively say this statement is true.\n\n5. **A human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.**\n   - This statement is true because it is given that a human saw Lewis and Alfred isn't asleep.\n\n6. **Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless a human is asleep.**\n   - This statement is false because we don't have information about whether Alfred sees Lewis or not, and we know that Alfred isn't asleep. Therefore, the condition \"a human is asleep\" could be true or false, but we cannot definitively say that Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless a human is asleep.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n3. No humans are hungry.\n4. If every donkey saw Hazel, then every monkey saw Lewis.\n\n### Statements to Evaluate:\n1. Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n2. Alfred is hungry.\n3. A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\n4. Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no humans are hungry.\n5. If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n6. Alfred and Hazel are hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis are hungry.\n- We know that no humans are hungry. If Alfred is a human, then Alfred is not hungry. Therefore, Alfred and Lewis cannot both be hungry.\n- This statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Alfred is hungry.\n- We know that no humans are hungry. If Alfred is a human, then Alfred is not hungry. If Alfred is a donkey or a monkey, we have no information about his hunger.\n- This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A human saw Alfred just in case Hazel isn't hungry.\n- We know that no humans are hungry, so Hazel is not hungry. Therefore, the condition \"Hazel isn't hungry\" is always true.\n- For the statement to be true, a human must always see Alfred. However, we have no information about whether a human sees Alfred or not.\n- This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case no humans are hungry.\n- We know that no humans are hungry, so the condition \"no humans are hungry\" is always true.\n- For the statement to be true, Alfred must always not see Hazel. We are given that Alfred doesn't see Hazel, so this condition is satisfied.\n- This statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: If no humans are hungry, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel.\n- We know that no humans are hungry, so the condition \"no humans are hungry\" is always true.\n- For the statement to be true, if Alfred saw Alfred, then every human must have seen Hazel. However, we have no information about whether Alfred saw Alfred or whether every human saw Hazel.\n- This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred and Hazel are hungry.\n- We know that no humans are hungry. If Alfred is a human, then Alfred is not hungry. If Hazel is a human, then Hazel is not hungry. Therefore, Alfred and Hazel cannot both be hungry.\n- This statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true is Statement 4.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

Alfred chased a donkey.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Every monkey chased every donkey. This means if \\( M \\) is a monkey and \\( D \\) is a donkey, then \\( M \\) chased \\( D \\).\n- A human chased a human that chased a donkey. Let's call the humans \\( H_1 \\) and \\( H_2 \\).

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n2. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - We know that not all monkeys kicked Lewis, so this statement is false.\n3. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - We know that not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel, so this statement is false.\n4. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - This statement is true based on the given conditions.\n5. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.**\n   - We don't know whether Hazel sees Hazel or not, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n6. **Hazel saw Hazel and not all monkeys kicked Lewis.**\n   - We don't know whether Hazel saw Hazel or not, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is statement 4.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{4}",

So, \\( M_1 \\) saw \\( H_1 \\) and \\( H_1 \\) saw \\( M_2 \\).\n\n3. **Lewis saw every human.**\n   - This means if \\( H \\) is any human, then Lewis saw \\( H \\).\n\n4. **No donkeys chased Alfred just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement: if no donkeys chased Alfred, then every monkey chased Hazel. Let's denote this as \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\forall M \\, C(M, H) \\), where \\( D \\) is the statement \"a donkey chased Alfred\" and \\( C(M, H) \\) is the statement \"monkey \\( M \\) chased Hazel\".\n\n5. **If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This is another conditional statement: if not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then if Hazel kicked Alfred, then not all donkeys kicked Hazel.

Every donkey chased Alfred unless every donkey kicked Lewis.\n4. Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n5. Not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\n6. No humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis drank.\n- There is no information directly about whether Alfred or Lewis drank. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No humans are hungry unless only donkeys drank.\n- From condition 6, we know that no humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel. There is no information about the relationship between the drinking of donkeys and the hunger of humans. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No humans are hungry or only donkeys drank.\n- From condition 6, we know that no humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel. There is no information about the relationship between the drinking of donkeys and the hunger of humans. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Not all donkeys drank just in case no humans are hungry.\n- From condition 6, we know that no humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel. From condition 5, we know that not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel. Therefore, not all donkeys drank just in case no humans are hungry. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all humans are hungry and every donkey drank.\n- From condition 6, we know that no humans are hungry just in case every monkey chased Hazel. From condition 5, we know that not all donkeys drank if and only if every monkey chased Hazel. Therefore, if every donkey drank, then not every monkey chased Hazel, and thus humans could be hungry. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred drank.\n- There is no information directly about whether Alfred drank. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this statement must be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true is Statement 4.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{4}",

Each type is present.\n- **Condition 2:** No donkeys chased Lewis.\n- **Condition 3:** If not all humans chased Lewis, then no humans are asleep.\n- **Condition 4:** A human will attack and only donkeys are asleep.\n\nFrom Condition 4, we can infer that:\n- There is at least one human who will attack.\n- All donkeys are asleep.\n- No humans are asleep (since only donkeys are asleep).\n\nFrom Condition 3, since no humans are asleep, it must be true that not all humans chased Lewis. Therefore, the statement \"No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis\" is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **No humans chased Lewis.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. We know that not all humans chased Lewis, but it is possible that some humans chased Lewis.\n\n2. **Not all humans chased Lewis.**\n   - This is true. Since no humans are asleep and the condition \"No humans are asleep only if not all humans chased Lewis\" is satisfied, it must be true that not all humans chased Lewis.\n\n3. **Every human chased Lewis.**\n   - This is false. It contradicts the fact that not all humans chased Lewis.\n\n4. **Lewis chased a human.**\n   - There is no information given about whether Lewis chased a human or not.

Every human kicked every donkey.\n3. A human saw a monkey that saw a donkey.\n4. Alfred didn't kick Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n5. If Hazel is hungry, then not all donkeys kicked Alfred only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n6. A human saw Lewis and a monkey is hungry.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **A donkey kicked a human.**\n   - From condition 2, every human kicked every donkey. This does not imply that any donkey kicked any human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n   - From condition 2, every human kicked every donkey. This does not provide any information about donkeys kicking humans. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - From condition 2, every human kicked every donkey. This does not imply that every donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **A donkey kicked every human.**\n   - From condition 2, every human kicked every donkey. This does not imply that any donkey kicked any human, let alone every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n   - From condition 2, every human kicked every donkey. This does not imply that any donkey kicked any human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **There is a donkey that every human kicked.**\n   - From condition 2, every human kicked every donkey.

The given statement can be written as \\( H \\leftrightarrow L \\).\n\n3. **If Alfred doesn't see Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if every monkey is hungry.**\n   - Let \\( A \\) be the statement \"Alfred sees Lewis\" and \\( M \\) be the statement \"Every monkey saw Lewis\" and \\( N \\) be the statement \"Every monkey is hungry\". The given statement can be written as \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow (M \\rightarrow N) \\).\n\n4. **A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - Let \\( P \\) be the statement \"A human saw Lewis\" and \\( Q \\) be the statement \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\". The given statement can be written as \\( P \\land \\neg Q \\).\n\nFrom the fourth piece of information, we know that \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false. Since \\( Q \\) is false, \\( L \\) must be true (because \\( Q \\) is \"Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" and \\( L \\) is \"Lewis saw Hazel\"). Therefore, \\( L \\) is true.\n\nSince \\( L \\) is true, from the second piece of information \\( H \\leftrightarrow L \\), we can conclude that \\( H \\) is true. So, no humans are hungry.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **No humans are hungry.**\n   - This is true because we have already concluded that \\( H \\) is true.\n\n2. **Only humans are hungry and not all humans are hungry.**\n   - This is false because no humans are hungry, so it is not the case that only humans are hungry.\n\n3. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - We do not have any information about Alfred's hunger, so we cannot conclude this statement is true.\n\n4. **Every human is hungry.**\n   - This is false because no humans are hungry, so it is not the case that every human is hungry.\n\n5. **Only humans are hungry.**\n   - This is false because no humans are hungry, so it is not the case that only humans are hungry.\n\n6. **A human is hungry.**\n   - This is false because no humans are hungry, so it is not the case that a human is hungry.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then a human chased Hazel. However, if Lewis chased Lewis, then no human chased Hazel. Since the statement \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is a contradiction (Lewis cannot not chase himself), the condition is always false. Therefore, the statement \"A human chased Hazel\" is always false.\n\n4. **A human will attack and Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - This statement is also a conditional statement. If Hazel didn't chase Hazel, then a human will attack. However, since the statement \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is a contradiction (Hazel cannot not chase herself), the condition is always false. Therefore, the statement \"A human will attack\" is always false.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the statements:\n\n1. **A donkey saw a human.**\n   - Since every human saw every donkey, it follows that every donkey was seen by every human. Therefore, it is possible that a donkey saw a human, but it is not necessarily true that a donkey saw a human. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every donkey saw every human.**\n   - The information given does not provide any evidence that every donkey saw every human. It only states that every human saw every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey saw a human.**\n   - Since every human saw every donkey, it follows that every donkey was seen by every human. Therefore, it is true that every donkey saw a human. This statement is true.\n\n4. **A donkey saw every human.**\n   - The information given does not provide any evidence that a donkey saw every human. It only states that every human saw every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **No donkeys saw every human.**\n   - The information given does not provide any evidence that no donkey saw every human. It only states that every human saw every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **A human saw every donkey.**\n   - The information given states that every human saw every donkey. Therefore, it is true that a human saw every donkey. This statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n3. Every donkey saw a human.\n6.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. If a monkey chased Hazel, then every donkey saw Hazel.\n3. Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Hazel.\n4. Hazel saw Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy.\n\nFrom the given information, we can deduce the following:\n- There is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n- Every monkey ate.\n- Hazel saw Hazel.\n- Hazel saw Alfred.\n- Lewis is happy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. Every monkey ate but it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred.\n   - We know that every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n   - We know that every monkey ate, so not all monkeys ate is false. Since the condition \"not all monkeys ate\" is false, the entire statement is true (because a false condition implies anything).\n\n3. If a monkey saw Alfred, then Hazel ate.\n   - We don't have any information about whether Hazel ate or not, and the statement does not provide any direct relationship between a monkey seeing Alfred and Hazel eating. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of this statement.\n\n4. A monkey saw Alfred only if Hazel ate.\n   - Again, we don't have any information about whether Hazel ate or not, and the statement does not provide any direct relationship between a monkey seeing Alfred and Hazel eating. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of this statement.\n\n5. Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred.\n   - We know that every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a monkey ate.\n   - We know that a monkey ate, so the condition \"a monkey ate\" is true. Since the condition \"a monkey ate\" is true, the entire statement is false (because Alfred does see Hazel).\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 2: Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel.\n- Statement 5: Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred.\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the statement that must be true, and only one answer is typically expected, we should choose the most straightforward and directly supported statement, which is:\n\n\\boxed{5}",

Every monkey chased a monkey.\n4. No monkeys chased every monkey.\n5. Every monkey chased every monkey.\n6. A monkey chased every monkey.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\n   - This statement is given as a fact in the problem. Therefore, it must be true.\n\n2. A monkey chased a monkey.\n   - From the given information, we know that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it. This implies that if any monkey chased another monkey, then the chased monkey also chased the chasing monkey. However, it does not necessarily mean that a monkey chased a monkey directly. It is possible that no monkeys chased each other at all. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. Every monkey chased a monkey.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true because it is possible that no monkeys chased each other at all. The given information only tells us that if a monkey chased another monkey, then the chased monkey also chased the chasing monkey. It does not guarantee that every monkey chased another monkey.\n\n4. No monkeys chased every monkey.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. If there is only one monkey, then that monkey chased itself, which means it chased every monkey (since there is only one monkey). Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. Every monkey chased every monkey.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. If there is more than one monkey, it is possible that not every monkey chased every other monkey. The given information only tells us that every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, not that every monkey chased every other monkey.\n\n6. A monkey chased every monkey.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. If there is more than one monkey, it is possible that no monkey chased every other monkey.

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every monkey kicked every monkey.\n3. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.\n4. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the type of Lewis\nFrom condition 3, we know that not all monkeys kicked Lewis. Since every monkey kicked every monkey, Lewis cannot be a monkey. Therefore, Lewis is either a donkey or a human.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the type of Alfred\nFrom condition 3, we know that Lewis saw Alfred. Since Lewis is not a monkey, he is either a donkey or a human. If Lewis is a donkey or a human, he can see Alfred, who could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the type of Hazel\nFrom condition 4, we know that if Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey is asleep only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel. Since Lewis is not a monkey, he cannot chase himself. Therefore, the condition simplifies to: every monkey is asleep only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the sleep status of the monkeys\nFrom condition 2, we know that every monkey kicked every monkey. Therefore, if there is at least one monkey, all monkeys must be kicking each other. This means that the condition \"every monkey is asleep\" is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the sleep status of Alfred and Hazel\nSince the condition \"every monkey is asleep only if not all donkeys kicked Hazel\" is not necessarily true, we cannot definitively determine the sleep status of Hazel. However, we can determine the sleep status of Alfred based on the information given.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that Lewis saw Alfred. Since Lewis is not a monkey, he can see Alfred, who could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey. However, we do not have enough information to determine if Alfred is asleep or not.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is that Lewis is not a monkey.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{6}",

Therefore, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey. But since we already know Lewis is happy and every human is happy, Lewis must be a human.\n- Hazel didn't chase Hazel, which is a tautology (it is always false that Hazel chases Hazel).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **A human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - A human is happy is true.\n   - It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey is false (since Lewis is a human).\n   - Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n2. **Every human is happy but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - Every human is happy is true.\n   - It is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey is false (since Lewis is a human).\n   - Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n3. **Alfred ate.**\n   - There is no information given about whether Alfred ate or not.\n   - Therefore, the statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This is a tautology (it is always true that every human is asleep if and only if not all humans are asleep).\n   - Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis ate.**\n   - There is no information given about whether Alfred ate or not.\n   - Therefore, the statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Every human is happy and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - Every human is happy is true.\n   - Lewis isn't a donkey is true (since Lewis is a human).\n   - Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nThe statements that must be true are 4 and 6.

Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 are not necessarily true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios for Hazel:\n\n- **Hazel is a donkey:**\n  - If Hazel is a donkey, then the statement \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" does not necessarily hold because all donkeys saw Hazel.\n  - However, if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then the condition \"a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" must hold, but we do not have enough information to determine if this condition is true or false.\n\n- **Hazel is not a donkey:**\n  - If Hazel is not a donkey, then the statement \"If not all donkeys saw Hazel, then a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" does not necessarily hold because the condition \"a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" does not necessarily have to hold if all donkeys saw Hazel.\n  - However, if not all donkeys saw Hazel, then the condition \"a human chased Hazel only if Hazel kicked Hazel\" must hold, but we do not have enough information to determine if this condition is true or false.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to determine if Hazel is a donkey or not, statements 5 and 6 are not necessarily true.\n\nFinally, let's analyze statement 4:\n- **A human will attack and no humans will attack:**\n  - This statement is a contradiction.

Therefore, there is a donkey (in fact, every donkey) that every human chased. This statement is true.\n\n3. **A donkey chased a human.**\n   - There is no information given that directly implies this. It is possible that no donkey chased any human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - There is no information given that directly implies this. It is possible that some donkeys chased some humans, but not necessarily that no donkey chased every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every human.**\n   - There is no information given that directly implies this. It is possible that no donkey chased any human, or that some donkeys chased some humans, but not necessarily that a donkey chased every human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - There is no information given that directly implies this. It is possible that no donkey chased any human, or that some donkeys chased some humans, but not necessarily that every donkey chased a human. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 2: There is a donkey that every human chased.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's analyze the given statements step by step and determine which one must be true based on the provided conditions.\n\n### Given Conditions:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Every donkey kicked a donkey.\n3. Alfred isn't a human unless every donkey kicked Lewis.\n4. A human chased Hazel only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n5. If Lewis is a donkey, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n6. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n7. Hazel is a monkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the type of Lewis\n- From condition 4, since a human chasing Hazel implies Lewis didn't chase Lewis, and since a human chasing Hazel is possible, Lewis must not chase Lewis. This means Lewis cannot be a human.\n- From condition 5, if Lewis is a donkey, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis. Since Hazel is a monkey, if Lewis is a donkey, Hazel kicked Alfred only if every monkey kicked Lewis. However, we don't have enough information to determine if every monkey kicked Lewis, so we cannot definitively say if Hazel kicked Alfred or not.\n- From condition 3, Alfred isn't a human unless every donkey kicked Lewis. Since we don't know if every donkey kicked Lewis, we cannot definitively say if Alfred is a human or not.\n- Therefore, Lewis must be a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the type of Alfred\n- From condition 6, not all donkeys kicked Alfred. This means there is at least one donkey that did not kick Alfred.\n- From condition 3, Alfred isn't a human unless every donkey kicked Lewis. Since Lewis is a monkey, this condition does not provide any information about Alfred being a human or not.\n- Therefore, Alfred can be either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the type of Hazel\n- From condition 7, Hazel is a monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the statements\n1. **No donkeys kicked every donkey.**\n   - This statement is true because if every donkey kicked every donkey, then all donkeys would have kicked Alfred, which contradicts condition 6.\n2. **There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.**\n   - This statement is false because if there were a donkey that every donkey kicked, then all donkeys would have kicked Alfred, which contradicts condition 6.\n3. **A donkey kicked a donkey.**\n   - This statement is true because it is given that every donkey kicked a donkey.\n4. **Every donkey kicked every donkey.**\n   - This statement is false because if every donkey kicked every donkey, then all donkeys would have kicked Alfred, which contradicts condition 6.\n5. **No donkeys kicked a donkey.**\n   - This statement is false because it is given that every donkey kicked a donkey.\n6. **A donkey kicked every donkey.**\n   - This statement is false because if a donkey kicked every donkey, then all donkeys would have kicked Alfred, which contradicts condition 6.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n5. No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine Lewis's Identity\n- From condition 2: No donkeys kicked every human.\n- From condition 3: Lewis kicked every human.\n- Therefore, Lewis cannot be a donkey (because if he were, he would not have kicked every human).\n\nSo, Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Drinking Condition\n- From condition 4: Only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.\n- Since Lewis is not a donkey, the condition \"every donkey kicked Lewis\" is irrelevant to the drinking condition.\n- Therefore, the condition simplifies to \"Only donkeys drank.\"\n- This means that no humans or monkeys drank.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Chasing Condition\n- From condition 5: No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\n- Since Lewis is either a human or a monkey, he cannot chase himself (because chasing is an action between two distinct entities).\n- Therefore, the condition \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is always true.\n- This means that the condition simplifies to \"No donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n- This condition does not provide any information about Alfred's drinking or identity.\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - True, as determined in Step 1.\n\n2. **Alfred and Lewis drank.**\n   - False, because no humans or monkeys drank (Step 2).\n\n3. **Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - False, as determined in Step 1.\n\n4. **Alfred drank.**\n   - False, because no humans or monkeys drank (Step 2).\n\n5. **Lewis drank.**\n   - False, because no humans or monkeys drank (Step 2).\n\n6. **Alfred didn't drink.**\n   - True, because no humans or monkeys drank (Step 2).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{1}\\) Lewis isn't a donkey. \\(\\boxed{6}\\) Alfred didn't drink. \n\nHowever, since the problem asks for a single answer, the most directly supported statement is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{1}\\) Lewis isn't a donkey. \\)",

For every \\( d \\in D \\), there exists \\( h \\in H \\) such that \\( h \\) kicked \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Hazel saw every human.**\n   - Let \\( H \\) be the set of humans.

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n2. **No humans saw Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Hazel saw every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all humans saw Hazel.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that Hazel saw every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Hazel isn't a human if and only if a human saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel saw every human, a human saw Hazel is true. If Hazel is a human, then Hazel saw herself, so a human saw Hazel is still true. If Hazel isn't a human, then a human saw Hazel is still true. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **A human saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel saw every human, a human saw Hazel is true. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **Hazel saw a human.**\n   - This is given directly in the information.

A monkey chased a monkey that chased a monkey.\n4. If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it.**\n   - This implies that for every monkey \\( M \\), there exists a donkey \\( D \\) such that \\( M \\) kicked \\( D \\) and \\( D \\) kicked \\( M \\).\n\n2. **A monkey chased a monkey that chased a monkey.**\n   - This implies that there exists a chain of monkeys \\( M_1, M_2, M_3 \\) such that \\( M_1 \\) chased \\( M_2 \\), \\( M_2 \\) chased \\( M_3 \\), and \\( M_3 \\) chased \\( M_1 \\).\n\n3. **If every monkey chased Hazel, then Hazel kicked Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. If every monkey chased Hazel, then:\n     - If no monkeys kicked Hazel, Hazel kicked Alfred.\n     - If any monkey kicked Hazel, Hazel did not kick Alfred.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **A donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The given information only states that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every monkey.\n\n2. **Every donkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The given information only states that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked a monkey.\n\n3. **No donkeys kicked every monkey.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The given information does not provide any information about donkeys kicking every monkey.\n\n4. **Every donkey kicked every monkey.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The given information only states that every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it, but it does not imply that every donkey kicked every monkey.\n\n5. **A donkey kicked a monkey.**\n   - This statement is true. From the given information, every monkey kicked a donkey that kicked it. Therefore, there must be at least one donkey that kicked a monkey.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked a monkey.**\n   - This statement is false.

There is a human that every donkey kicked.\n3. Every human chased every donkey that chased every donkey.\n4. No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis saw Alfred.\n5. Every donkey saw Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n6. No donkeys chased Alfred if and only if a monkey ate.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - This statement is too strong. The condition only states that there is a human that every donkey kicked, not that every donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n2. **A donkey kicked every human.**\n   - This statement is also too strong. The condition only states that there is a human that every donkey kicked, not that a donkey kicked every human. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\n3. **Every donkey kicked a human.**\n   - This statement is true. The condition states that there is a human that every donkey kicked. Therefore, every donkey kicked at least one human, which is the human that every donkey kicked. So, this statement must be true.\n\n4. **Every human is asleep just in case not all humans are asleep.**\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction. If every human is asleep, then all humans are asleep, which means it is not true that not all humans are asleep. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n5. **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n   - This statement is false. The condition states that there is a human that every donkey kicked, which means that there is at least one human that every donkey kicked. Therefore, it is not true that no donkeys kicked every human.\n\n6. **No donkeys kicked a human.**\n   - This statement is false. The condition states that there is a human that every donkey kicked, which means that every donkey kicked at least one human. Therefore, it is not true that no donkeys kicked a human.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true is statement 3: \"Every donkey kicked a human.\"\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Alfred is a monkey.\n3. Hazel saw Lewis.\n4. If not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\n5. If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\n6. Only donkeys are asleep but it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep.\n\nFrom the sixth statement, we can deduce:\n- Only donkeys are asleep.\n- Hazel is not asleep (since it is not the case that Hazel isn't asleep).\n\nSince Hazel is not asleep and only donkeys are asleep, Hazel must be either a human or a monkey. Given that Alfred is a monkey, Hazel must be a human.\n\nNow, let's analyze the fifth statement:\n- If not all humans are asleep, then Lewis is hungry only if no humans are hungry.\nThis statement implies that if there is at least one human who is not asleep, then Lewis being hungry implies that no humans are hungry. This is a contradiction unless Lewis is not hungry. Therefore, if not all humans are asleep, Lewis cannot be hungry.\n\nNext, let's analyze the fourth statement:\n- If not all humans are asleep, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if Lewis is hungry.\nSince we have established that if not all humans are asleep, Lewis cannot be hungry, the condition \"only if Lewis is hungry\" is false. Therefore, the statement \"not all donkeys saw Hazel\" must be false. This means that all donkeys saw Hazel.\n\nNow, we know:\n- Hazel is a human and not asleep.\n- All donkeys saw Hazel.\n- Hazel saw Lewis.\n\nFrom the fact that all donkeys saw Hazel and Hazel saw Lewis, it follows that all donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, the statement \"Every donkey saw Lewis\" must be true.\n\nLet's check the other statements:\n1. A donkey saw Lewis: This is true because all donkeys saw Lewis.\n2. Not all donkeys saw Lewis: This is false because all donkeys saw Lewis.\n3. Lewis saw every donkey: We do not have information about whether Lewis saw every donkey.\n4. No donkeys saw Lewis: This is false because all donkeys saw Lewis.\n5. Every donkey saw Lewis: This is true.\n6.

This implies Hazel is not a donkey (since no donkeys saw a donkey).\n- Therefore, Hazel is either a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Alfred's Species\n- Every monkey chased Alfred. If Hazel were a monkey, then Hazel would have chased Alfred, which is consistent with the condition. However, if Hazel were a human, this condition does not provide any contradiction.\n- Therefore, Alfred could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine Lewis's Species\n- Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey kicked Hazel.\n- If Hazel is a human, then no monkey kicked Hazel, so Lewis must be a donkey.\n- If Hazel is a monkey, then a monkey kicked Hazel, so Lewis could be a human or a monkey.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the Conditions Based on Hazel's Species\n\n##### Case 1: Hazel is a Human\n- Lewis is a donkey.\n- If no humans chased Hazel, then not all humans chased Lewis. Since Hazel is a human and no humans chased Hazel, not all humans chased Lewis. This is consistent.\n- If every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if every human saw Hazel. Since Hazel is a human, not every monkey chased Hazel, so this condition is vacuously true.\n- Therefore, if Hazel is a human, Lewis is a donkey.\n\n##### Case 2: Hazel is a Monkey\n- Lewis could be a human or a monkey.\n- If no humans chased Hazel, then not all humans chased Lewis. This condition does not provide any contradiction.\n- If every monkey chased Hazel, then Lewis is a donkey only if every human saw Hazel. Since every monkey chased Alfred, this condition does not provide any contradiction.\n- Therefore, if Hazel is a monkey, Lewis could be a human or a monkey.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Hazel is not a donkey.\n- Alfred could be a donkey, a human, or a monkey.\n- Lewis is a donkey if Hazel is a human, and could be a human or a monkey if Hazel is a monkey.\n\nFrom the given statements:\n1. Hazel is a donkey. (False)\n2. Alfred isn't a donkey. (Not necessarily true)\n3. Hazel isn't a donkey. (True)\n4. Alfred is a donkey. (Not necessarily true)\n5. Lewis isn't a donkey. (Not necessarily true)\n6. Lewis is a donkey. (Not necessarily true)\n\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n\\boxed{3} Hazel isn't a donkey.",

The condition is \"not all humans are asleep,\" and the conclusion is \"a human chased Lewis only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.\"\n   - Since \"Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is a contradiction (it is always false), the statement \"a human chased Lewis only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis\" is always true (because a false statement can imply anything).\n   - Therefore, the entire conditional statement is always true regardless of whether all humans are asleep or not.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Lewis and Alfred ate.**\n   - We know that Lewis ate, but we don't know if Alfred ate. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred didn't eat.**\n   - We don't know if Alfred ate or not. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Lewis ate and Lewis isn't happy.**\n   - We know that Lewis ate, but we also know that Lewis is happy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Lewis ate but it is not the case that Lewis isn't happy.**\n   - This statement is equivalent to \"Lewis ate and Lewis is happy.\" We know that both are true. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Alfred and Lewis ate.**\n   - We know that Lewis ate, but we don't know if Alfred ate. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Alfred ate.**\n   - We don't know if Alfred ate or not.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and determine which of the statements must be true. Let's break down the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means there are at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **Lewis chased Lewis only if not all donkeys are hungry.**\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the statement \"Lewis chased Lewis\" and \\( D \\) be the statement \"Not all donkeys are hungry\". The condition can be written as \\( L \\rightarrow D \\).\n\n3. **A human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel.**\n   - Let \\( H_a \\) be the statement \"A human is asleep\" and \\( H_c \\) be the statement \"Every human chased Hazel\". The condition can be written as \\( H_a \\leftrightarrow H_c \\).\n\n4. **Every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel.**\n   - Let \\( M_c \\) be the statement \"Every monkey chased Hazel\". The condition can be written as \\( M_c \\leftrightarrow H_c \\).\n\nFrom the conditions, we can deduce that \\( H_a \\leftrightarrow H_c \\) and \\( M_c \\leftrightarrow H_c \\). Therefore, \\( H_a \\leftrightarrow M_c \\). This means a human is asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **A human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This is true because \\( H_a \\leftrightarrow M_c \\).\n\n2. **If not all humans are asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - Let \\( \\neg H_a \\) be the statement \"Not all humans are asleep\". The statement can be written as \\( \\neg H_a \\rightarrow (M_c \\rightarrow \\neg H) \\), where \\( H \\) is the statement \"Hazel chased Hazel\". Since \\( M_c \\leftrightarrow H_c \\) and \\( H_a \\leftrightarrow H_c \\), if not all humans are asleep, then not all humans chased Hazel, so not all monkeys chased Hazel. Therefore, the statement \\( M_c \\rightarrow \\neg H \\) is vacuously true because \\( M_c \\) is false. So, this statement is true.\n\n3. **If not all humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey is asleep.**\n   - Let \\( M_a \\) be the statement \"Every monkey is asleep\". The statement can be written as \\( \\neg H_a \\rightarrow (\\neg H \\rightarrow M_a) \\). Since \\( M_c \\leftrightarrow H_c \\) and \\( H_a \\leftrightarrow H_c \\), if not all humans are asleep, then not all humans chased Hazel, so not all monkeys chased Hazel. However, we cannot conclude that every monkey is asleep. Therefore, the statement \\( \\neg H \\rightarrow M_a \\) is not necessarily true, so this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This is false because \\( H_a \\leftrightarrow M_c \\), so if every monkey chased Hazel, then all humans are asleep, not the other way around.\n\n5. **Every human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.**\n   - This is true because \\( H_a \\leftrightarrow M_c \\).\n\n6. **If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.**\n   - The statement can be written as \\( H_a \\rightarrow (M_c \\rightarrow \\neg H) \\). Since \\( H_a \\leftrightarrow M_c \\), if every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel. However, we cannot conclude that Hazel didn't chase Hazel. Therefore, the statement \\( M_c \\rightarrow \\neg H \\) is not necessarily true, so this statement is false.\n\nThe statements that must be true are 1, 2, and 5. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1, 2, 5}\n\\]",

Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Hazel is a monkey.\n3. If Alfred won't attack, then not all donkeys saw Hazel only if not all donkeys will run.\n4. If Lewis didn't chase Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis only if a human chased Hazel.\n5. A human will attack and every monkey chased Alfred.\n\nWe need to determine which of the following statements must be true:\n1. Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n2. Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n3. Alfred chased Hazel.\n4. Alfred and Lewis will run.\n5. Alfred will run.\n6. Hazel chased Alfred.\n\nLet's analyze each statement one by one:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given statements\n**Statement 5: A human will attack and every monkey chased Alfred.**\n- This tells us that there is at least one human who will attack.\n- Every monkey, including Hazel, chased Alfred.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that Hazel chased Alfred. Therefore, statement 6 is true and statement 1 is false.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the other statements\n**Statement 3: Alfred chased Hazel.**\n- We know that Hazel chased Alfred, but we don't have any information about whether Alfred chased Hazel or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred chased Hazel.\n\n**Statement 2: Alfred didn't chase Hazel.**\n- Similarly, we know that Hazel chased Alfred, but we don't have any information about whether Alfred chased Hazel or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n\n**Statement 4: Alfred and Lewis will run.**\n- We don't have any information about whether Alfred or Lewis will run or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred and Lewis will run.\n\n**Statement 5: Alfred will run.**\n- We don't have any information about whether Alfred will run or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alfred will run.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is statement 6: Hazel chased Alfred.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

This implies Hazel is not a donkey.\n- **Condition 3**: The statement \"Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred\" is a tautology. It means that if no donkeys chased Alfred, then not all donkeys chased Alfred, which is always true. This condition doesn't provide new information.\n- **Condition 4**: If every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred saw Alfred only if every human saw Hazel. This implies that if every monkey saw Lewis, then Alfred seeing Alfred is conditional on every human seeing Hazel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - From Condition 2, no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is true.\n2. **A donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - From Condition 2, no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, this statement is false.\n3. **Every donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - From Condition 2, no donkeys saw Hazel.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n5. **Hazel saw every donkey.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Hazel, but we don't have information about whether Hazel saw every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n6. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - From Condition 2, no donkeys saw Hazel, so not all donkeys saw Hazel is true. However, Hazel saw Hazel is also true, so it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel is false. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys chased a human that chased it.\n3. Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey.\n4. A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\n\n### Analysis:\nLet's denote the sets as follows:\n- \\( D \\) is the set of donkeys.\n- \\( H \\) is the set of humans.\n- \\( M \\) is the set of monkeys.\n\n#### Condition 2: No donkeys chased a human that chased it.\nThis means if a donkey \\( d \\) chases a human \\( h \\), then \\( h \\) does not chase \\( d \\).\n\n#### Condition 3: Every donkey chased every human that chased every donkey.\nThis means if a human \\( h \\) chases every donkey, then every donkey \\( d \\) chases \\( h \\).\n\n#### Condition 4: A monkey chased a donkey that chased a human.\nThis means there exists a monkey \\( m \\), a donkey \\( d \\), and a human \\( h \\) such that \\( m \\) chases \\( d \\) and \\( d \\) chases \\( h \\).\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n\n1. **A donkey chased every human.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. Condition 3 only implies that if a human chases every donkey, then every donkey chases that human. It does not guarantee that every donkey chases every human.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - This statement is true. From Condition 4, we know there is at least one donkey that chases a human. Since there is at least one donkey and at least one human, and no donkey chases a human that chases it, it is possible for every donkey to chase a human.\n\n3. **No humans chased every donkey.**\n   - This statement is true. If a human chased every donkey, then by Condition 3, every donkey would chase that human. However, this would contradict Condition 2, which states that no donkey chases a human that chases it. Therefore, no human can chase every donkey.\n\n4. **No donkeys chased a human.**\n   - This statement is false. Condition 4 states that a monkey chased a donkey that chased a human, so there is at least one donkey that chases a human.\n\n5. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - This statement is true. If a donkey chased every human, then by Condition 2, no human could chase that donkey. However, this does not necessarily mean that no donkey chases every human, as there could be other donkeys that do not chase every human.\n\n6. **Every donkey chased every human.**\n   - This statement is false. Condition 2 states that no donkey chases a human that chases it. If every donkey chased every human, then every human would be chasing a donkey that chases it, which contradicts Condition 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 2: Every donkey chased a human.\n- Statement 3: No humans chased every donkey.\n- Statement 5: No donkeys chased every human.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2, 3, 5}\n\\]",

This means that some donkeys did not kick Alfred.\n   - If Alfred is a monkey, the statement about donkeys kicking Alfred does not directly affect him.\n\n4. **Evaluate the answer choices:**\n   - **1.

Let's break down the conditions and then evaluate each statement step by step.\n\n### Conditions:\n1. Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n3. Alfred is happy.\n4. A monkey is happy.\n5. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n6. Alfred doesn't see Lewis or a human kicked Lewis.\n7. Every human saw Hazel unless every donkey chased Alfred.\n8. No humans chased Hazel only if Lewis chased Lewis.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### Statement 1: Alfred and Lewis are happy.\n- Alfred is happy (given).\n- Lewis isn't a donkey (given), so he is either a human or a monkey.\n- If Lewis is a monkey, he is happy (since a monkey is happy).\n- If Lewis is a human, we don't have enough information to determine his happiness.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A monkey kicked Hazel or every donkey is happy.\n- No donkeys kicked Hazel (given).\n- Therefore, the statement \"A monkey kicked Hazel or every donkey is happy\" is equivalent to \"A monkey kicked Hazel or every donkey is happy\" is true if a monkey kicked Hazel or every donkey is happy.\n- Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, the statement is true if a monkey kicked Hazel.\n- We don't have enough information to determine if a monkey kicked Hazel.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A monkey kicked Hazel unless every donkey is happy.\n- No donkeys kicked Hazel (given).\n- Therefore, the statement \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless every donkey is happy\" is true if a monkey kicked Hazel or every donkey is happy.\n- Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, the statement is true if a monkey kicked Hazel.\n- We don't have enough information to determine if a monkey kicked Hazel.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No donkeys kicked Hazel and a monkey is happy.\n- No donkeys kicked Hazel (given).\n- A monkey is happy (given).\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 5: A monkey kicked Hazel unless no donkeys are happy.\n- No donkeys kicked Hazel (given).\n- Therefore, the statement \"A monkey kicked Hazel unless no donkeys are happy\" is true if a monkey kicked Hazel or no donkeys are happy.\n- Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, the statement is true if a monkey kicked Hazel.\n- We don't have enough information to determine if a monkey kicked Hazel.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: A monkey kicked Hazel or no donkeys are happy.\n- No donkeys kicked Hazel (given).\n- Therefore, the statement \"A monkey kicked Hazel or no donkeys are happy\" is true if a monkey kicked Hazel or no donkeys are happy.\n- Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, the statement is true if a monkey kicked Hazel.\n- We don't have enough information to determine if a monkey kicked Hazel.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true is Statement 4: No donkeys kicked Hazel and a monkey is happy.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A human is asleep or not all donkeys will run.**\n   - Since only donkeys are asleep, no humans are asleep.

Therefore, the condition \"A human is asleep\" is false.

Alfred isn't a human or every donkey is happy.\n6. Every donkey is happy unless a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\nFirst, let's break down the statements:\n- From statement 2, we know Alfred is a donkey.\n- From statement 3, we know Alfred kicked Alfred.\n- From statement 4, we know that a donkey is happy. Since Alfred is a donkey, Alfred is happy.\n- From statement 5, since Alfred is a donkey, the statement \"Alfred isn't a human\" is true. Therefore, the entire statement \"Alfred isn't a human or every donkey is happy\" is true, which doesn't provide new information.\n- From statement 6, we know that if no monkey kicked Alfred, then every donkey is happy. Since Alfred is happy, it is possible that no monkey kicked Alfred, but it is also possible that a monkey kicked Alfred and some other donkeys are happy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n1. No donkeys kicked Alfred.\n   - There is no information that directly implies no donkeys kicked Alfred. Alfred kicked Alfred, so it is possible that other donkeys kicked Alfred as well.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2.

Alfred is happy.\n   - From statement 4, since Alfred is a donkey, Alfred is happy.\n   - This statement is true.\n\n4. Alfred kicked every donkey.\n   - There is no information that implies Alfred kicked every donkey. Alfred only kicked Alfred, so it is possible that there are other donkeys that Alfred did not kick.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\n   - There is no information that directly implies not all donkeys kicked Alfred. It is possible that all donkeys kicked Alfred, including Alfred himself.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6.

Lewis saw Lewis.\n3. Every donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\n4. Only humans are hungry and every human is happy.\n5. Not all donkeys chased Alfred just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\n6. If a human chased Lewis, then Hazel didn't chase Hazel only if every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **No donkeys chased every donkey.**\n   - This statement implies that there is at least one donkey that did not chase every donkey.\n   - From condition 3, we know that every donkey chased every donkey that chased it. This does not necessarily mean that no donkey chased every donkey. It is possible that some donkeys chased every donkey, but it is also possible that no donkey chased every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Every donkey chased every donkey.**\n   - This statement implies that every donkey chased every other donkey.\n   - From condition 3, we know that every donkey chased every donkey that chased it. This does not necessarily mean that every donkey chased every donkey. It is possible that some donkeys did not chase every donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A donkey chased a donkey.**\n   - This statement implies that there is at least one donkey that chased another donkey.\n   - From condition 3, we know that every donkey chased every donkey that chased it. This means that if any donkey chased another donkey, then the chased donkey also chased the chasing donkey. Therefore, this statement is necessarily true.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased a donkey.**\n   - This statement implies that every donkey chased at least one other donkey.\n   - From condition 3, we know that every donkey chased every donkey that chased it. This does not necessarily mean that every donkey chased at least one other donkey. It is possible that some donkeys did not chase any other donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.**\n   - This statement is exactly the same as condition 3, which is given as true.\n   - Therefore, this statement is necessarily true.\n\n6. **A donkey chased every donkey.**\n   - This statement implies that there is at least one donkey that chased every other donkey.\n   - From condition 3, we know that every donkey chased every donkey that chased it. This does not necessarily mean that there is a donkey that chased every other donkey. It is possible that no donkey chased every other donkey. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- Statement 3: A donkey chased a donkey.\n- Statement 5: A donkey chased every donkey that chased it.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{3, 5}",

Not all donkeys saw Hazel.\n3. A monkey kicked Alfred.\n4. A monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel.\n5. If Alfred ate, then no humans are hungry only if every monkey kicked Lewis.\n6.

There is no information that directly implies Hazel kicked a monkey.\n\n2. **A monkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - From condition 4, a monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel. From condition 2, not all donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, a monkey did not kick Hazel.\n   - This statement is false.\n\n3. **Every monkey kicked Hazel.**\n   - Since a monkey did not kick Hazel (as established in statement 2), this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred ate.**\n   - There is no information that directly implies Alfred ate or did not eat. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **No monkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - From the analysis of statement 2, we know that a monkey did not kick Hazel.

There is a donkey that every human chased.\n3. Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.\n4. Every donkey chased a human.\n5. Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.\n6. No donkeys chased every human.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **No donkeys chased a human.**\n   - This statement contradicts the second condition, which states that every donkey chased every human. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **There is a donkey that every human chased.**\n   - Since every donkey chased every human, it follows that any donkey satisfies this condition. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.**\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it cannot be true that not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis simultaneously. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Every donkey chased a human.**\n   - This statement is true because the second condition states that every donkey chased every human, which implies that every donkey chased at least one human.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it cannot be true that not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run simultaneously. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased every human.**\n   - This statement contradicts the second condition, which states that every donkey chased every human.

Therefore, Lewis must be a human.\n\nNow let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Lewis isn't a human.**\n   - This statement is false because Lewis is a human.\n\n2. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - This statement is false because Alfred isn't hungry.\n\n3. **Lewis is a human.**\n   - This statement is true because Lewis is a human.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - This statement is false because Alfred isn't hungry.\n\n5. **Lewis and Alfred are hungry.**\n   - This statement is false because Alfred isn't hungry.\n\n6. **Alfred and Hazel are hungry.**\n   - This statement is false because Alfred isn't hungry.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.\n3. Lewis saw every donkey.\n4. Not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n5. A donkey saw Lewis.\n6. Lewis saw a donkey.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Every donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This statement contradicts the condition that no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - The condition states that no donkeys saw Lewis, so the first part of the statement is true. However, the condition does not provide any information about what Lewis is, so we cannot determine if Lewis isn't a donkey. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n3. **Lewis saw every donkey.**\n   - The condition does not provide any information about what Lewis saw. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively true.\n\n4. **Not all donkeys saw Lewis.**\n   - This statement is true because the condition states that no donkeys saw Lewis, which implies that not all donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **A donkey saw Lewis.**\n   - This statement contradicts the condition that no donkeys saw Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Lewis saw a donkey.**\n   - The condition does not provide any information about what Lewis saw.

Also, Lewis is not a donkey, so Lewis must be either a human or a monkey.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Lewis is hungry.**\n   - Since only donkeys are hungry and Lewis is not a donkey, Lewis is not hungry.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Alfred isn't hungry.**\n   - Since Alfred is kicked by a monkey, Alfred cannot be a donkey. Therefore, Alfred is not hungry.\n   - Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Alfred is hungry.**\n   - Since Alfred is kicked by a monkey, Alfred cannot be a donkey. Therefore, Alfred is not hungry.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred and Lewis are hungry.**\n   - Since Alfred is not a donkey and Lewis is not a donkey, neither Alfred nor Lewis is hungry.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Alfred and Hazel are hungry.**\n   - Since Alfred is not a donkey, Alfred is not hungry. We do not have enough information to determine if Hazel is a donkey or not, but if she is not a donkey, she is not hungry.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - Since Lewis is not a donkey, Lewis is not hungry.\n   - Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nThe statements that must be true are 2 and 6.

This does not necessarily mean that Lewis did not chase any humans. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A human chased Lewis.\n- This is directly contradicted by the given information that no humans chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Lewis chased every human.\n- Again, we only know that no humans chased Lewis, which does not provide any information about whether Lewis chased every human or not. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every human chased Lewis.\n- This is directly contradicted by the given information that no humans chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Not all humans chased Lewis.\n- Since no humans chased Lewis, it is true that not all humans chased Lewis. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Alfred will attack.\n- The given information states that a human will attack, but it does not specify that Alfred will attack.

So, \\(D_1\\) saw \\(H_1\\) and \\(H_1\\) saw \\(M_1\\).\n\n4. **Hazel didn't chase Alfred and Lewis doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - Hazel did not chase Alfred.\n   - Lewis did not see Hazel.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred and Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - Not all donkeys chased Alfred, so at least one donkey did not chase Alfred.\n   - Hazel saw Alfred.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Hazel saw a donkey.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Alfred, but we don't know if Alfred is a donkey. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel saw a donkey. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **A donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - We don't have any information about any donkey seeing Hazel. Therefore, we cannot conclude that a donkey saw Hazel. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Every donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - We don't have any information that suggests every donkey saw Hazel. Therefore, we cannot conclude that every donkey saw Hazel. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - We don't have any information that suggests no donkeys saw Hazel. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no donkeys saw Hazel. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Not all donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - Since we don't have any information that suggests all donkeys saw Hazel, it is possible that not all donkeys saw Hazel. However, we also don't have any information that directly confirms this. Therefore, we cannot conclude that not all donkeys saw Hazel. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Hazel saw every donkey.**\n   - We know Hazel saw Alfred, but we don't know if Alfred is the only donkey or if Hazel saw any other donkeys. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hazel saw every donkey. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven the information provided, none of the statements must be true.

Every human is asleep just in case not all humans kicked Lewis.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A donkey kicked every human.\nThis statement directly tells us that there is at least one donkey who kicked every human. Therefore, it is true that a donkey kicked a human. This means:\n- Option 1: No donkeys kicked a human. (False)\n- Option 2: Every donkey kicked a human.

(Not necessarily true)\n- Option 6: There is a donkey that every human kicked. (Not necessarily true)\n\n#### Statement 2: No donkeys are happy or every donkey kicked Lewis.\nThis statement is a disjunction. It means that either no donkeys are happy, or every donkey kicked Lewis, or both. However, this statement does not provide any additional information about the kicking behavior of donkeys that is directly relevant to the options we are considering.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every human is asleep just in case not all humans kicked Lewis.\nThis statement is a conditional statement.

Since Hazel is a monkey, Hazel chased Alfred.\n- Therefore, **Statement 3** (Hazel didn't chase Alfred) is false.\n- **Statement 5** (Hazel chased Alfred) is true.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Statements\n- **Statement 2**: Alfred and Lewis will run.\n  - We do not have any information about whether Alfred or Lewis will run, so we cannot determine this.\n- **Statement 4**: Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n  - Since every monkey chased Alfred and Hazel is a monkey, Alfred did not chase Hazel.\n  - Therefore, **Statement 4** is true.\n- **Statement 6**: Alfred will run.\n  - We do not have any information about whether Alfred will run, so we cannot determine this.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **Statement 5**: Hazel chased Alfred.\n- **Statement 4**: Alfred didn't chase Hazel.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{3, 4} (Hazel chased Alfred and Alfred didn't chase Hazel) \\]\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for a single statement that must be true, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{4} (Alfred didn't chase Hazel) \\] (as it is the only single statement that must be true based on the given information). \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\] \\]",

So, \\( H \\) saw \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_1 \\) saw \\( M_2 \\).\n\n3. **Hazel doesn't see Hazel and no donkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - This means Hazel is not a donkey. Since Hazel doesn't see Hazel, Hazel cannot be a monkey (because a monkey would see itself). Therefore, Hazel must be a human.\n\n4. **No donkeys kicked Alfred unless every donkey will attack.**\n   - This means if any donkey kicked Alfred, then every donkey will attack.\n\n5. **Hazel isn't a human only if every donkey saw Hazel.**\n   - Since Hazel is a human, this statement is always true because the condition \"Hazel isn't a human\" is false.\n\n6. **If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred only if no monkeys kicked Hazel.**\n   - If not all donkeys kicked Alfred, then Alfred saw Alfred implies no monkeys kicked Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. **Every donkey saw a human.**\n   - We don't have enough information to conclude that every donkey saw a human.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw a human.**\n   - We know that Hazel is a human and no donkeys saw Hazel, but we don't know if donkeys saw other humans.\n\n3. **No donkeys saw every human.**\n   - Since no donkeys saw Hazel, no donkeys saw every human.\n\n4. **A donkey saw a human.**\n   - We don't have enough information to conclude that a donkey saw a human.\n\n5. **Every donkey saw every human.**\n   - Since no donkeys saw Hazel, this statement is false.\n\n6. **A donkey saw every human.**\n   - Since no donkeys saw Hazel, this statement is false.\n\nThe only statement that must be true is option 3: No donkeys saw every human.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

However, condition 2 states that not all monkeys will run. Therefore, it cannot be true that every donkey is happy.\n   - So, statement 1 is false.\n\n2. **Not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run.**\n   - This statement is a contradiction. It cannot be true that not all donkeys will run and every donkey will run simultaneously.\n   - So, statement 2 is false.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys are happy.**\n   - From condition 4, if not every donkey is happy, then it is possible that not all monkeys will run, which is consistent with condition 2. Therefore, it is possible that not all donkeys are happy.\n   - So, statement 3 is true.\n\n4. **No donkeys are happy.**\n   - If no donkeys are happy, then Alfred is not a human (from condition 5). However, this does not necessarily mean that Alfred is a donkey or a monkey. Additionally, if no donkeys are happy, then every monkey will run (from condition 4), which contradicts condition 2. Therefore, it cannot be true that no donkeys are happy.\n   - So, statement 4 is false.\n\n5. **Only donkeys are happy.**\n   - If only donkeys are happy, then no humans or monkeys are happy. However, this does not necessarily mean that every monkey will run or not run, so it does not directly contradict any of the conditions. Therefore, it is possible that only donkeys are happy.\n   - So, statement 5 is true.\n\n6. **Alfred will run.**\n   - There is no information given about Alfred's running behavior directly. Alfred's behavior depends on his type (donkey, human, or monkey) and the happiness of the donkeys. Therefore, we cannot determine if Alfred will run or not.\n   - So, statement 6 is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n- Statement 3: Not all donkeys are happy.\n- Statement 5: Only donkeys are happy.\n\nHowever, since statement 5 is not necessarily true (it is possible but not guaranteed), the only statement that must be true is statement 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{3}",

We don't have any information about whether all donkeys chased Alfred or not.\n   - So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred but it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - From condition 2, we know that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n   - Therefore, the first part of the statement is true.\n   - The second part of the statement, \"it is not the case that Lewis isn't a donkey,\" is equivalent to saying \"Lewis is a donkey.\" From condition 5, we know that Lewis is not a donkey.\n   - So, the second part of the statement is false.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Not all donkeys chased Alfred and Lewis is a donkey.**\n   - From condition 5, we know that Lewis is not a donkey.\n   - Therefore, the second part of the statement is false.\n   - So, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred didn't chase Alfred and Lewis isn't a donkey.**\n   - From condition 2, we know that Alfred didn't chase Alfred.\n   - Therefore, the first part of the statement is true.\n   - From condition 5, we know that Lewis is not a donkey.\n   - Therefore, the second part of the statement is true.\n   - So, this statement is true.\n\n5. **If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis.**\n   - We don't have any information about whether Lewis chased Lewis or not.\n   - Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of this statement based on the given conditions.\n\n6. **No donkeys chased Alfred only if Lewis didn't chase Lewis.**\n   - This statement is the contrapositive of the previous statement, \"If Lewis chased Lewis, then some donkeys chased Alfred.\"\n   - Again, we don't have any information about whether Lewis chased Lewis or not.\n   - Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of this statement based on the given conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given conditions is statement 4.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{4}",

Therefore, we cannot conclude that every monkey saw Hazel.\n\n2. **Hazel saw every monkey.**\n   - We have no information about Hazel seeing any monkeys, so we cannot conclude that Hazel saw every monkey.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - We know that a monkey saw every human, but we don't know if Hazel is a human. Therefore, we cannot conclude that not all monkeys saw Hazel.\n\n4. **No monkeys saw Hazel.**\n   - We know that a monkey saw every human, so if Hazel is a human, then a monkey saw Hazel. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no monkeys saw Hazel.\n\n5. **Hazel saw a monkey.**\n   - We have no information about Hazel seeing any monkeys, so we cannot conclude that Hazel saw a monkey.\n\n6. **A monkey saw Hazel.**\n   - If Hazel is a human, then a monkey saw Hazel because a monkey saw every human. If Hazel is a donkey or a monkey, we don't have any information about a monkey seeing Hazel. However, since we know that a monkey is hungry and the statement \"Hazel didn't chase Hazel\" is false, Hazel must be chasing Hazel, which doesn't provide new information about being seen by a monkey. Therefore, the only consistent scenario is that Hazel is a human, and a monkey saw Hazel.\n\nThus, the statement that must be true is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",

The given information only tells us that every donkey kicked a human that kicked it, not that every donkey kicked every human.\n\n2. **No donkeys kicked a human.**\n   - This statement is false because the given information tells us that every donkey kicked a human that kicked it, which implies that at least some donkeys kicked humans.\n\n3. **No donkeys kicked every human.**\n   - This statement is true. Since not all donkeys necessarily kicked every human, this statement is consistent with the given information.\n\n4. **Every donkey kicked every human.**\n   - This statement is false. The given information only tells us that every donkey kicked a human that kicked it, not that every donkey kicked every human.\n\n5. **There is a donkey that every human kicked.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The given information does not provide any information about a specific donkey being kicked by every human.\n\n6. **A donkey kicked a human.**\n   - This statement is true.

Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Everything is a donkey, or a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means there is at least one donkey, one human, and one monkey.\n\n2. **No donkeys saw every human.**\n   - This means there is at least one human that no donkey saw.\n\n3. **Every monkey ate.**\n   - This means all monkeys ate.\n\n4. **It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel.**\n   - This means Hazel is not a human (since humans can see themselves).\n\n5. **Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - This means Hazel is either a donkey or a monkey.\n\n6. **It is not the case that Lewis isn't hungry.**\n   - This means Lewis is hungry.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Every monkey ate but it is not the case that Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - We know that every monkey ate, but we also know that Hazel saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **A monkey saw Alfred only if Hazel ate.**\n   - We don't have any information about whether Hazel ate or not, but we know that Hazel saw Alfred. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n3. **Not all monkeys ate just in case Alfred doesn't see Hazel.**\n   - We know that all monkeys ate, so the condition \"not all monkeys ate\" is false. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Alfred doesn't see Hazel just in case a monkey ate.**\n   - We know that a monkey ate (since all monkeys ate), so the condition \"a monkey ate\" is true. However, we don't have any information about whether Alfred sees Hazel or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred.**\n   - We know that every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n6. **If a monkey saw Alfred, then Hazel ate.**\n   - We don't have any information about whether Hazel ate or not, but we know that Hazel saw Alfred. This statement cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n\\boxed{5}",
