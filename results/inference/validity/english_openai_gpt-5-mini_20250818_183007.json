      "raw_response": "Final answer: Only statement 6 must be true.\n\nReasoning and brief counterexamples:\n\nGiven facts (paraphrased formally):\n- Domain has at least one donkey, one human, one monkey.\n- Exists monkeys m1,m2 and donkey d with Chased(m1,m2) and Chased(m2,d).\n- Hazel saw every monkey: for all x, if x is a monkey then Saw(Hazel,x).\n- Exists a monkey m with Chased(Alfred,m).\n\n1. \"Alfred is a donkey.\" Not forced. Counterexample: let Alfred be a human (or a monkey). All given facts can hold with Alfred human, so 1 is not necessarily true.\n\n2. \"Every monkey saw Hazel.\" Not forced. We only know Hazel saw every monkey (Saw(Hazel, m)), not that monkeys see Hazel (Saw(m, Hazel)). Counterexample: same as above but no monkey sees Hazel \u2014 this satisfies the premises but makes statement 2 false.\n\n3. \"A monkey saw Hazel.\" Not forced. It is consistent that no monkey sees Hazel (Hazel can see them without reciprocity). Counterexample: as in (2), no monkey sees Hazel.\n\n4. \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel.\" Not forced. It's consistent both that not all monkeys saw Hazel and that all monkeys saw Hazel. Counterexample to \"must be true\": take a model where every monkey does see Hazel (Saw(m,Hazel) for all monkeys); that model satisfies the premises, so \"Not all monkeys saw Hazel\" need not hold.\n\n5. \"No monkeys saw Hazel.\" Not forced. Counterexample: take a model where some monkey(s) do see Hazel; that is consistent with the premises, so \"No monkeys saw Hazel\" need not hold.\n\n6. \"Hazel saw a monkey.\" Must be true. Reason: there is at least one monkey (given), and Hazel saw every monkey, so Hazel saw at least one monkey (exists m: monkey(m) and Saw(Hazel,m)). Therefore statement 6 follows from the premises.\n\nThus only statement 6 is entailed by the information.",

Counterexample model: Alfred = human, there is a monkey M who chased Alfred (by the premise), Alfred chases only Alfred. Then no monkey is chased by Alfred, so (1) can be false.\n2. \"Not all monkeys chased Alfred.\" Contradicted by the premise \"every monkey chased Alfred\", so (2) is false.\n3. \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred and a monkey chased Alfred.\" The conjunct \"Alfred didn't chase Alfred\" contradicts the explicit premise that Alfred did chase Alfred, so (3) is false.\n5. \"Alfred chased every monkey.\" Nothing in the premises says Alfred chases monkeys; Alfred may only chase himself, so (5) need not be true.\n6. \"No monkeys chased Alfred.\" Directly contradicted by \"every monkey chased Alfred\", so (6) is false.\n\nExplicit example satisfying all premises but making 1 and 5 false:\n- Domain: {Alfred (human), Daisy (donkey), M (monkey), Hazel (any type but satisfying Hazel chases Hazel)}.\n- Chase relations: Alfred chases Alfred; Hazel chases Hazel; every monkey (M) chases Alfred; Daisy (donkey) does not chase Alfred.\n- Make at least one monkey/human/donkey not run to satisfy the \"not all ... will run\" premises.\n\nThis model meets the given conditions and shows only statement 4 is guaranteed.",

So 1 is entailed.\n\nThe others are not entailed (countermodels exist):\n- 2 (Hazel chased a human): not forced \u2014 Hazel could chase nobody.\n- 3 (Every human chased Hazel): contradicted by the previous sentence, so cannot be guaranteed.\n- 4 (A human chased Hazel): not forced \u2014 it could be that no human chased Hazel (A3 only requires at least one human failed to chase Hazel, not that any did).\n- 5 (Hazel chased every human): not forced \u2014 Hazel need not chase anyone.\n- 6 (No humans chased Hazel): not forced \u2014 it's consistent that some humans did chase Hazel while some did not.\n\nThus only statement 1 must be true.",

Since not every monkey is hungry (Alfred is a monkey and not hungry), the implication (\u2200monkey hungry) \u2192 (\u2200human saw Hazel) is vacuously true, so all premises hold while Run(Alfred) is true.

All premises can still be satisfied, so 2 is not necessary.\n- 4. \"Hazel will run.\" Not forced. If Hazel is a human, the premise \u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 \u00acRun(x)) forces \u00acRun(Hazel).

For example, a model that satisfies all premises:\n  - Entities: Donkey1, Donkey2 (donkeys), M1 (monkey), Alfred, Hazel, Lewis (humans).\n  - Relations: Donkey1 saw M1; M1 saw Donkey2; M1 saw Alfred (since every monkey saw Alfred); Hazel did not chase Alfred; M1 did not kick Lewis (so the antecedent of the conditional is false, making the implication true).\n  In this model Alfred is human (so 2 is false), Alfred sees no monkeys (so 3 and 5 are false), while all premises hold.

Countermodel: let the only human be Hazel, and make Hazel hungry (and asleep). Then all humans are hungry, so \"not all humans are hungry\" is false, while all premises hold.\n\n- 2 (\"Every human is hungry\") need not hold. Countermodel: have two humans Hazel (hungry, asleep) and Bob (not hungry). Put one donkey and one monkey somewhere else. This satisfies all premises but not every human is hungry.\n\n- 4 (\"Alfred is asleep\") need not hold. Make Alfred awake in any model satisfying the premises; nothing forces Alfred to be asleep.\n\n- 5 (\"No humans are hungry\") contradicts the premises (since someone hungry exists and only humans can be hungry), so it is false.\n\n- 6 (\"Only humans are hungry and not all humans are hungry\") is only partly given: \"Only humans are hungry\" is a premise, but \"not all humans are hungry\" is not forced, so 6 need not hold.\n\nTherefore the only statement that must be true is 3.",

Contradicted by the premise \"Every donkey saw every human.\"\n\n2. \"Every donkey saw a human.\" \u2014 True. From \"every donkey saw every human\" and the existence of at least one human, each donkey certainly saw some human. So 2 is entailed.\n\n3. \"Not all monkeys kicked Lewis and every monkey kicked Lewis.\" \u2014 False (and inconsistent). There is no premise about monkeys kicking Lewis, so neither \"every monkey kicked Lewis\" nor its negation is forced; the conjunction of the two parts is contradictory anyway.\n\n4. \"No donkeys saw every human.\" \u2014 False. Directly contradicted by \"Every donkey saw every human.\"\n\n5. \"There is a donkey that every human saw.\" \u2014 Not entailed. The premises only give that donkeys see humans, not that humans see donkeys. A countermodel: one donkey d, humans h1,h2, one monkey m; d sees h1,h2 (satisfying donkey\u2192all humans), h1 sees h2 and h2 sees m (satisfying the human\u2192human\u2192monkey chain), and no human sees d. This satisfies all premises but makes (5) false.\n\n6. Same as 3 \u2014 not entailed (and inconsistent as a conjunction).\n\nThus only statement 2 must be true.",

Then not every donkey chases every monkey.\n\n- To falsify (5) \"There is a donkey that every monkey chased\": use two monkeys M1,M2 and two donkeys D1,D2 with M1 chasing D1 and M2 chasing D2 (no single donkey is chased by every monkey).

No human chased Lewis. All premises hold but Hazel is not hungry, so (1) need not be true.\n\n- Counterexample to 2 (Lewis isn't hungry not required): Use the same model: Lewis is hungry, so \"Lewis isn't hungry\" can be false while all premises hold.\n\n- Counterexample to 5 (both hungry): You can make Lewis not hungry while the monkey is still hungry and Hazel not hungry; premises still hold, so (5) is not forced.\n\n- Counterexample to 6 (Lewis is hungry not required): Make Lewis not hungry and ensure no human chased Lewis (so the conditional about chasing doesn't force Lewis hungry).

The premises only say \"only donkeys ate\" but do not assert that anyone ate, so neither \"Alfred ate\" nor \"Alfred didn't eat\" nor any particular pair ate is guaranteed.\n\n6 (\"A human is happy iff no donkeys chased Alfred\"): The right-hand side (no donkeys chased Alfred) is the universal claim that every donkey did not chase Alfred; the premises give only that not all donkeys chased Alfred (there exists a donkey who did not chase him). So \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" need not hold, hence 6 is not entailed.\n\n2 (\"A human is happy iff not all donkeys chased Alfred\"): The premises explicitly assert both parts:\n- There is a happy human (left side true), and\n- Not all donkeys chased Alfred (right side true).\nSince both sides are true in every model of the premises, the biconditional between them is true in every model.

That is exactly statement 5.\n\nThe other statements need not hold (give counterexamples):\n\n- Statement 1 (\"No humans kicked Hazel\") is not forced: it's consistent with the premises that some humans did kick Hazel, as long as at least one human did not. Example: humans {A,B}, monkeys {M}, donkeys {D}, Hazel = human; M kicked Lewis; A kicked Hazel, B did not. All premises hold but 1 is false.\n\n- Statement 2 (\"Every human kicked Hazel\") contradicts the derived \"not all humans kicked Hazel\", so it cannot be forced.\n\n- Statement 3 (\"A human kicked Hazel\") is not forced: take Hazel to be a donkey (then by \"No humans kicked a donkey\" no human kicks Hazel), while still having at least one monkey (which kicks Lewis) and at least one human \u2014 this satisfies all premises but makes 3 false.\n\n- Statement 4 (\"Hazel kicked a human\") and 6 (\"Hazel kicked every human\") are not implied by the premises; whether Hazel kicks anyone depends on choices not constrained by the given information (so there are models where they are true and models where they are false).\n\nTherefore only (5) must be true.",

If Alfred is not a donkey, there is no premise forcing him to run. So Alfred need not run.\n  - 3 (\"Not all donkeys will run\") contradicts the premise \"every donkey will run\", so it cannot be true.\n  - 4 (\"Alfred and Lewis will run\"): neither Alfred nor Lewis is guaranteed to be a donkey, so they need not run.\n  - 5 (\"No donkeys will run\") contradicts \"every donkey will run\".\n  - 6 (\"Only donkeys will run\") is not forced: humans or monkeys could also run unless explicitly forbidden.\n\nCounterexample sketch for any of 2,4,6: take a model with at least one donkey (which runs by premise), at least one human and at least one monkey, make Alfred a human who does not run and Lewis a monkey who does not run; ensure the other given facts (about who saw whom and who kicked whom) hold.

A model consistent with the premises can make this false (e.g. choose Hazel a human who kicks no one). So (2) need not be true.\n\n3. \"Every donkey kicked Hazel.\" This is refuted directly by (P1). It cannot be true in any model of the premises. So (3) is false (impossible under the premises).\n\n4. \"Hazel kicked a donkey.\" This existential is not implied by the premises; there are models where Hazel kicks no donkey. So (4) need not be true.\n\n5. \"Alfred is asleep.\" From (P2) we only have Asleep(Alfred) -> ... ; that does not force Asleep(Alfred). There are models of the premises with Alfred awake, so (5) need not be true.\n\n6. \"A donkey kicked Hazel.\" This contradicts (P1), so it cannot be true in any model of the premises.

(Statements 2 and 6 must be false; 3, 4 and 5 are independent of the premises.)\n\nReasoning:\n\n- By hypothesis there is at least one human, and every human drank. Hence at least one human drank. So (1) is necessarily true.\n\n- (2) \"No humans drank\" contradicts (1), so (2) must be false.\n\n- (6) \"Not all humans drank\" contradicts \"every human drank\", so (6) must be false.\n\n- The premises do not force that only humans drank (3): it is consistent that some monkey or donkey also drank, and it is also consistent that only humans drank. So (3) is not forced.\n\n- From \"Lewis isn't a donkey\" and \"Lewis is a donkey unless a monkey is hungry\" we get that some monkey is hungry, and Lewis is either human or monkey. Whether Lewis runs is not fixed by the premises: one can build models where Lewis runs (e.g. make Lewis a human who is the running human mentioned) and models where Lewis does not run (e.g. make Lewis a hungry monkey while some other human runs). Thus neither (4) nor (5) is forced.\n\nExample models:\n- Model showing 1 true, 3\u20135 false: Entities {Lewis (human, runs, drank), H2 (human, drank), D1 (donkey, not drank), M1 (monkey, hungry, not drank)}. All premises satisfied; Lewis runs; a monkey is hungry so the \"unless\" clause holds. Here (1) true, (3) false if we let M1 or D1 drink instead in another model.\n- Model showing 5 false: Make Lewis a hungry monkey (not running), have some other human run; still all premises satisfied.\n\nTherefore only statement 1 must be true.",

      "raw_response": "Answer: Only statement 1 must be true.\n\nReasoning:\n- The premises include \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\" That implies, in particular, that any given monkey x has the property \"x chased every monkey that chased x.\" Since the problem also states there is at least one monkey (Hazel), there therefore exists a monkey with that property. So the existential form \"A monkey chased every monkey that chased it.\" (statement 1) is necessarily true.\n\n- None of the other statements is forced by the premises. A simple counterexample (consistent with all premises) shows this. Let the domain be {Hazel (monkey), H (human), Lewis (donkey)}. Let the only kicking facts be Hazel kicked H and H kicked Hazel (satisfying \"A monkey kicked a human that kicked it\"). Let there be no chasing relations at all. Then:\n  - The universal premise \"Every monkey chased every monkey that chased it\" is true vacuously (no monkey was chased by any monkey).\n  - Statement 1 is true (Hazel vacuously chased every monkey that chased her).\n  - Statement 2 (\"A monkey chased a monkey\") is false in this model.\n  - Statement 3 (\"Every monkey chased a monkey\") is false.\n  - Statement 4 (\"No monkeys chased every monkey\") is false in general because it can be violated in other models (and in our model it's true, but the point is it's not logically forced by the premises).\n  - Statement 5 (\"Every monkey chased every monkey\") is false.\n  - Statement 6 (\"A monkey chased every monkey\") is false.\n\nThus only statement 1 must be true in every model consistent with the premises.",

Here are short countermodels (each has exactly three objects: d = a donkey, h = a human, m = a monkey) that satisfy the premises but make the given statement false.\n\nCountermodel A (shows 1,3,5,6 can fail; makes 4 true):\n- Every human chased every donkey: h chases d. (Given.)\n- No donkey chases any human (so d does not chase h).\n- For Lewis: let every human chase Lewis (so the antecedent of the \"only if\" is false), and let the donkey see Lewis (so the consequent could be true).\n- For Alfred/drinking: let d not drink, and let no donkey chase Alfred. (This satisfies the biconditional: \"not all donkeys drank\" iff \"no donkeys chased Alfred\".)\nThis model satisfies all premises. Statement 2 is true (h chased d). Statement 1 (\"every donkey chased every human\") is false because d does not chase h. Statement 3 (\"a donkey chased a human\") is false. Statements 5 and 6 are false.\n\nCountermodel B (shows 4 can fail; also shows 3,5,6 can be true so they are not forced):\n- h chases d (as required).\n- d also chases h and chases Alfred.\n- For Alfred/drinking: because a donkey chases Alfred, \"no donkeys",

This satisfies \"Every donkey chased every human that chased every monkey\" vacuously because no human chases every monkey. Also Alfred does not chase Alfred, and some monkey M can be made happy.\n- Happiness: Happy(M) true; Happy(A) false (so Alfred not happy in this countermodel).\n\nUnder this model:\n- (2) \"A monkey chased Alfred and a monkey is happy\" is false (no monkey chased Alfred).\n- (3) \"Alfred isn't happy\" can be false in other models (we can also set Happy(A) true), so it is not forced; the above model makes (3) true but another model can make (3) false, so it is not entailed.\n- (4), (5), (6) likewise are not forced (we can choose Alfred/Lewis happy or not, and whether any monkey chases Alfred), so none of them must be true.\n\nTherefore only statement 1 is guaranteed by the information given.",

Because humans are forbidden to attack here, this could hold only if nobody attacks, but the premises do not forbid donkeys or monkeys from attacking. So statement 2 can be true in some models (if nobody attacks) and false in others (if a monkey or donkey attacks) \u2014 hence it is not must-true.\n- Statements 1 and 5 (about Alfred and Hazel attacking) are not implied by the premises and likewise can be true in some models and false in others.\n\nExample models:\n- Model showing 2,1,5 need not hold: have a human H and monkey M with H and M chasing each other (satisfying that premise), a donkey D who does not chase Alfred, M who did not kick Hazel, and no one attacks.

Counterexample model showing they can be false while respecting all premises:\n- Domain = {a, h, d, m, l} corresponding to Alfred=a, Hazel=h, one donkey d, one monkey m, Lewis=l.\n- Types: a is human, h is human (or monkey \u2014 only need Hazel drinks), d is donkey, m is monkey, l is human.\n- Drinks: a, h, l drink (so Alfred, Hazel, Lewis drink).\n- Chasing: no one chases Alfred except possibly none; ensure d (the donkey) does NOT chase Alfred to satisfy \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\". Monkeys' chasing condition is vacuously satisfied (no human chases m, or if a human chases m then m chases back in the model).\nThis model satisfies all premises but:\n- 2 (Lewis didn't drink) is false (Lewis drinks here).\n- 3 (Alfred drank and Lewis didn't) is false.\n- 4 (Alfred didn't drink) is false.\n- 5 (Hazel didn't drink) is false.\n- 6 (Alfred is a donkey) is false (Alfred is a human in the model).\n\nThus only statement 1 is guaranteed by the premises.",

No single donkey kicks both d1 and d2, so (1) is false.\n\n- 2. \"No donkeys kicked a donkey.\" Contradicted by the axiom itself, so (2) is false.\n\n- 3. \"Every donkey kicked every donkey.\" Not forced. Same countermodel as for (1) shows (3) false.\n\n- 4. \"There is a donkey that every donkey kicked.\" Not forced. In the mutual-pair model above, no donkey is kicked by both, so (4) is false.\n\n- 6. \"No donkeys kicked every donkey.\" Not forced either. Countermodel: D={d1,d2} with d1 kicked d1 and d2, and d2 kicked d1. This satisfies the axiom (each donkey has a donkey that kicked it: d1 and d2 mutually kick d1; d2 is kicked by d1) and yet d1 kicks every donkey, so (6) is false.\n\nThus only statement 5 must hold in every model satisfying the premises.",

For each one you can exhibit a model satisfying the premises but making the statement false:\n\n- 1 (Alfred and Lewis will attack): take a model with a donkey d, a human h and a monkey m, set Attack(d)=Attack(h)=Attack(m)=false, Drank(d)=true, no donkey saw Lewis, h saw Alfred. This satisfies all premises but Alfred and Lewis do not attack, so 1 is not forced.\n\n- 2 (Alfred won't attack): take a model like above except let Alfred be a donkey and set Attack(Alfred)=",

Hence the conditional yields \"every monkey saw Lewis.\" That is exactly statement 5, so 5 must be true in every model of the premises.\n\n- The other statements are not forced by the premises:\n  - 1 is a contradiction (\"not all monkeys kicked Lewis\" and \"every monkey kicked Lewis\") and cannot be required.\n  - 2 (\"Lewis saw every monkey\") need not hold: the premises give that every monkey saw Lewis, but that is not the same as Lewis seeing every monkey. A countermodel: Alfred is a donkey, there is a monkey M; Lewis saw Alfred, every monkey (including M) saw Alfred, and thus by the conditional every monkey saw Lewis; but Lewis does not see M. This satisfies all premises but falsifies 2 and 6.\n  - 3 (\"Not all monkeys saw Lewis\") and 4 (\"No monkeys saw Lewis\") contradict the derived \"every monkey saw Lewis,\" so they are false.\n  - 6 (\"Lewis saw a monkey\") is not entailed, as shown by the countermodel above (Lewis may see Alfred who is not a monkey, while every monkey still sees Lewis).\n\nTherefore only statement 5 is necessarily true.",

Lewis's happiness is unconstrained, so both \"Lewis is happy\" and \"Lewis isn't happy\" can be true in different models. For example:\n\n  - Model where Lewis is not happy (shows 2,3,4,5 do not have to hold):\n    Universe = {Alfred (human, happy), Lewis (human, not happy), D (donkey), M1 (monkey), M2 (monkey)}\n    No donkey saw Lewis (D did not see Lewis). No monkey is seen by every monkey (e.g. no one saw anyone).\n    This satisfies all premises but makes Lewis not happy.\n\n  - Model where Lewis is happy (shows 3 can hold but is not forced):\n    Same as above but set Lewis happy; still satisfies premises.\n\nThus only statement 1 is logically forced.",

So 2 is entailed by the premises.\n\n3. \"Lewis saw a donkey.\" The premises say nothing about whether Lewis sees any donkey. Both possibilities are consistent: Lewis might see a donkey or might not. So 3 is not guaranteed.\n\n4. \"No donkeys saw Lewis and Lewis isn't a donkey.\" The first conjunct is entailed, but the second is not (Lewis could be a donkey). So the whole statement is not entailed.\n\n5. \"Lewis saw every donkey.\" Not entailed \u2014 Lewis may see none.\n\n6. \"Every donkey saw Lewis.\" Directly contradicted by \u2200x (Don(x) \u2192 \u00acSaw(x, Lewis)), so false.\n\nThus only statement 2 must be true.",

That exactly matches statement 6 (\"A donkey chased every human that chased it\"). So 6 is entailed.\n\n- The other statements are not entailed. A countermodel that satisfies all premises but makes 1\u20135 false:\n\n  Domain = {d (a donkey), h (a human), m (a monkey)}.\n  - Types: d = donkey, h = human, m = monkey (so at least one of each).\n  - Relations:\n    - saw: d saw m, and m saw m (so \"a donkey saw every monkey\" holds because there is only one monkey m and d saw m; and \"Hazel saw Hazel\" can be satisfied by taking Hazel = m).\n    - chased: no one chases anyone (empty relation).\n\n  This model satisfies all premises:\n  - Hazel saw Hazel (m saw m).\n  - A donkey saw every monkey (d saw m).\n  - Every donkey chased every human that chased it (vacuously true because no human chases any donkey).\n\n  But in this model no donkey chases any human, so statements 1\u20135 are false here:\n  1. False (no donkey chased a human).\n  2. False (donkeys do not chase humans at all).\n  3. False (it is false that \"no donkey chased every human\" because the statement 3 claims a universal negative; but it's enough that we can build other models where some donkey does chase every human, so 3 is not logically forced \u2014 in any case the countermodel also shows \u00ac(some donkey chased every human) is true here but 3 claims a universal mustness which is not entailed by the premises).\n  4.

Combining that with existence of a donkey gives: there exists a donkey who did not see Alfred, i.e. \"Not all donkeys saw Alfred\" is true. So statement 5 must be true.\n\nThe others are not forced:\n\n- 1. \"Every donkey saw Alfred\" contradicts \"No donkeys saw Alfred\" (and we do have a donkey), so 1 is false.\n- 3. \"A donkey saw Alfred\" also contradicts \"No donkeys saw Alfred\", so 3 is false.\n- 2, 4, 6 are not entailed by the premises. For example, here is a concrete model satisfying all premises but making 2, 4, and 6 false:\n  - Domain: {Alfred, d, h1, h2, Hazel}\n  - Types: d is a donkey; h1,h2 are humans; Hazel is a monkey; Alfred is a monkey.\n  - Saw relations: Saw(h1, d) and Saw(d, h2) (so \"a human saw a donkey that saw a human\" holds).\n  - No donkey saw Alfred (so Saw(d, Alfred) is false).\n  - Alfred sees nobody (so \"Alfred saw a donkey\" and \"Alfred saw every donkey\" are false).\n  - Hazel is not human, so by the conditional no humans are asleep (so Alfred being asleep is not forced).\n  This model satisfies all given premises but falsifies 2, 4, and 6.\n\nThus only statement 5 is necessarily true.",

So the conjunction in (3) (\"A human saw Lewis and Hazel saw Hazel\") follows directly from the premises. Hence (3) must be true.\n\nFor the others we can give counterexamples (models compatible with the premises) showing they need not hold:\n\n1. \"A human saw Lewis but Lewis sees Hazel\" \u2014 the first conjunct holds by premise, but Lewis need not see Hazel (e.g. take Lewis \u2260 Hazel and no Saw(Lewis,Hazel)). So (1) need not be true.\n\n2. \"Lewis saw Lewis iff a human saw Hazel\" \u2014 nothing forces a biconditional between S(Lewis,Lewis) and some human seeing Hazel; one can build models making the two sides differ. So (2) need not be true.\n\n4. \"Lewis saw Lewis iff not all humans saw Hazel\" \u2014 likewise no reason this biconditional must hold; one can make it false.\n\n5. \"A human saw Lewis and Lewis doesn't see Hazel\" \u2014 the first part is true, but Lewis could be Hazel (or could see Hazel), so the second part need not hold.\n\n6. \"A human saw Lewis but it is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel\" \u2014 contradicts the premise that Hazel does see Hazel, so (6) is false.\n\nTherefore only statement 3 is entailed by the given situation.",

All the others need not be true.\n\nReasoning:\n- The premise \"A donkey saw every human\" is \u2203d \u2208 D \u2200h \u2208 H Saw(d,h). From that it follows immediately that there exists a donkey who saw a human (take any human that donkey saw). So statement 2 (\"A donkey saw a human\") is entailed.\n\n- Statement 1 (\"No donkeys saw every human\") contradicts the premise, so it cannot be true.\n\n- Statements 3 (\"Every donkey saw every human\") and 4 (\"Every donkey saw a human\") are stronger than the given \u2203d \u2200h Saw(d,h) and are not forced by it (other donkeys might not see any humans).\n\n- Statement 5 (\"No donkeys saw a human\") contradicts the given existential, so is false.\n\n- Statement 6 (\"There is a donkey that every human saw\") is the converse of the given and is not entailed.\n\nCounterexample to show the others need not hold:\nLet H = {h}, D = {d1,d2}, M = {m}. Let d1 see h and d2 see nobody. Make all humans asleep so the conditional about Alfred/Lewis/monkeys is vacuously satisfied, and make h not running and Lewis not hungry to satisfy the last sentence.

Since the antecedent (Every donkey saw Hazel) is explicitly given, the consequent follows: Lewis doesn't see Lewis. So statement 2 is true in every model of the situation.\n- From \"Every donkey will run\" we have: (2) For all x, if x is a donkey then x will run. This does not force non-donkeys to run.\n- \"Alfred isn't a human unless only donkeys drank\" is equivalent to Hm(Alfred) -> OnlyDonkeysDrank. It does not force Alfred's type to be donkey (he could be a monkey, or a donkey), so we cannot deduce whether Alfred will run.\n- Nothing forces Hazel to be a donkey, so we cannot deduce that Hazel will run.\n- Statements 1, 3, 4, 5 depend on whether Alfred or Hazel are donkeys (not determined), so none of those must be true in every model.\n- Statement 6 (Lewis saw Lewis) contradicts statement 2, so it is not true.\n\nCounterexamples showing non-necessity:\n- Make Alfred a monkey, Lewis a human, Hazel a monkey, and ensure at least one donkey exists (somebody else). All donkey facts hold and Lewis does not see Lewis follows; Alfred and Hazel need not run. This shows 1,3,4,5,6 are not forced.\n\nTherefore the only statement that must be true is 2.",

Explanation and counterexamples:\n\nFacts given (summarized):\n- Every object is exactly one of {donkey, human, monkey} and there's at least one of each.\n- Alfred is a donkey.\n- Alfred kicked Alfred.\n- \"A donkey is happy.\" (there exists at least one happy donkey)\n- \"Alfred isn't a human or every donkey is happy.\" (this is true because Alfred is a donkey, so the disjunction imposes no new constraint)\n- \"Every donkey is happy unless a monkey kicked Alfred.\" (equivalently: either some monkey kicked Alfred, or every donkey is happy)\n\nWhy (2) is forced:\n- Alfred is a donkey and Alfred kicked Alfred, so there exists a donkey who kicked Alfred. Hence statement (2) \"A donkey kicked Alfred\" must be true in every model of the premises.\n\nWhy the others need not hold (counterexamples showing they are not forced):\n\n1. \"No donkeys kicked Alfred.\" \u2014 False, because Alfred (a donkey) kicked Alfred, so this contradicts the premises.\n\n3. \"Alfred is happy.\" \u2014 Not necessary. Example model: two donkeys (Alfred and D2), one monkey m. Let m kick Alfred, Alfred kick Alfred, and let D2 be the happy donkey. Then the premises hold (a donkey is happy; the \"unless\" clause is satisfied because a monkey kicked Alfred), but Alfred need not be happy. So (3) is not forced.\n\n4. \"Alfred kicked every donkey.\" \u2014 Not necessary. Example: have another donkey D2 who did not get kicked by Alfred (only Alfred kicked himself). All premises can hold, yet Alfred did not kick D2, so (4) can be false.\n\n5. \"Not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" \u2014 Not necessary. Example: take two donkeys and let both (including Alfred) kick Alfred. That satisfies all premises, and then it is false that \"not all donkeys kicked Alfred.\" So (5) is not forced.\n\n6. \"Every donkey kicked Alfred.\" \u2014 Not necessary. Example: as in the counterexample to (4), some donkey D2 may not have been kicked by Alfred, so (6) can be false while all premises hold.\n\nTherefore only statement 2 must be true.",

      "raw_response": "Answer: Only statement 3 must be true.\n\nReasoning:\n- From the premises we have Lewis is a donkey, and the sentence \"No donkeys saw a donkey that saw it\" forbids, for any donkey x and any donkey y, the conjunction (x saw y) and (y saw x). Taking x = Lewis and y = Lewis (Lewis is allowed as \"a donkey\"), this forbids (Lewis saw Lewis). Hence Lewis does not see Lewis \u2014 statement 3 is logically forced.\n\nCounterexamples showing the others need not hold:\n- 1 (Lewis will run): Not forced, because we are told \"Not all donkeys will run\" (\u2203 a donkey that will not run). That donkey might be Lewis, so Lewis may fail to run.\n- 2 (Alfred won't run): Not forced. Take Alfred to be a monkey (or a donkey who simply did not see Lewis), and let Alfred run; this satisfies all premises but makes statement 2 false.\n- 4 (Lewis saw Lewis): Impossible under the premises (see above), so it cannot be true \u2014 in particular it is not forced to be true.\n- 5 (Alfred will run) and 6 (Alfred and Lewis will run): Not forced; one can build models satisfying the premises where Alfred does not run, or where Lewis does not run, etc.\n\nThus only \"Lewis doesn't see Lewis\" (3) must be true.",

Not all humans kicked Lewis.\n  - From \u2200human x \u00ackicked(x,Lewis) we have at least one human (by premise) who did not kick Lewis, so this statement is true in every model.\n\n2. Lewis kicked a human.\n  - We only know Lewis kicked Alfred; Alfred's type is not fixed and could be a donkey or monkey, so Lewis might not have kicked any human. Not forced.\n\n3. Lewis kicked every human.\n  - Nothing forces Lewis to have kicked every human. Not forced.\n\n4. Every human kicked Lewis.\n  - Contradicted by \"No humans kicked Lewis.\" So false.\n\n5. A human kicked Lewis or Lewis kicked Lewis.\n  - \"A human kicked Lewis\" is impossible (by the no-humans premise), so this reduces to \"Lewis kicked Lewis\", which is not implied by the premises. Not forced.\n\n6. A human kicked Lewis.\n  - Directly contradicted by the premises. False.\n\nThus only statement 1 must hold.",

      "raw_response": "Answer: Only statement 2 must be true.\n\nReasoning:\n- From the text we directly have \"Alfred isn't hungry\" and \"Every monkey drank.\" So the conjunction \"Alfred isn't hungry and every monkey drank\" (statement 2) follows immediately from the premises.\n\n- Nothing in the premises forces whether Alfred drank or whether any particular monkey is hungry or whether Lewis (or Alfred) drank. The conditional \"If Lewis doesn't see Lewis, then a donkey saw Lewis\" only says a donkey would have seen Lewis in the hypothetical case Lewis doesn't see Lewis; it does not assert that Lewis doesn't see Lewis, so it does not force that any donkey actually saw Lewis beyond the separate premise that there is at least one donkey somewhere.\n\nCounterexamples (models satisfying all premises but falsifying the other options):\n1. To falsify \"Alfred didn't drink\" (statement 1): take a model with Alfred a monkey (so by \"every monkey drank\" Alfred drank), Alfred not hungry, Lewis hungry, and with at least one donkey elsewhere. This satisfies all premises but makes statement 1 false.\n\n3. To falsify \"A monkey is hungry and Alfred drank\": take a model where every monkey drank but no monkey is hungry, and Alfred did not drink (or did \u2014 either way you can make the conjunct false). This satisfies the premises but makes statement 3 false.\n\n4. To falsify \"Alfred and Lewis drank\": take a model where Alfred does not drink or Lewis does not drink (still satisfying the given facts); premises do not force either to drink, so 4 need not hold.\n\n5. To falsify \"A monkey is hungry but it is not the case that Alfred drank\": take a model with no hungry monkeys and with Alfred drinking (or with no hungry monkeys and Alfred drinking or not drinking to negate the conjunction); premises allow such a model, so 5 need not hold.\n\n6. To falsify \"Alfred drank\": take Alfred to be a human (humans are allowed and need not drink), Alfred not hungry, Lewis hungry, monkeys (others) all drank; this satisfies premises but Alfred did not drink, so 6 need not hold.\n\nThus only (2) is guaranteed true by the given information.",

(So \u2203d (Donkey(d) \u2227 \u00acChased(d,Alfred)).)\n- A human will run. (\u2203h (Human(h) \u2227 Run(h)).)\n- Every human saw Alfred. (\u2200h (Human(h) \u2192 Saw(h,Alfred)).)\n- (If every monkey chased Lewis then not all monkeys chased Lewis.) Logically this is equivalent to \u00ac(\u2200m (Monkey(m) \u2192 Chased(m,Lewis))), i.e. there is at least one monkey who did not chase Lewis.\n\nFrom \"there is at least one human\" (given by the domain condition) together with \"every human saw Alfred\", we get that a human saw Alfred (\u2203h (Human(h) \u2227 Saw(h,Alfred))). The statement \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is given directly. Therefore both sides of statement 4 (\"A human saw Alfred just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred\") are true in every model satisfying the premises, so the biconditional in 4 must hold.\n\nNone of the other statements are forced by the premises. For example:\n- Alfred won't run (1) is not forced: it's consistent with the premises that Alfred does run (make Alfred a human who runs).\n- Alfred and Lewis will run (2) and Lewis will run (3) are not forced: one can make Lewis a donkey or monkey who does not run.\n- The biconditional in 6 is stronger than 4 (it asserts \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" rather than \"not all donkeys chased Alfred\") and need not hold: one can have some donkey(s) chase Alfred and some not, so left side true while \"no donkeys chased Alfred\" is false.\n\nThus only (4) is necessarily true.",

      "raw_response": "Answer: Only statement 5 must be true.\n\nReasoning (short, explicit):\n\n- Let P be \"some monkey kicked Hazel\". The sentence \"A monkey kicked Hazel only if every donkey saw Hazel\" is P -> (every donkey saw Hazel). Contraposition gives (not every donkey saw Hazel) -> (not P), i.e. if not all donkeys saw Hazel then no monkey kicked Hazel.\n\n- We are given \"Not all donkeys saw Hazel\" as a fact. By the contraposition above, it follows that no monkey kicked Hazel. That is exactly statement 5, so 5 must be true.\n\n- Because 5 is true, statements 2 (\"A monkey kicked Hazel\") and 3 (\"Every monkey kicked Hazel\") must be false in every model, so they cannot be required true. The other statements (1, 4, 6) are not forced by the premises: one can give a concrete model satisfying all premises in which each of 1, 4, and 6 is false (for example, have a single donkey who did not see Hazel, a single monkey who kicked Alfred but not Hazel, make Hazel not hungry and Alfred not eat, etc.).

It is consistent with the premises that no human chases any donkey, so (3) need not be true. (Counterexample: take some donkeys that chase all humans, monkeys that chase some donkeys, and have no humans chase anything.)\n\n- (5) \"Hazel chased every donkey\": likewise not entailed; Hazel may chase none of the donkeys.\n\n- (1) \"Every human is asleep iff not all humans are asleep\": with at least one human this biconditional is impossible (it asserts P \u2194 \u00acP for P = \u201cevery human is asleep\u201d), so it is not forced by the premises.\n\nThus only statement 2 must be true.",

(This is extra information but not asked.)\n\n- (B) and (D) are explicitly given, so \"not all donkeys will run and not all humans will run\" (statement 6) is necessarily true in every situation satisfying the premises.\n\n- Each of the other statements is not forced by the premises:\n  - 1 and 3 assert \"every donkey will run\", which contradicts (B), so they cannot be true.\n  - 2 asserts \"no humans will run\" (all humans don't run) but the premises only give that at least one human does not run, so",

So (6) is necessarily true.\n- The same premise makes (1), (2), (3), and (5) false: (1) denies that any human is chased by all humans, but by the premise every human is chased by all humans; (2) and (3) deny humans chasing humans or mutual chasing, both contradicted by \"every human chased every human\"; (5) denies that any human chased every human, also contradicted.\n- (4) (\"Alfred is a donkey\") does not follow. The conditional \"If Lewis chased Lewis, then Alfred isn't a human\" does not force Alfred to be a donkey (Alfred could be human if Lewis does not chase Lewis). A concrete model shows this: let Alfred be a human, let Lewis be a monkey who does not chase himself, and let a donkey exist that Alfred (the human) chases and the monkey Lewis chases Alfred \u2014 this satisfies all givens while Alfred is human.\n\nThus only statement 6 must hold.",

For 3, one can build a model satisfying the premises in which Alfred does not see Lewis, every monkey chased Hazel, but some monkey did not see Lewis \u2014 that makes the conditional in 3 false. For 5, the biconditional between \"Alfred didn't chase Hazel\" and \"no monkeys saw Lewis\" is not enforced by the premises; suitable models can make either side true or false independently.\n\nThus only (1) is guaranteed true.",

      "raw_response": "Answer: Only statement 2 must be true.\n\nReasoning:\n\nFormalize the relevant premises (informally):\n- There is at least one human, one monkey, one donkey.\n- Every human saw every monkey that saw that human. (\u2200h[Human(h) \u2192 \u2200m[Monkey(m) \u2227 saw(m,h) \u2192 saw(h,m)]])\n- There exists a human who will run (so at least one human exists).\n- Every human saw Alfred. (\u2200h[Human(h) \u2192 saw(h, Alfred)])\n\nFrom the universal premise \"every human saw every monkey that saw it\" we immediately get that there exists a human with that property (because there is at least one human). So statement 2 (\"A human saw every monkey that saw it\") is logically entailed.\n\nThe other statements need not hold; here are countermodels showing they are not forced by the premises:\n\n- To show 1 (\"No humans saw every monkey\") need not be true: take a model where some human sees all monkeys. This satisfies the premises, so 1 can be false.\n\n- To show 3,4,5,6 need not be true: take a model with one human h, one monkey m, one donkey d, let Alfred = d, and let the only \"saw\" fact be saw(h, Alfred). Make no monkey see any human and no human see any monkey. Then:\n  - The universal premise about \"if a monkey saw a human then the human saw the monkey\" holds vacuously.\n  - Every human saw Alfred holds.\n  - There is a human who will run.\n  But no human saw any monkey, so statements 3,4,5,6 are false in this model.\n\nTherefore only statement 2 must be true in all situations satisfying the premises.",

The premises are\n\n- P1: \u2200x (D(x) \u2192 \u2200y (M(y) \u2192 C(x,y))).  (Every donkey chased every monkey.)\n- P2: \u2203m\u2203h\u2203d (M(m) \u2227 H(h) \u2227 D(d) \u2227 C(m,h) \u2227 C(h,d)).  (A monkey chased a human who chased a donkey.)\n- P3 (irrelevant to the six statements): If any monkey chased Hazel then Alfred is asleep.\n\nFrom P1 we immediately get statement 5: \u2200x (D(x) \u2192 \u2203y (M(y) \u2227 C(x,y))) \u2014 since if every donkey chases every monkey, in particular each donkey chases at least one monkey. Thus 5 must be true.\n\nThe others do not follow (or contradict P1):\n\n- 1 (\"There is a donkey that every monkey chased\"): not entailed. P1 talks about donkeys chasing monkeys, not monkeys chasing donkeys. A countermodel: D={d1}, M={m1,m2}, H={h1}; set C(d1,m1), C(d1,m2) to satisfy P1, and set C(m1,h1) and C(h1,d1) to satisfy P2, but set no monkey to chase any donkey. Then no donkey is chased by every monkey, so 1 can be false.\n\n- 2 (\"Every monkey chased every donkey\"): not entailed for the same reason; monkeys need not chase donkeys in any model of the premises.\n\n- 3 (\"No donkeys chased every monkey\"): contradicts P1 (P1 says every donkey chased every monkey), so 3 is false in every model of the premises.\n\n- 4 (\"There is not a donkey that every monkey chased\"): equivalent to the negation of 1, so likewise not entailed \u2014 one can build models where some donkey is chased by all monkeys (so 4 can be false) and models where none is (so 4 can be true).\n\n- 6 (\"No donkeys chased a monkey\"): contradicts P1 and so is false.\n\nTherefore the only statement that must be true is statement 5.",

You can satisfy all premises while having no donkey chase Alfred and Lewis chase Lewis (for instance, let Lewis be a human who chases himself, and ensure every donkey does not chase Alfred), so these conditionals need not hold.\n\nHence only statement 4 must be true.",

One can build a model with two humans H1,H2 and a donkey D that kicked only H1 (and H1 kicked D), so 1 and 4 fail.\n- 3 (\"No donkeys kicked every human\"): this need not hold because a donkey could indeed kick every human (e.g. a donkey D that kicks all humans and at least one of those humans kicks D back), so 3 is not forced.\n- 5 (\"There is a donkey that every human kicked\"): the premise gives for each donkey some human who kicked it, not that every human kicked the same donkey; a model can be made where different humans kick different donkeys, so 5 need not hold.\n\nThus only statement 6 must be true.",

Since there is at least one donkey, it follows that not all donkeys kicked Hazel. So statement 4 is necessarily true.\n\nWhy the others need not hold\n1. \"Every donkey kicked Hazel.\" Contradicted by the premise \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\", so it cannot be true.\n\n5. \"A donkey kicked Hazel.\" Also contradicted by \"No donkeys kicked Hazel\", so it cannot be true.\n\n2. \"Hazel kicked every donkey.\" Nothing in the premises says Hazel kicked anyone. A countermodel: some donkey d, human h (Hazel), monkey m with kicked(d,m) satisfies the premises but Hazel does not kick d. So 2 need not hold.\n\n6. \"Hazel kicked a donkey.\" Same as 2: not implied; there are models satisfying the premises where Hazel does not kick any donkey.\n\n3. \"Alfred is happy.\" Not forced. Alfred might not be human, or even if Alfred is human his happiness depends on whether any donkey chased Alfred \u2014 that is not fixed by the premises. One can build a model where a donkey did chase Alfred (so no human is happy) and a model where no donkey chased Alfred (so all humans are happy). Thus Alfred's happiness is not entailed.\n\nConclusion: only statement 4 must be true.",

      "raw_response": "Only statement 5 must be true.\n\nReasoning (short):\n\n- From the premises we have (A) every monkey ate, and (B) Hazel saw Alfred, and (C) Hazel did not see Hazel, and (D) Lewis is hungry, plus there is at least one donkey, one human and one monkey. Statement 5 (\"Every monkey ate and Hazel saw Alfred\") is exactly (A) \u2227 (B), so it is entailed.\n\n- 1 is false because it asserts \u00ac(Hazel saw Alfred), which contradicts (B).\n\n- 2 and 6 are the same claim: (\u2203x (Monkey(x) \u2227 Saw(x,Alfred))) \u2192 Ate(Hazel). This need not hold: e.g. take Hazel to be a human who did not eat and let some monkey have seen Alfred; the antecedent can be true while Ate(Hazel) is false. So they are not entailed.\n\n- 3 (\"Not all monkeys ate \u21d4 Alfred doesn't see Hazel\") is false because the left side is false (every monkey ate), while the right side (whether Alfred sees Hazel) is independent of the premises.\n\n- 4 (\"Alfred doesn't see Hazel \u21d4 a monkey ate\") is false because the right side is true (there is at least one monkey and every monkey ate) but the left side is not forced by the premises.\n\nThus only statement 5 must be true.",
