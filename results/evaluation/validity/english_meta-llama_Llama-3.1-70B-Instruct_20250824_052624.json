Hazel is a human.\n3. No donkeys saw Lewis and no donkeys saw Hazel.\n4. Every monkey chased Lewis only if not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n5. If a human chased Lewis, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that no donkeys saw Lewis or Hazel. However, this does not provide information about whether donkeys saw other humans.\n\nStatement 4 is a bit tricky, but it implies that if all monkeys chased Lewis, then no monkey chased Lewis. This is a contradictory situation, so it's more likely that not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n\nStatement 5 is also complex, but it implies that if a human (other than Hazel) chased Lewis, then every monkey would chase Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase herself. Since Hazel can't chase herself (as it's not mentioned anywhere), this statement is more about the condition for monkeys chasing Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n1. A donkey saw a human: This is possible but not necessarily true, as we don't have information about donkeys seeing other humans.\n2. No donkeys saw a human: This is not necessarily true, as we only know that no donkeys saw Lewis and Hazel, but not other humans.\n3. A donkey saw every human: This is not necessarily true, as we don't have information about donkeys seeing all humans.\n4. Every donkey saw a human: This is not necessarily true, as we don't have information about all donkeys seeing any human.\n5. Every donkey saw every human: This is not necessarily true, as we don't have information about all donkeys seeing all humans.\n6. No donkeys saw every human: This statement is true. We know that no donkeys saw Lewis and Hazel, and there's no information that suggests all donkeys saw all other humans.\n\nFinal answer: Statement 6, \"No donkeys saw every human,\" must be true in this situation.",

No monkeys kicked Hazel.\n3. A monkey kicked a donkey that kicked a donkey.\n4. Every human is happy.\n5. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know Lewis isn't a donkey. Since Lewis can be either a human or a monkey (exclusively), and every human is happy (statement 4), if Lewis is a human, then Lewis is happy. However, if Lewis is a monkey, we don't have enough information to determine his happiness. But since statement 1 says there's at least one human, and we don't know if Lewis is a human or a monkey, we can't be certain about Lewis's happiness. So, statement 1 (\"Lewis is happy\") is not necessarily true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know no monkeys kicked Hazel. This directly contradicts statements 3 (\"A monkey kicked Hazel\") and 4 (\"Every monkey kicked Hazel\"), so statements 3 and 4 are false.\n\nStatement 5 (\"Not all monkeys kicked Hazel\") is true because we know no monkeys kicked Hazel (statement 2).\n\nStatement 6 (\"Hazel kicked every monkey\") is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to determine if Hazel kicked any monkeys.\n\nIn conclusion, the statements that must be true in this situation are:\n\n- 5.

Not all donkeys ate.\n3. No donkeys kicked Hazel.\n4. Lewis isn't a donkey.\n5. A monkey kicked Hazel unless not all donkeys will run.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel. This immediately eliminates statements 3 and 4 as possibilities, since they contradict the given information.\n\nStatement 5 is also eliminated because it is not a must-be-true statement; it's a conditional statement that depends on the behavior of the donkeys.\n\nNow, let's analyze the remaining statements:\n\n1. Hazel kicked a donkey: We don't have any information about Hazel kicking a donkey, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n2. Lewis will run: We don't have any information about Lewis's behavior, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n5. Not all donkeys kicked Hazel: This statement is true because we know that no donkeys kicked Hazel (from statement 3).\n6. Hazel kicked every donkey: We don't have any information about Hazel kicking every donkey, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nHowever, statement 5 is a bit tricky. The correct interpretation is that it's indeed true that not all donkeys kicked Hazel, but this is because no donkeys kicked Hazel. A more accurate interpretation of the options would be to look for a statement that is universally true regardless of the specifics of the situation.\n\nConsidering the given information again, we can see that statement 5 is indeed true, but it's not the only option that must be true. Since no donkeys kicked Hazel, and everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey, it must be the case that a monkey kicked Hazel, unless not all donkeys will run. However, we don't have enough information to determine if all donkeys will run or not. \n\nBut we do know that Lewis isn't a donkey, and there's at least one of each type. This means Lewis must be either a human or a monkey. However, we can't determine if Lewis will run or not.\n\nHowever, we can determine that statement 1 is not necessarily true, and statement 6 is not necessarily true.\n\nStatement 2 is tricky. If Lewis isn't a donkey, and there's at least one of each type, then Lewis must be either a human or a monkey. However, we don't have any information about humans or monkeys running. But we do know that not all donkeys ate, and there's no information that links eating to running. However, we do know that a monkey kicked Hazel unless not all donkeys will run. This implies that if a monkey kicked Hazel, then it must be the case that not all donkeys will run, or else the condition wouldn't be necessary. However, we can't determine if a monkey kicked Hazel or not, because we don't know if all donkeys will run or not.\n\nHowever, we can determine that statement 2 is not necessarily true.\n\nHowever, we can determine that statement 5 is indeed true.\n\nFinal Answer: The correct answer is statement 5: Not all donkeys kicked Hazel.",

However, we have already concluded that if every monkey chased Hazel, then no humans are hungry and not all donkeys drank.

A human is happy and a monkey is happy.\n3. No humans chased Hazel only if not all humans chased Lewis.\n4. Not all donkeys chased Alfred and only donkeys ate.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that only donkeys ate. This implies that if Alfred ate, then Alfred must be a donkey.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Alfred ate: This statement is not necessarily true. Alfred could be a human or a monkey, in which case he wouldn't have eaten.\n\n2. A human is happy just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to establish a direct relationship between a human's happiness and the donkeys chasing Alfred.\n\n3. Alfred didn't eat: This statement is not necessarily true. As mentioned earlier, if Alfred is a donkey, then he could have eaten.\n\n4. Alfred and Hazel ate: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information about Hazel's species or eating habits.\n\n5. Alfred and Lewis ate: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information about Lewis's species or eating habits.\n\n6. A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to establish a direct relationship between a human's happiness and the donkeys chasing Alfred.\n\nHowever, we can deduce one thing: If Alfred is a donkey, then he must have eaten, because only donkeys ate. But we cannot confirm that Alfred is a donkey. \n\nBut we can confirm that if Alfred is not a donkey, then he didn't eat. And if Alfred is a donkey, then he ate. So, we can say that Alfred ate if and only if Alfred is a donkey.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 3 again: Not all donkeys chased Alfred. This statement implies that there is at least one donkey that didn't chase Alfred. But it doesn't imply that Alfred is a donkey. However, if Alfred is a donkey, then not all donkeys chased Alfred, because a donkey (Alfred) didn't chase himself.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2 again: A human is happy and a monkey is happy. This statement implies that at least one human is happy. Now, let's look at statement 3 again: No humans chased Hazel only if not all humans chased Lewis. This statement implies that if all humans chased Lewis, then at least one human chased Hazel. But we don't know if all humans chased Lewis. However, if all humans chased Lewis, then at least one human is unhappy (because he chased Lewis), which contradicts the statement that a human is happy. Therefore, not all humans chased Lewis.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 3 again: No humans chased Hazel only if not all humans chased Lewis. This statement implies that no humans chased Hazel, because not all humans chased Lewis.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 6 again: A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred. If no donkeys chased Alfred, then Alfred is not a donkey (because only donkeys ate, and if Alfred is not a donkey, then he didn't eat). But we don't know if Alfred is a donkey or not. However, if Alfred is a donkey, then at least one donkey didn't chase Alfred (Alfred himself). But if Alfred is not a donkey, then no donkeys chased Alfred. In both cases, we can say that a human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n6. A human is happy just in case no donkeys chased Alfred.",

Since Lewis is happy, it's possible that Lewis is not the one who was kicked. \n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n1.

A monkey kicked every monkey that kicked it: This statement is a bit tricky, but since no monkeys kicked a monkey (statement 3), there are no monkeys that kicked another monkey to begin with. Therefore, this statement is technically true but doesn't provide any useful information.\n\n5. Every monkey kicked a monkey: This statement contradicts statement 3, so it cannot be true.\n\n6. There is a monkey that every monkey kicked: This statement also contradicts statement 3, so it cannot be true.\n\nHowever, we have to consider the possibility that statement 3 is not absolute and is contradicted by statement 4.

If we consider the spirit of the question and the apparent contradiction between statements 3 and 4, we can conclude that none of the statements must be true in this situation.\n\nFinal answer: None of the statements must be true in this situation, but if I had to choose one, it would be:\n\n4.

This means Alfred cannot be a monkey (since a monkey kicked him), and Alfred cannot be a donkey (since a monkey kicked him, and donkeys can only be kicked by other donkeys according to statement 4). Therefore, Alfred must be a human.\n\nStatement 4 says \"only donkeys drank or every donkey kicked Lewis.\" Since Alfred is a human and was kicked by a monkey, he didn't drink (because only donkeys drank in the first case, and he's not a donkey). Therefore, statement 1 \"Alfred didn't drink\" must be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the other options:\n\n- Statement 2 \"Alfred and Hazel drank\" cannot be true because we already established Alfred didn't drink.\n- Statement 3 \"Alfred and Lewis drank\" cannot be true because Alfred didn't drink.\n- Statement 4 \"A monkey is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred\" is true based on the given information, but we're looking for statements that \"must be true\" based on the other options provided.\n- Statement 5 \"Alfred drank\" is false because we established Alfred didn't drink.\n- Statement 6 \"Alfred is happy and a monkey kicked Alfred\" cannot be confirmed because we don't know if Alfred is happy or not.\n\nTherefore, the statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n1.

Not all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. According to the given information, a human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel, and every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel. However, it does not imply that not all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\n\n5.

If every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel only if Hazel didn't chase Hazel.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The given information does not provide any direct connection between Hazel chasing Hazel and monkeys chasing Hazel.\n\nHowever, we can derive a connection between statements 3 and 4 from the given information. Since every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel, and a human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel, we can conclude that:\n\nIf every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nNow, let's re-examine statement 4:\nNot all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nWe can rewrite this statement as:\nEvery monkey chased Hazel if and only if not all humans are asleep.\n\nSince we know that if every human is asleep, then every monkey chased Hazel, we can conclude that:\nNot all humans are asleep if every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude the converse, i.e., every monkey chased Hazel if not all humans are asleep.\n\nBut we can conclude that:\nNot all humans are asleep if every monkey chased Hazel, and every monkey chased Hazel if every human is asleep.\n\nThis is equivalent to:\nNot all humans are asleep if and only if every monkey chased Hazel, given that every human is asleep if every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nHowever, this is still not the same as statement 4.\n\nNow, let's re-examine statement 1:\nA human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nWe can rewrite this statement as:\nEvery monkey chased Hazel if and only if a human is asleep.\n\nSince we know that every monkey chased Hazel just in case every human chased Hazel, and a human is asleep just in case every human chased Hazel, we can conclude that:\nEvery monkey chased Hazel if and only if a human is asleep.\n\nThis is equivalent to statement 1, but with a different condition.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that:\nEvery human is asleep just in case every monkey chased Hazel.\n\nThis is equivalent to statement 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n5.

However, we can't rule it out entirely.\n\n3. Every donkey chased every human: Similar to statement 1, there is no information to support this, and statement 2 contradicts it.\n\n4. No donkeys chased every human: This statement is not necessarily true. We can't confirm that no donkeys chased every human, as there is no direct information about donkeys chasing humans.\n\n6. A donkey chased every human: This statement is also not necessarily true, as there is no information to support it, and statement 2 contradicts it.\n\nHowever, we can confirm that statement 5 \"A human chased a donkey\" must be true based on the given information.\n\nFinal answer: Statement 5, \"A human chased a donkey.\"",

This directly supports statement 5: \"A human chased Alfred.\" \n\nStatement 2 tells us that a monkey chased a human that chased a human. This implies that there are at least two humans (one chasing the other). Since every human chased Alfred (statement 4), it's possible that Alfred is a human, but it's not a must. However, if Alfred is not a human, then he must be either a monkey or a donkey.\n\nStatement 1 tells us that everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey. If Alfred is a monkey, then he would be chasing himself (since every human chased Alfred), which contradicts the fact that a monkey chased a human that chased a human. Therefore, Alfred cannot be a monkey.\n\nIf Alfred is a donkey, then statement 4 (every human chased Alfred) still holds true, but it doesn't provide any information about Alfred's nature.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Alfred chased a human: This is not necessarily true. Alfred could be a donkey or a human, and we don't have enough information to confirm this.\n2.

Lewis saw a monkey.\n3. Every monkey saw Lewis.\n4. Lewis saw every monkey.\n5. A monkey saw Lewis.\n6. Not all monkeys saw Lewis.\n",
      "model_response": "To solve this problem, let's break down the given information:\n\n1. Everything is a donkey, a human, or a monkey (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all donkeys saw Lewis.\n3. A donkey saw a monkey that saw it.\n4. A human is happy if and only if a human saw Hazel.\n5. Lewis isn't hungry and Hazel is a monkey.\n6. No humans will attack but it is not the case that Lewis doesn't see Hazel.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know Hazel is a monkey. From statement 6, we know Lewis sees Hazel. Since Hazel is a monkey, this means Lewis sees a monkey.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n1. No monkeys saw Lewis: This is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n2. Lewis saw a monkey: This must be true, as we know Lewis sees Hazel, who is a monkey.\n3. Every monkey saw Lewis: This is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n4. Lewis saw every monkey: This is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n5. A monkey saw Lewis: This is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm this, but we do know Lewis sees a monkey.\n6. Not all monkeys saw Lewis: This is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm this.\n\nHowever, we can deduce that statement 5 is true indirectly. If a donkey saw a monkey that saw it (statement 3), and Lewis sees a monkey (Hazel), it's possible that the monkey that saw the donkey is not the same monkey (Hazel) that Lewis sees. But we also know that Lewis sees Hazel, and there's no information that says Lewis is a donkey. So, if Lewis is a human, then a human (Lewis) sees a monkey (Hazel), and since a human is happy if and only if a human saw Hazel, then Lewis must be happy. But we don't have any information about Lewis being happy or not. However, we do know that Lewis isn't hungry, and this doesn't provide any information about Lewis seeing or being seen by a monkey. But we do know that a donkey saw a monkey that saw it, and it's possible that this monkey is not Hazel, and this monkey saw Lewis.\n\nHowever, we can deduce that statement 5 is true. If a donkey saw a monkey that saw it, and this monkey is not Hazel, then this monkey saw Lewis, because if this monkey didn't see Lewis, then the only monkey that Lewis sees is Hazel, and we don't have any information that says Hazel saw the donkey. But we do know that a donkey saw a monkey that saw it, so this monkey must have seen Lewis.\n\nSo, the statements that must be true are:\n\n2. Lewis saw a monkey.\n5. A monkey saw Lewis.\n\nHowever, the question asks which of the statements \"must be true\", and since statement 2 is a direct consequence of the given information, and statement 5 is an indirect consequence, the best answer is:\n\n2. Lewis saw a monkey.",

There is not a donkey that every donkey chased.\n3. Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\n4. Not all monkeys will run but it is not the case that Hazel didn't chase Alfred.\n\nFrom statement 4, we can infer that Hazel chased Alfred. Since Hazel and Alfred can be either a donkey, human, or monkey, we have a few possibilities:\n\n- If Hazel is a monkey and Alfred is a human, then a monkey chased a human.\n- If Hazel is a donkey and Alfred is a human, then a donkey chased a human.\n- If Hazel is a monkey and Alfred is a monkey, then a monkey chased a monkey (this doesn't provide any information about donkeys or humans).\n- If Hazel is a donkey and Alfred is a monkey, then a donkey chased a monkey (this doesn't provide any information about donkeys chasing humans).\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. A donkey chased a human: This might be true (if Hazel is a donkey and Alfred is a human), but it's not necessarily true (if Hazel and Alfred are both monkeys, or Hazel is a monkey and Alfred is a human).\n\n2. A donkey chased every human: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm that every human was chased by a donkey.\n\n3. Every donkey chased a human: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm that every donkey chased a human.\n\n4. Every donkey chased every human: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm that every donkey chased every human.\n\n5. No donkeys chased every human: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm that no donkeys chased every human.\n\n6. No donkeys chased a human: This statement is not necessarily true. We have a possibility that a donkey (Hazel) chased a human (Alfred).\n\nHowever, we can make a conclusion based on statement 3: \"Every donkey chased every donkey that chased every human.\" If there is a donkey that chased every human, then every donkey must have chased that donkey (by statement 3). But we know that there is not a donkey that every donkey chased (statement 2). Therefore, there cannot be a donkey that chased every human.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n5.

If every monkey chased Lewis, then not all monkeys chased Lewis.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. Alfred won't run: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to conclude that Alfred won't run.\n\n2. Alfred and Lewis will run: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to conclude that both Alfred and Lewis will run.\n\n3. Lewis will run: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to conclude that Lewis will run.\n\n4. A human saw Alfred just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred: This statement is not necessarily true. We know that every human saw Alfred, but we don't know if this is related to whether or not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n\n5. Alfred will run: This statement is not necessarily true.

We know that every human saw Alfred, but we don't know if this is related to whether or not donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nHowever, we can deduce some information from the given statements. Since every human saw Alfred and a human will run, if Alfred is a human, then Alfred will run. But we can't conclude this for certain because Alfred could be a donkey or a monkey.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 4 again: \"If every monkey chased Lewis, then not all monkeys chased Lewis.\" This statement implies that not all monkeys can chase Lewis, because if they did, then the statement would be false. Therefore, Lewis cannot be a monkey, because if Lewis were a monkey, then it would be possible for all monkeys to chase Lewis, which would make the statement false.\n\nSince Lewis cannot be a monkey, Lewis must be either a human or a donkey. If Lewis is a human, then Lewis will run. If Lewis is a donkey, we don't have enough information to conclude that Lewis will run.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that statement 3 \"Lewis will run\" is not necessarily true, but it is possible. But we can conclude that statement 3 is more likely to be true than the other options.\n\nBut there is one statement that must be true. Since every human saw Alfred, and there is at least one human, then at least one human saw Alfred. And since not all donkeys chased Alfred, then it is possible that no donkeys chased Alfred. Therefore, statement 6 \"A human saw Alfred if and only if no donkeys chased Alfred\" is not necessarily true, but a part of it is. A human saw Alfred. And this is true regardless of whether or not donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nHowever, statement 4 \"A human saw Alfred just in case not all donkeys chased Alfred\" is not necessarily true, but a part of it is. A human saw Alfred. And this is true regardless of whether or not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nBut statement 4 can be rephrased as \"A human saw Alfred if not all donkeys chased Alfred\". This statement is true, because a human saw Alfred regardless of whether or not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n\nHowever, statement 4 can also be rephrased as \"If a human saw Alfred, then not all donkeys chased Alfred\". This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nHowever, statement 4 can also be rephrased as \"A human saw Alfred if and only if not all donkeys chased Alfred is not true\".

Since only humans are hungry (statement 3), this implies Lewis is a human.\n\nStatement 6: Alfred and Hazel are hungry.\nWe already know Alfred isn't hungry, so this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n3.

It is not the case that Hazel saw Hazel (this implies Hazel is not a monkey, as a monkey could see itself in a mirror or reflection, but it's more likely that Hazel is a human and the statement is referring to the fact that a person can't see themselves without a reflective surface).\n5.

However, it implies that if Lewis were to chase someone (which would be possible), it would affect the happiness of the donkeys.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n1. Lewis will attack: This is possible but not necessarily true, as the statement \"a human will attack\" doesn't specifically say it's Lewis.\n2.

Since there's at least one donkey, and not all donkeys will run (statement 3), it's possible that the donkeys that are asleep won't run.\n\nStatement 2 implies that if no humans are asleep, then Hazel didn't chase Lewis.

But we can't conclude that Hazel didn't chase Lewis because we don't know if Hazel is a human or a donkey.\n\nStatement 3 says it's not the case that Hazel didn't chase Hazel. This implies that Hazel did chase Hazel, which means Hazel must be a donkey (since a donkey can chase itself, but a human or monkey can't chase themselves in this context).\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. Not all humans will run and every donkey will run. This is not necessarily true because we know not all donkeys will run.\n\n2. Not all donkeys will run and no humans will run.

Also, since Hazel saw Hazel, it's possible that Hazel is a monkey and saw itself. In this case, if there's another monkey, then that monkey must have chased Hazel (the monkey) because every monkey chased every monkey that chased it (statement 2). If there's no other monkey, then the statement \"a monkey kicked Alfred\" implies that the monkey (Hazel) must have kicked Alfred, and since every monkey chased every monkey that chased it, Hazel (the monkey) must have chased itself.\n\n6. A monkey chased every monkey that chased it: This statement is already given in the problem (statement 2), so it's true by definition.\n\nHowever, the question asks which of the given statements \"must be true in this situation.\" Based on the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- 5.

Every monkey kicked every monkey.\n3. No humans ate just in case not all donkeys drank.\n4. Not all donkeys drank if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that monkeys are not relevant to the outcome of the problem, as they only interact with each other.\n\nFrom statement 3, we can infer that if all donkeys drank, then humans can eat. However, if not all donkeys drank, then no humans ate.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that not all donkeys drank if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis. This means that if all humans kicked Lewis, then all donkeys drank.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. Lewis drank: We cannot conclude this with certainty, as Lewis could be a human or a monkey, and we don't have enough information about their drinking habits.\n\n2.

Therefore, if no humans ate, then not all humans kicked Lewis.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the options:\n\n2. No humans ate if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis: This statement is still not necessarily true, but we can conclude that \"No humans ate if not all humans kicked Lewis\" is true.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that:\n\n\"If no humans ate, then not all humans kicked Lewis\" is equivalent to \"If all humans kicked Lewis, then humans ate\". \n\nBut we can also conclude that \"If all humans kicked Lewis, then all donkeys drank\" (from statement 4). And from statement 3, \"If all donkeys drank, then humans can eat\". \n\nSo, \"If all humans kicked Lewis, then humans can eat\" is true. And \"If no humans ate, then not all humans kicked Lewis\" is true.\n\nSo, \"No humans ate if and only if not all humans kicked Lewis\" is actually true.\n\nThe final answer is: 2.",

Since Hazel didn't chase Alfred, and not all donkeys chased Alfred, it's possible that Hazel is a human or a monkey.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. Hazel saw a donkey: This is possible but not necessarily true. If Hazel is a human or a monkey, she might not have seen a donkey.\n\n2. A donkey saw Hazel: This is possible but not necessarily true. If Hazel is a human or a monkey, a donkey might not have seen her.\n\n3. Every donkey saw Hazel: This is not necessarily true.

There is not a human that every human chased.\n   - This statement is false because, according to the given information, every human chased every human.

However, if Lewis is a human and chased Lewis, then Lewis is a human that every human chased, but Lewis also chased Lewis, so Lewis is a human that chased a human that every human chased.

No humans are asleep only if Hazel didn't chase Lewis.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that every monkey chased Alfred.

If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Not all monkeys chased Hazel.\n- This statement must be true because we know that no monkeys chased Hazel (statement 2).\n\n2. Hazel chased every monkey.\n- We cannot confirm this statement as true. There is no information that suggests Hazel chased every monkey.\n\n3. Hazel chased a monkey.\n- We cannot confirm this statement as true.

There is no information that suggests Alfred is a donkey.\n\nHowever, we can deduce that statement 1 \"Not all monkeys chased Hazel\" is indeed true, but that's because of the given statement that \"No monkeys chased Hazel\". But if we consider the given statement \"A monkey chased a monkey that chased a human\", we can infer that there is at least one monkey that didn't chase Hazel (the one that was chased by another monkey), so statement 1 is indeed true.\n\nBut there is another statement that must be true. If Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel. If Lewis is not a donkey, then Lewis is either a human or a monkey. If Lewis is a human, then a human saw Hazel (Lewis), and a human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel, so Lewis saw Hazel. If Lewis is a monkey, then a monkey saw Hazel (Lewis), but we know that no monkeys chased Hazel, so this doesn't contradict any statement. But if Lewis is a monkey, then a monkey chased a monkey that chased a human, and this monkey that was chased by another monkey didn't chase Hazel, so this monkey didn't see Hazel, so not every monkey saw Hazel. But if Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel only if every human saw Hazel, so if not every human saw Hazel, then not every monkey saw Hazel. But we know that a human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel, so if Lewis didn't see Hazel, then no human saw Hazel, so not every monkey saw Hazel. But we also know that a monkey chased a monkey that chased a human, so at least one monkey saw a human, so at least one monkey saw Hazel. So, if Lewis is a donkey, then every monkey saw Hazel. But we also know that no monkeys chased Hazel, so if every monkey saw Hazel, then every monkey must have seen Hazel without chasing her. But this is not possible because if a monkey saw Hazel without chasing her, then this monkey must have been chased by another monkey, but we know that a monkey chased a monkey that chased a human, so this monkey that was chased by another monkey must have chased a human, so this monkey must have seen a human, so this monkey must have seen Hazel while chasing a human, so this is a contradiction. So, Lewis cannot be a donkey. But if Lewis is not a donkey, then Lewis is either a human or a monkey. If Lewis is a human, then a human saw Hazel (Lewis), and a human saw Hazel just in case Lewis saw Hazel, so Lewis saw Hazel. If Lewis is a monkey, then a monkey saw Hazel (Lewis), but we know that no monkeys chased Hazel, so this doesn't contradict any statement. But we also know that if no donkeys chased Alfred, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis. So, if Lewis is a monkey, then Lewis didn't chase Lewis, so Lewis is not a monkey that chased a monkey that chased a human, so Lewis is not a monkey that chased a human, so Lewis is not a monkey that saw a human, so Lewis is not a monkey that saw Hazel. But we know that a monkey saw Hazel (Lewis), so this is a contradiction. So, Lewis cannot be a monkey. So, Lewis must be a human.

Alfred doesn't see Lewis unless only donkeys drank.\n4. If every monkey kicked Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis.\n5. A human saw Lewis and not all donkeys chased Alfred.\n6. Every monkey drank and a monkey kicked Alfred.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if a human kicks a donkey, the donkey will kick that human. However, it doesn't guarantee that every donkey kicked every human.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know a human saw Lewis. If every monkey kicked Lewis, then every monkey saw Lewis (statement 4). However, we don't have enough information to confirm that every monkey kicked Lewis. \n\nStatement 3 implies that if Alfred sees Lewis, then only donkeys drank. However, we don't have enough information to confirm that Alfred sees Lewis.\n\nStatement 6 tells us that every monkey drank and a monkey kicked Alfred. This doesn't provide direct information about the relationship between donkeys and humans.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n1. A donkey kicked every human: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm that every donkey kicked every human.\n\n2. No donkeys kicked a human: This statement is not necessarily true. If a human kicked a donkey, the donkey would kick that human (statement 2).\n\n3.

Every donkey kicked every human: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm that every donkey kicked every human.\n\n5. There is a donkey that every human kicked: This statement is not necessarily true. We don't have enough information to confirm that every human kicked a particular donkey.\n\n6. A donkey kicked a human: This statement is true. If a human kicked a donkey, the donkey would kick that human (statement 2). Since a human saw Lewis and not all donkeys chased Alfred, it's possible that a human kicked a donkey, and therefore, a donkey kicked a human.\n\nThe final answer is: Statements 3 and 6 must be true in this situation.",
