Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 2: Zindle is a tove.\n- We don't have direct information about Zindle's type. However, we know that not all toves galumphed over Zindle. This doesn't provide enough information to determine Zindle's type. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n- From the given information, \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" This implies that no toves galumphed over Bungo, which is a stronger statement than \"not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\" Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Bungo galumphed over every tove.\n- We don't have any information about Bungo's actions towards toves. The given information only states that no toves galumphed over Bungo, but it doesn't say anything about Bungo's actions.

A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"No toves chortled at Rafin.\"\n- This means that if an entity chortled at Rafin, it cannot be a tove.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\"\n- This means that if an entity is a borogove, it chortled at Zindle.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"No borogoves are mimsy only if every rath chortled at Rafin.\"\n- This can be interpreted as: If no borogoves are mimsy, then every rath chortled at Rafin.\n- The contrapositive of this statement is: If not every rath chortled at Rafin, then some borogoves are mimsy.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo.\"\n- This means that there exists at least one borogove that chortled at Rafin.\n- The second part, \"it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snacked Bungo,\" is a tautology (Bungo snicker-snacked Bungo).\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **Zindle chortled at a borogove.**\n   - We know that every borogove chortled at Zindle, but we don't have information about whether Zindle chortled at any borogove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Not all borogoves chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every borogove chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - We have no direct information about Zindle being mimsy or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **No borogoves chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This directly contradicts the given information that every borogove chortled at Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This is true because every borogove chortled at Zindle, which implies that at least one borogove chortled at Zindle.\n\n6. **Zindle chortled at every borogove.**\n   - We know that every borogove chortled at Zindle, but we don't have information about whether Zindle chortled at every borogove. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5. A borogove chortled at Zindle.**",

If not all toves will whiffle, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n5. Only borogoves will whiffle.\n6. A rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of Zindle and Bungo\n- Since everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and there's at least one of each, we need to determine what Zindle and Bungo are.\n- From statement 6, \"A rath galumphed over Zindle,\" we know that Zindle cannot be a rath (since a rath cannot galumph over itself).\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the whiffle condition\n- Statement 5 says, \"Only borogoves will whiffle.\" This means that if anyone whiffles, they must be a borogove.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the gyre condition\n- Statement 2 says, \"Zindle and Bungo gyred.\" This is a given fact.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the gimble condition\n- Statement 3 says, \"Not all toves gimbled.\" This means that at least one tove did not gimbled.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the galumph condition\n- Statement 4 says, \"If not all toves will whiffle, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\"\n  - We need to consider two cases:\n    1. **All toves will whiffle:** In this case, the conditional statement does not apply because the antecedent is false.\n    2. **Not all toves will whiffle:** In this case, the conditional statement applies. If Bungo galumphed over Zindle, then no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\n#### Step 6: Combine the conditions\n- From statement 6, \"A rath galumphed over Zindle,\" we know that Zindle cannot be a rath.\n- Since Zindle is not a rath, Zindle must be either a tove or a borogove.\n- If Zindle were a tove, then Zindle would not whiffle (because only borogoves will whiffle).\n- If Zindle were a borogove, then Zindle would whiffle.\n\n#### Step 7: Determine the type of Bungo\n- If Zindle is a borogove, then Zindle will whiffle.\n- If Zindle is a tove, then Zindle will not whiffle.\n- Since a rath galumphed over Zindle, and from statement 4, if Bungo galumphed over Zindle, then no raths galumphed over Bungo. This implies that Bungo cannot be a rath (because a rath cannot galumph over another rath).\n\n#### Step 8: Evaluate the options\n1. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle:** This is possible if both are borogoves.\n2. **Zindle won't whiffle:** This is possible if Zindle is a tove.\n3. **Zindle gyred and only borogoves will whiffle:** This is true regardless of whether Zindle is a tove or a borogove.\n4. **Zindle gyred and not all borogoves will whiffle:** This is not necessarily true because we don't have information about other borogoves.\n5. **Zindle gyred and no borogoves will whiffle:** This is false because only borogoves will whiffle.\n6. **Zindle will whiffle:** This is possible if Zindle is a borogove.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3.

Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle or a rath is beamish.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There are at least one tove, one borogove, and one rath.\n- Not all borogoves are uffish, so there is at least one borogove that is not uffish.\n- Rafin is uffish, so Rafin is a borogove.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the chortling relationships\n- A tove chortled at a tove that chortled at a rath.\n  - Let's denote the toves as \\( T_1 \\) and \\( T_2 \\), and the rath as \\( R \\).\n  - So, \\( T_1 \\) chortled at \\( T_2 \\), and \\( T_2 \\) chortled at \\( R \\).\n\n- No toves chortled at Bungo.\n  - This means Bungo is not a tove (since no toves chortled at Bungo, and toves can only chortle at other toves, borogoves, or raths).\n\n- Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle or a rath is beamish.\n  - If Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle, then either Bungo is not a tove (which we already know) or Zindle is not a tove.\n  - Alternatively, if a rath is beamish, then the statement is true regardless of Bungo's actions.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine Bungo's type\n- Since Bungo is not a tove, Bungo must be either a borogove or a rath.\n- If Bungo were a rath, then the statement \"Bungo didn't chortle at Zindle or a rath is beamish\" would always be true because a rath cannot chortle at anything (as per the given information).\n- Therefore, Bungo could be a rath, but we need to check if Bungo being a borogove leads to any contradictions.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the statements\n1. **Bungo chortled at every tove.**\n   - False.

Bungo did not chortle at Zindle, and there is no information suggesting Bungo chortled at any other tove.\n\n4. **Every tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - False. No toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n5. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - False.

Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Bungo's Type\n- Bungo is a rath.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Statement \"Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo\"\n- This statement is true and doesn't provide new information about other entities.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Statement \"A borogove will whiffle\"\n- This means that all borogoves will whiffle.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the Conditional Statement \"If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then Zindle will whiffle only if every rath is beamish\"\n- Let's denote:\n  - \\( P \\): Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.\n  - \\( Q \\): Zindle will whiffle.\n  - \\( R \\): Every rath is beamish.\n- The statement can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow (Q \\leftrightarrow R) \\).\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the Conditional Statement \"If Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if no borogoves are beamish\"\n- Since Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo, this statement is true.\n- Let's denote:\n  - \\( S \\): A borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n  - \\( T \\): No borogoves are beamish.\n- The statement can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow T \\).\n\n#### Step 6: Analyze the Statement \"Not all toves will whiffle\"\n- This means that there exists at least one tove that does not whiffle.\n\n### Determine the Truth of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then \\( P \\) is true.\n   - From \\( P \\rightarrow (Q \\leftrightarrow R) \\), we need to check if \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\) holds.\n   - We don't have enough information to determine \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) directly, so we cannot conclude this statement is true.\n\n2. **Bungo snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - Bungo is a rath, and the problem states that Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true because Bungo could have snicker-snacked another rath, but we don't have enough information to confirm this.\n\n3. **A rath snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - Bungo is a rath, so this statement would mean that Bungo snicker-snacked Bungo, which contradicts the given information.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Not all raths snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This is the negation of statement 1.\n   - Since we cannot confirm that every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, this statement must be true.\n\n5. **No raths snicker-snacked Bungo.**\n   - This is a stronger statement than statement 4.\n   - We don't have enough information to confirm that no raths snicker-snacked Bungo, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Bungo snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - Bungo is a rath, and the problem states that Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\n   - This statement is false because Bungo cannot snicker-snack itself.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**4. Not all raths snicker-snacked Bungo.**",

If Zindle gimbled, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if no toves gimbled.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **No raths chortled at a tove.**\n   - This means that for any rath \\( R \\) and any tove \\( T \\), \\( R \\) did not chortle at \\( T \\).\n\n2. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and no toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - The statement \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" implies that there is at least one tove that did not chortle at Bungo.\n   - The statement \"no toves chortled at Bungo\" implies that no tove chortled at Bungo.\n   - These two statements are contradictory unless we interpret \"not all toves chortled at Bungo\" as a redundant statement. Therefore, we can conclude that no toves chortled at Bungo.\n\n3. **If Zindle gimbled, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if no toves gimbled.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. If Zindle gimbled, then the condition \"every rath snicker-snacked Bungo\" is true only if \"no toves gimbled\" is true.\n   - This does not provide direct information about chortling, so we will focus on the other statements.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **Every tove chortled at a rath.**\n   - This would mean that for every tove \\( T \\), there exists at least one rath \\( R \\) such that \\( T \\) chortled at \\( R \\).\n   - We have no information to support this claim directly.\n\n2. **A tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - This would mean that there exists at least one tove \\( T \\) such that \\( T \\) chortled at every rath \\( R \\).\n   - We have no information to support this claim directly.\n\n3. **No raths chortled at every tove.**\n   - This is true because no raths chortled at any tove (from the given information).\n\n4. **No toves chortled at every rath.**\n   - This would mean that for every tove \\( T \\), there exists at least one rath \\( R \\) such that \\( T \\) did not chortle at \\( R \\).\n   - We have no information to support this claim directly.\n\n5. **Every tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - This would mean that for every tove \\( T \\) and every rath \\( R \\), \\( T \\) chortled at \\( R \\).\n   - We have no information to support this claim directly.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at a rath.**\n   - This would mean that there exists at least one tove \\( T \\) and at least one rath \\( R \\) such that \\( T \\) chortled at \\( R \\).\n   - We have no information to support this claim directly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively).\n2. There's at least one of each.\n3. No raths will burble.\n4. Rafin is a tove or a rath will burble.\n5. Not all toves will whiffle.\n6. Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of Bungo and Rafin\n- **Bungo** is explicitly stated to be a rath.\n- **Rafin** can be either a tove or a rath, based on the statement \"Rafin is a tove or a rath will burble.\"\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the implications of Bungo being a rath\n- Since Bungo is a rath, and no raths will burble, Bungo will not burble.\n- This means statement 3 (\"Bungo will burble\") is false.\n- Statement 5 (\"Bungo won't burble\") is true.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the implications of Rafin being a tove or a rath\n- If Rafin is a tove, then the statement \"Rafin is a tove or a rath will burble\" is true because Rafin is a tove.\n- If Rafin is a rath, then the statement \"Rafin is a tove or a rath will burble\" implies that a rath will burble, which contradicts the fact that no raths will burble. Therefore, Rafin cannot be a rath.\n- Hence, Rafin must be a tove.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the implications of Rafin being a tove\n- Since Rafin is a tove, we need to consider the statement \"Not all toves will whiffle.\"\n- This means that while some toves may whiffle, not all of them do. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Rafin will whiffle or not.\n- This means statements 4 (\"Rafin won't whiffle\") and 6 (\"Rafin will whiffle\") are both uncertain.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the implications for Bungo\n- Since Bungo is a rath and no raths will whiffle, Bungo will not whiffle.\n- This means statement 1 (\"Bungo will whiffle\") is false.\n- Statement 2 (\"Rafin and Bungo will whiffle\") is also false because Bungo will not whiffle.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n5. Bungo won't burble.",

The given rules do not specify that every borogove must galumph over a rath.\n\n2. **Every borogove galumphed over every rath.**\n   - This statement implies that for every borogove, it galumphed over all raths.\n   - This is even stronger than the first statement and is not supported by the given information.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle.\n3. Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle.\n4. A rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n5. Rafin isn't a tove.\n6. If no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then not all toves chortled at Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of Zindle and Rafin\n- From statement 2, Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle. This doesn't directly tell us Zindle's type but rules out the possibility that Zindle snicker-snacked itself.\n- From statement 3, Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle. This also doesn't directly tell us Rafin's type but rules out the possibility that Rafin galumphed over Zindle.\n- From statement 5, Rafin isn't a tove. Therefore, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the snicker-snacking\n- From statement 4, a rath snicker-snacked Zindle. This means there is at least one rath who snicker-snacked Zindle.\n- From statement 6, if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then not all toves chortled at Rafin. This implies that if no toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then there is at least one tove who did not chortle at Rafin.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the statements\n1. **Not all raths snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know that at least one rath snicker-snacked Zindle, but we don't have information about all raths. Therefore, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **No raths snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This contradicts statement 4, which states that a rath snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. **Zindle snicker-snacked every rath.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle's actions towards all raths. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n4. **Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - We know that at least one rath snicker-snacked Zindle, but we don't have information about all raths. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n5. **Zindle snicker-snacked a rath.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle's actions towards any rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true.\n\n6. **Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle and a rath snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This statement combines two pieces of information: Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle (from statement 2) and a rath snicker-snacked Zindle (from statement 4). Both parts of this statement are true. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

No toves galumphed over Zindle unless only toves gyred.\n5. A rath chortled at Zindle only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Zindle and Rafin gyred.\n- There is no direct information about Zindle or Rafin gyring. The information provided does not give us enough context to determine if Zindle and Rafin gyred. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Zindle gyred.\n- Similar to Statement 1, there is no direct information about Zindle gyring. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded as true.\n\n#### Statement 3: Not all raths are beamish.\n- According to the given information, every rath is beamish. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 4: Only raths are beamish.\n- The information states that every rath is beamish, but it does not provide any information about whether toves or borogoves can also be beamish. Therefore, we cannot conclude that only raths are beamish. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No raths are beamish.\n- The information explicitly states that every rath is beamish. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A rath is beamish.\n- The information explicitly states that every rath is beamish. Since there is at least one rath, it follows that a rath is beamish. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

If not all toves galumphed over Bungo, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin**:\n   - This means there is at least one rath that did not galumph over Rafin.\n\n2. **Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle**:\n   - This is a straightforward statement about Rafin's actions.\n\n3. **Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo**:\n   - This is another straightforward statement about Rafin's actions.\n\n4. **Every borogove chortled at Zindle**:\n   - This means all borogoves have chortled at Zindle.\n\n5. **No borogoves are beamish unless every borogove chortled at Bungo**:\n   - This implies that if there is at least one beamish borogove, then every borogove must have chortled at Bungo.\n\n6. **If not all toves galumphed over Bungo, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo**:\n   - This is a conditional statement. If not all toves galumphed over Bungo, then Zindle chortling at Zindle depends on whether every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **Bungo chortled at Bungo and not all raths galumphed over Rafin**:\n   - We know not all raths galumphed over Rafin, but we don't have information about Bungo chortling at Bungo. This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo**:\n   - Both parts of this statement are true based on the given conditions.

This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and every rath galumphed over Rafin**:\n   - We know not all raths galumphed over Rafin, so this statement is false because it contradicts the given condition.\n\n5. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo**:\n   - We know Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo, so this statement is false because it contradicts the given condition.\n\n6. **A rath galumphed over Rafin or not all raths chortled at Bungo**:\n   - We know not all raths galumphed over Rafin, so the first part of the disjunction is true.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Zindle chortled at every tove.\n3. A tove galumphed over Rafin only if a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n4. Not all toves will whiffle.\n5. No borogoves will burble.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - There is no information provided about Zindle whiffing. The only information about Zindle is that he chortles at every tove. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zindle will whiffle.\n   - **False.**\n\n2. **Not all toves chortled at Zindle.**\n   - The information states that Zindle chortled at every tove, but it does not say anything about toves chortling at Zindle. We cannot infer whether toves chortle at Zindle or not.\n   - **Cannot be determined.**\n\n3. **Every tove chortled at Zindle.**\n   - Similar to the previous statement, there is no information about toves chortling at Zindle. We cannot conclude that every tove chortled at Zindle.\n   - **Cannot be determined.**\n\n4. **A tove chortled at Zindle.**\n   - Again, there is no information about toves chortling at Zindle. We cannot conclude that any tove chortled at Zindle.\n   - **Cannot be determined.**\n\n5. **No toves chortled at Zindle.**\n   - There is no information about toves chortling at Zindle. We cannot conclude that no toves chortled at Zindle.\n   - **Cannot be determined.**\n\n6. **Zindle chortled at a tove.**\n   - The information states that Zindle chortled at every tove. Since there is at least one tove, it follows that Zindle chortled at a tove.\n   - **True.**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6.

Every rath snicker-snacked every borogove that snicker-snacked every rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The information given does not specify that every tove snicker-snacked a rath. It only states that every rath snicker-snacked every tove, which does not imply the reverse.\n\n#### Statement 2: A tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This statement could be true, but it is not guaranteed. The information given does not provide enough evidence to conclude that at least one tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n\n#### Statement 3: No toves snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The information given does not rule out the possibility that some toves might have snicker-snacked a rath.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n- This statement is not necessarily true.

The information given does not provide enough evidence to conclude that at least one tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n\n#### Statement 6: A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.\n- This statement is a contradiction. It cannot be true because it asserts both that a borogove will burble and that no borogoves will burble, which are mutually exclusive conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that can be definitively ruled out as false is Statement 6, due to its inherent contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**None of the statements must be true, except for the fact that Statement 6 is false.**",

Since Zindle is the object of the galumphing action by a rath, Zindle cannot be a rath (as the rath is the subject). However, we don't have enough information to determine whether Zindle is a tove or a borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **If Bungo isn't a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This statement is a tautology because it states that if Bungo is not a borogove, then Bungo is a borogove. This is always true by definition. However, it doesn't provide new information about Bungo's type.\n\n3. **Bungo isn't a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it states that Bungo is not a borogove only if Bungo is a borogove. This is always false. Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\n4. **Zindle isn't a tove.**\n   - As mentioned earlier, Zindle cannot be a rath because a rath galumphed over Zindle. Therefore, Zindle must be either a tove or a borogove. Since we don't have enough information to determine which, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Bungo is a borogove.**\n   - We know every borogove chortled at Bungo, and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo. If Bungo were a borogove, Bungo would have chortled at Bungo, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Bungo cannot be a borogove. This statement is false.\n\n6. **Bungo isn't a borogove.**\n   - As established in the previous point, Bungo cannot be a borogove because Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**6. Bungo isn't a borogove.**",

Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one tove, one borogove, and one rath.\n- A rath is uffish.\n- Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\n- Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the conditional statement\n- \"If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then not all toves chortled at Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\"\n- Since Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo, we can infer that Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin (as the statement is symmetric).\n- Therefore, the conditional statement simplifies to: \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\"\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the implications\n- If every rath chortled at Bungo, then not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n- If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then every rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the truth of each statement\n\n1. **Zindle and Rafin are uffish.**\n   - We know a rath is uffish, but we don't have information about whether Zindle or Rafin is a rath.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n2. **A rath is uffish and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know a rath is uffish (true).\n   - We also know Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo (true).\n   - This statement is true.\n\n3. **Zindle is uffish.**\n   - We don't have information about whether Zindle is a rath.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n4. **Zindle and Bungo are uffish.**\n   - We don't have information about whether Zindle or Bungo is a rath.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n5. **Bungo is uffish if and only if no raths chortled at Rafin.**\n   - We know Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo, but we don't have information about whether Bungo is a rath.\n   - We also don't have information about whether any raths chortled at Rafin.\n   - This statement cannot be determined as true based on the given information.\n\n6. **A rath is uffish but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - We know a rath is uffish (true).\n   - We also know Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo (true).\n   - The statement \"it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" is false.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n**2. A rath is uffish and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.**",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No raths chortled at every tove.\n3. Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n4. If not all toves are beamish, then Zindle isn't a borogove.\n5. If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n6. Only borogoves are beamish and Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Condition 1**: Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n   - This means we have at least one tove, one borogove, and one rath.\n\n2. **Condition 2**: No raths chortled at every tove.\n   - This implies that there is at least one tove that no rath chortled at.\n\n3. **Condition 3**: Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n   - Zindle and Bungo do not engage in self-directed actions (snicker-snacking or chortling).\n\n4. **Condition 4**: If not all toves are beamish, then Zindle isn't a borogove.\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg (\\text{all toves are beamish}) \\rightarrow \\neg (\\text{Zindle is a borogove}) \\).\n   - The contrapositive is: \\( \\text{Zindle is a borogove} \\rightarrow \\text{all toves are beamish} \\).\n\n5. **Condition 5**: If Rafin didn't snicker-snack Rafin, then every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo.\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg (\\text{Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin}) \\rightarrow (\\forall \\text{rath } R, R \\text{ snicker-snacked Bungo} \\rightarrow \\exists \\text{borogove } B, B \\text{ snicker-snacked Bungo}) \\).\n\n6. **Condition 6**: Only borogoves are beamish and Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\n   - This confirms that being beamish is an exclusive property of borogoves and reiterates that Bungo did not snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From Condition 6, we know that only borogoves are beamish.\n- From Condition 3, Bungo did not chortle at Bungo.\n- From Condition 4, if Zindle is a borogove, then all toves are beamish. Since only borogoves are beamish, this implies that Zindle cannot be a tove or a rath if he is a borogove.\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n\n1. **Not all borogoves are beamish and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - False because only borogoves are beamish (Condition 6) and Bungo did not chortle at Bungo (Condition 3).\n\n2. **Not all borogoves are beamish and Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - False because only borogoves are beamish (Condition 6).\n\n3. **Not all borogoves are beamish but it is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.**\n   - False because only borogoves are beamish (Condition 6) and Bungo did not chortle at Bungo (Condition 3).\n\n4. **Not all borogoves are beamish but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - False because only borogoves are beamish (Condition 6).\n\n5. **Only borogoves are beamish but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - True because only borogoves are beamish (Condition 6) and Bungo did not chortle at Bungo (Condition 3).\n\n6. **Only borogoves are beamish and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - False because Bungo did not chortle at Bungo (Condition 3).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5.

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. **Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means we have at least one tove, one borogove, and one rath.\n\n2. **Every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it.**\n   - This implies a mutual galumphing relationship between toves and borogoves. If a tove \\( T \\) galumphed over a borogove \\( B \\), then \\( B \\) must have galumphed over \\( T \\).\n\n3. **Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin unless only toves gyred.**\n   - This means if Zindle chortled at Rafin, then only toves gyred. If any other type (borogove or rath) gyled, Zindle did not chortle at Rafin.\n\n4. **If every rath galumphed over Rafin, then every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. If all raths galumphed over Rafin, then all raths also chortled at Rafin.\n\n5. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - At least one borogove chortled at Rafin, and there is at least one tove that did not snicker-snack Zindle.\n\n6. **Every rath gyred and a rath galumphed over Zindle.**\n   - All raths gyred, and at least one rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Analyzing Each Statement:\n\n1. **No toves galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is no single tove that galumphed over all borogoves. However, from the given information, we know that every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it. This does not necessarily mean that no tove galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is a single tove that all borogoves galumphed over. The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A tove galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - From the given information, we know that every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it. This implies that there is at least one tove that galumphed over a borogove. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Every tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - This statement suggests that each tove galumphed over all borogoves. The given information only states that every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it, which does not imply that every tove galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **A tove galumphed over every borogove.**\n   - This statement suggests that there is a single tove that galumphed over all borogoves. The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **No toves galumphed over a borogove.**\n   - This statement contradicts the given information, which states that every tove galumphed over a borogove that galumphed over it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3. A tove galumphed over a borogove.**",

Every borogove chortled at Bungo or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n4. Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n5. Not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"A borogove chortled at a rath that chortled at it.\"\n- This implies a mutual chortling between a borogove and a rath. Let's denote the borogove as \\( B \\) and the rath as \\( R \\). So, \\( B \\) chortled at \\( R \\) and \\( R \\) chortled at \\( B \\).\n\n#### Statement 3: \"Every borogove chortled at Bungo or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n- This is a disjunction: either every borogove chortled at Bungo, or every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\"\n- This means that there is at least one tove that did not snicker-snack Zindle.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle.\"\n- This means that there is at least one tove that did not galumph over Zindle.\n\n### Combining Statements 3, 4, and 5:\n- Since not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle (Statement 4), the second part of the disjunction in Statement 3 cannot be true. Therefore, the first part must be true: every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n1. **Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is false because we have established that every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n2. **Bungo chortled at a borogove.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Bungo chortled at a borogove. The given information only tells us that every borogove chortled at Bungo, not the other way around.\n\n3. **Bungo isn't a borogove if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is a biconditional statement. If Bungo is not a borogove, then a borogove chortled at Bungo. However, since every borogove chortled at Bungo, this statement is true regardless of whether Bungo is a borogove or not. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **No borogoves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is false because we have established that every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\n5. **Every borogove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This is true based on our analysis.\n\n6. **Bungo chortled at every borogove.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Bungo chortled at every borogove. The given information only tells us that every borogove chortled at Bungo, not the other way around.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **3.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n3. It is not the case that Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle.\n4. Rafin isn't a tove.\n5. A borogove will whiffle.\n6. Every rath will whiffle or Rafin is a tove.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine Rafin's Type\n- From statement 4, Rafin isn't a tove.\n- From statement 6, \"Every rath will whiffle or Rafin is a tove.\" Since Rafin isn't a tove, it must be true that every rath will whiffle.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the Whiffle Condition for Raths\n- From the analysis above, we know that every rath will whiffle.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the Whiffle Condition for Borogoves\n- From statement 5, a borogove will whiffle.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the Chortle Condition for Toves\n- From statement 2, not all toves chortled at Bungo. This means there is at least one tove that did not chortle at Bungo.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the Galumph Condition for Rafin\n- From statement 3, it is not the case that Rafin didn't galumph over Zindle. This means Rafin did galumph over Zindle.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n\n1. **Only raths will whiffle.**\n   - False. Borogoves will also whiffle.\n\n2. **No raths will whiffle.**\n   - False. Every rath will whiffle.\n\n3. **Every rath will whiffle.**\n   - True. We determined this from the given information.\n\n4. **Not all raths will whiffle.**\n   - False. Every rath will whiffle.\n\n5. **Not all toves will whiffle and every tove will whiffle.**\n   - This statement is contradictory. It cannot be true because it asserts both that not all toves will whiffle and that every tove will whiffle, which are mutually exclusive.\n\n6. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Zindle will whiffle. The type of Zindle (tove, borogove, or rath) is not specified, and we only know the whiffle conditions for raths and borogoves.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3.

It means that the two conditions are either both true or both false.\n- Let's denote:\n  - \\( P \\): Not all borogoves galumphed over Zindle.\n  - \\( Q \\): Not all borogoves chortled at Bungo.\n- The statement can be written as \\( P \\leftrightarrow Q \\).\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **No borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every borogove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Only borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This is consistent with the given information that every borogove will whiffle. However, we need to check if other entities (toves or raths) might also whiffle. Since the problem does not provide information about toves or raths whiffing, we cannot definitively say that only borogoves will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Only borogoves will whiffle and no borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This is a contradiction. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Only borogoves will whiffle and not all borogoves will whiffle.**\n   - This is a contradiction because if only borogoves will whiffle, then all borogoves must whiffle.

Everything is a tove, a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle.\n3. It is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n4. Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle only if Bungo is a borogove.\n5. A borogove chortled at Rafin.\n6. Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Chortling and Snicker-Snacking Conditions\n- **Zindle didn't snicker-snack Zindle**: This means Zindle is not a rath (since every rath snicker-snacks Zindle).\n- **It is not the case that Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo**: This means Bungo did chortle at Bungo.\n- **Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle only if Bungo is a borogove**: This implies that if Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle, then Bungo must be a borogove. Since Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle, Bungo must be a borogove.\n- **A borogove chortled at Rafin**: This means there is at least one borogove who chortled at Rafin.\n- **Every rath snicker-snacked Zindle**: This confirms that Zindle is not a rath.\n\nFrom the above, we can conclude:\n- Zindle is not a rath.\n- Bungo is a borogove.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Zindle's Type\n- Since Zindle is not a rath, Zindle must be either a tove or a borogove.\n- We need to check if Zindle can be a borogove or a tove.\n\n#### Step 3: Check the Implications of Zindle Being a Borogove\n- If Zindle were a borogove, then Zindle would have chortled at Zindle (since a borogove chortles at itself). However, we know Zindle didn't chortle at Zindle. Therefore, Zindle cannot be a borogove.\n\nSince Zindle cannot be a borogove and is not a rath, Zindle must be a tove.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine Rafin's Type\n- A borogove chortled at Rafin. Since Bungo is a borogove and chortled at Bungo, Bungo could be the borogove who chortled at Rafin.\n- There is no information that directly contradicts Rafin being a borogove, a tove, or a rath. However, since we need to determine which statements must be true, we focus on the given options.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Zindle is a tove** (not a borogove and not a rath).\n- **Rafin's type is not definitively determined** based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n3. Zindle isn't a rath.\n6. Zindle isn't a borogove.",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Zindle is a rath.\n3. Bungo chortled at Rafin.\n4. If not all borogoves are mimsy, then not all toves chortled at Bungo only if Rafin is beamish.\n5. If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Rafin is beamish only if no borogoves are beamish.\n6. Only toves are mimsy but it is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There are three types: toves, borogoves, and raths.\n- Zindle is a rath.\n- Bungo chortled at Rafin.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the conditions involving mimsiness\n- Only toves are mimsy.\n- Bungo is mimsy (since it is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy).\n\nSince only toves are mimsy and Bungo is mimsy, Bungo must be a tove.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the conditional statements\n- If not all borogoves are mimsy, then not all toves chortled at Bungo only if Rafin is beamish.\n- If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Rafin is beamish only if no borogoves are beamish.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P \\): Not all borogoves are mimsy.\n- \\( Q \\): Not all toves chortled at Bungo.\n- \\( R \\): Rafin is beamish.\n- \\( S \\): No borogoves are beamish.\n\nThe first conditional statement can be written as:\n\\[ P \\rightarrow (Q \\rightarrow R) \\]\n\nThe second conditional statement can be written as:\n\\[ P \\rightarrow (R \\rightarrow S) \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Simplify the conditions\nFrom the second conditional statement:\n\\[ P \\rightarrow (R \\rightarrow S) \\]\nIf \\( P \\) is true, then \\( R \\rightarrow S \\) must be true. This means if Rafin is beamish, then no borogoves are beamish.\n\nFrom the first conditional statement:\n\\[ P \\rightarrow (Q \\rightarrow R) \\]\nIf \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) must be true. This means if not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Rafin is beamish.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the truth values\n- Since Bungo is a tove and Bungo chortled at Rafin, we need to consider the implications for the other toves.\n- If \\( P \\) is false (all borogoves are mimsy), then the conditional statements do not provide any new information about Rafin being beamish or toves chortling at Bungo.\n- If \\( P \\) is true (not all borogoves are mimsy), then:\n  - \\( R \\rightarrow S \\) must be true.\n  - \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( R \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) are both true, we need to check the consistency:\n- If \\( R \\) is true (Rafin is beamish), then \\( S \\) must be true (no borogoves are beamish).\n- If \\( Q \\) is true (not all toves chortled at Bungo), then \\( R \\) must be true (Rafin is beamish).\n\nHowever, since Bungo is a tove and chortled at Rafin, and Bungo is mimsy, it implies that some toves chortled at Bungo. Therefore, \\( Q \\) (not all toves chortled at Bungo) cannot be true if Bungo chortled at Rafin.\n\nThus, \\( P \\) must be false (all borogoves are mimsy), and the conditional statements do not provide additional constraints.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that Bungo is a tove and chortled at Rafin, and considering the constraints, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**3. A tove chortled at Rafin.**\n\nThis is because Bungo, who is a tove, chortled at Rafin. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**3. A tove chortled at Rafin.**",

A borogove is uffish just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n- From the given information, \"No toves galumphed over Bungo,\" we can directly conclude that not all toves galumphed over Bungo. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A tove galumphed over Bungo.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 3: Zindle is uffish.\n- According to the given information, a borogove is uffish just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle. Since no toves snicker-snacked Zindle (as every borogove snicker-snacked Zindle and there are no toves involved in this action), Zindle is uffish. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every tove galumphed over Bungo.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that \"No toves galumphed over Bungo.\" Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n#### Statement 5: Bungo galumphed over a tove.\n- The given information does not provide any details about Bungo galumphing over anything. We only know that no toves galumphed over Bungo, but nothing about Bungo's actions. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Bungo galumphed over every tove.\n- Similar to Statement 5, the given information does not provide any details about Bungo galumphing over anything. We only know that no toves galumphed over Bungo, but nothing about Bungo's actions. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined as true or false based on the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n3. Zindle is uffish.",

            "raw_response": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, let's break down the given information and analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n3. Every borogove galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.\n4. Every borogove chortled at Bungo or every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n5. If every rath chortled at Rafin, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\n6. A borogove will burble and Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 2: No borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\nThis directly implies that:\n- **Statement 1 (Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove)** cannot be true because if Rafin snicker-snacked a borogove, then that borogove would have snicker-snacked Rafin, which contradicts the given information.\n- **Statement 2 (Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin)** cannot be true for the same reason.\n- **Statement 4 (Rafin snicker-snacked every borogove)** cannot be true for the same reason.\n- **Statement 5 (A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin)** cannot be true for the same reason.\n\nThus, we can eliminate statements 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n\n#### Statement 6: A borogove will burble and Bungo is a rath.\nThis tells us two things:\n- There exists at least one borogove that will burble.\n- Bungo is a rath.\n\n#### Statement 3: Every borogove galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.\nThis means that if a rath galumphed over a borogove, then that borogove galumphed back over the rath.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every borogove chortled at Bungo or every tove galumphed over Rafin.\nThis is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n- Every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n- Every tove galumphed over Rafin.\n\nSince Bungo is a rath, and we know there is at least one borogove, the first condition (every borogove chortled at Bungo) must be true. This is because if it were false, then every tove would have to galumph over Rafin, which is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 5: If every rath chortled at Rafin, then not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\nThis is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n- If every rath chortled at Rafin, then:\n  - Not all toves galumphed over Bungo only if Zindle chortled at Zindle.\n\nWe need to determine if this statement provides any additional information. Since we don't have enough information to determine whether every rath chortled at Rafin, we can't definitively conclude anything from this statement alone.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis, we can see that:\n- Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are false.\n- Statement 3 does not provide a direct answer to the given options.\n- Statement 6 tells us that a borogove will burble, which is a fact but not an option in the list.\n\nThe only remaining statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n- **Statement 3: Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**6.

It is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove (i.e., Rafin is a tove).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Rafin is a tove** (from point 5).\n- **Zindle snicker-snacked Rafin** (from point 2). Since Rafin is a tove, Zindle snicker-snacked a tove.\n- **A tove galumphed over Bungo** (from point 3). This tells us that Bungo is not a tove (since a tove cannot galumph over another tove, as they are exclusive categories).\n- **Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle** (from point 4).

We know Bungo did not snicker-snack Zindle, and we have no information about any other toves snicker-snacking Zindle.\n\n4. **Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - False. We know Bungo did not snicker-snack Zindle, and Bungo is not a tove. However, we have no information about other toves, so we cannot conclude that every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - False. We know Bungo did not snicker-snack Zindle, but we have no information about other toves. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\n\n6. **Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.**\n   - False.

We know from the given information that Rafin chortled at Bungo, and Bungo is a rath.\n\n2. **Every rath chortled at Rafin.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if every rath chortled at Rafin. We only know that Bungo (a rath) chortled at Rafin, but there could be other raths that did not chortle at Rafin.\n\n3. **Not all raths chortled at Rafin.**\n   - This is possible but not necessarily true. We only know that Bungo chortled at Rafin, but we don't have information about other raths.\n\n4. **No raths chortled at Rafin.**\n   - False.

The given information does not provide enough context to determine this.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin are uffish.**\n   - We know Zindle is uffish, but we don't have enough information to determine if Rafin is uffish.\n\n3. **Zindle is uffish but it is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle.**\n   - We know Zindle is uffish, but we also know Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle is uffish and Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle.**\n   - We know both parts of this statement are true. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **Zindle and Bungo are uffish.**\n   - We know Zindle is uffish, but we have no information about Bungo being uffish. Therefore, this statement cannot be determined to be true.\n\n6. **Zindle isn't uffish.**\n   - We know Zindle is uffish, so this statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**4. Zindle is uffish and Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle.**",

No toves galumphed over Zindle or a rath galumphed over Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Rafin isn't uffish** and **Rafin isn't a tove**:\n   - Since Rafin isn't a tove, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n   - Since Rafin isn't uffish, and a borogove is uffish, Rafin cannot be a borogove.\n   - Therefore, Rafin must be a rath.\n\n2. **A rath chortled at Bungo**:\n   - This confirms that there is at least one rath, and this rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n3. **A borogove is uffish and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo**:\n   - Since Rafin is a rath and didn't chortle at Bungo, this is consistent with the information that a rath chortled at Bungo (it wasn't Rafin).\n\n4. **No toves galumphed over Zindle or a rath galumphed over Rafin**:\n   - This means no toves galumphed over Zindle, and no raths (including Rafin) galumphed over Rafin.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **A borogove is uffish and Rafin isn't a tove**:\n   - True. We know a borogove is uffish and Rafin isn't a tove.\n\n2. **A borogove is uffish but it is not the case that Rafin isn't a tove**:\n   - False.

Every tove is uffish or a rath galumphed over Zindle.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every tove galumphed over every borogove.\n- This statement would mean that for every tove \\( T \\) and every borogove \\( B \\), \\( T \\) galumphed over \\( B \\).\n- The given information does not provide any direct evidence that every tove galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: No toves galumphed over every borogove.\n- This statement would mean that there is no tove \\( T \\) such that \\( T \\) galumphed over every borogove \\( B \\).\n- The given information does not provide any direct evidence that no tove galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A tove galumphed over every borogove.\n- This statement would mean that there exists at least one tove \\( T \\) such that \\( T \\) galumphed over every borogove \\( B \\).\n- The given information does not provide any direct evidence that a specific tove galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every tove galumphed over a borogove.\n- This statement would mean that for every tove \\( T \\), there exists at least one borogove \\( B \\) such that \\( T \\) galumphed over \\( B \\).\n- From the given information, we know that every borogove galumphed over every tove. However, this does not imply that every tove galumphed over a borogove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.\n- This statement would mean that there exists at least one tove \\( T \\) such that every borogove \\( B \\) galumphed over \\( T \\).\n- From the given information, we know that every borogove galumphed over every tove.

Therefore, it is possible that a tove galumphed over a borogove, but the given information does not directly confirm this. However, since every borogove galumphed over every tove, it implies that there is at least one tove and one borogove, and thus a tove could have galumphed over a borogove. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n- **Statement 5: There is a tove that every borogove galumphed over.**\n- **Statement 6: A tove galumphed over a borogove.**",

Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n4. **A tove chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This statement suggests that at least one tove chortled at Bungo. Similar to the previous statement, the given information does not provide any information about toves chortling at Bungo. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n5. **No toves chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This statement suggests that no toves chortled at Bungo. Again, the given information does not provide any information about toves chortling at Bungo, so this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n6. **Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo chortled at Bungo.**\n   - This statement combines two parts: \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\" and \"Bungo chortled at Bungo.\"\n   - The first part, \"Not all toves chortled at Bungo,\" is false as explained in the analysis of statement 1.\n   - The second part, \"Bungo chortled at Bungo,\" is not provided in the given information and cannot be concluded.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**2. Bungo chortled at a tove.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Since Bungo chortled at Bungo, Bungo must be a tove (because only toves can chortle).\n\n3. **Not all raths galumphed over Rafin and Rafin chortled at Zindle.**\n   - This implies that some raths did not galumph over Rafin, and Rafin chortled at Zindle. Since Rafin chortled at Zindle, Rafin must be a tove (because only toves can chortle).\n\n4. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and every tove will whiffle.**\n   - This implies that there is at least one borogove who chortled at Rafin, and every tove will whiffle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Bungo is a tove** because Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n- **Rafin is a tove** because Rafin chortled at Zindle.\n- **Every tove will whiffle** as stated directly.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle.**\n   - We know Rafin is a tove and every tove will whiffle, so Rafin will whiffle. However, we do not have enough information to determine if Zindle is a tove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Only toves will whiffle.**\n   - We know every tove will whiffle, but we do not have information about whether borogoves or raths will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Zindle will whiffle.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine if Zindle is a tove. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Not all toves will whiffle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every tove will whiffle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **No toves will whiffle.**\n   - This contradicts the given information that every tove will whiffle.

Let's break it down:\n    - If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then:\n      - Every rath snicker-snacked Bungo only if Bungo didn't snicker-snack Bungo.\n    - Since Bungo is a borogove, Bungo cannot snicker-snack Bungo (as it would create a contradiction).\n    - Therefore, if a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, every rath must snicker-snack Bungo.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n1. **A tove chortled at every borogove.**\n   - False.

If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n4. Only borogoves are beamish but it is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There are three types of entities: toves, borogoves, and raths.\n- Each entity is exclusively one of these types.\n- There is at least one tove, one borogove, and one rath.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the beamish property\n- Bungo or Rafin are beamish.\n- Only borogoves are beamish.\n- It is not the case that Bungo isn't mimsy, which means Bungo is mimsy.\n\nFrom the above, we can conclude:\n- Since only borogoves are beamish, Bungo must be a borogove.\n- Since Bungo is mimsy, Bungo is a mimsy borogove.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the conditional statement\n- If not all borogoves are mimsy, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\nLet's break this down:\n- Let \\( P \\) be \"Not all borogoves are mimsy.\"\n- Let \\( Q \\) be \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle.\"\n- Let \\( R \\) be \"Every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n\nThe statement can be written as:\n\\[ P \\rightarrow (Q \\rightarrow R) \\]\n\nThis means:\n- If \\( P \\) is true (not all borogoves are mimsy), then \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) must be true.\n- If \\( P \\) is false (all borogoves are mimsy), then the implication \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) is vacuously true regardless of the truth values of \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\).\n\nSince Bungo is a mimsy borogove, and we know that Bungo is beamish (and thus a borogove), we need to consider the implications:\n- If all borogoves are mimsy, then \\( P \\) is false, and the implication \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) is vacuously true.\n- If not all borogoves are mimsy, then \\( P \\) is true, and we need to check \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\).\n\nHowever, since Bungo is mimsy, and we have no information about other borogoves being mimsy or not, we cannot definitively determine whether \\( P \\) is true or false without additional information.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the statements\n1. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - We have no information about Zindle's properties, so this cannot be determined.\n\n2. **Every borogove is beamish.**\n   - This is true because only borogoves are beamish.\n\n3. **No borogoves are beamish.**\n   - This is false because only borogoves are beamish, and Bungo is a beamish borogove.\n\n4. **Not all borogoves are mimsy.**\n   - We cannot determine this with the given information. Bungo is mimsy, but we don't know about other borogoves.\n\n5. **Only borogoves are beamish and not all borogoves are beamish.**\n   - This is false because if only borogoves are beamish, and Bungo is a beamish borogove, it does not necessarily mean that not all borogoves are beamish.\n\n6. **A borogove is beamish.**\n   - This is true because Bungo is a beamish borogove.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **2. Every borogove is beamish.**\n- **6. A borogove is beamish.**",

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. A tove snicker-snacked Zindle.\n3. There is a rath that every tove chortled at.\n4. A rath chortled at Zindle only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\n5. If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 3: \"There is a rath that every tove chortled at.\"\nThis statement directly tells us that there exists at least one rath that every tove chortled at. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n#### Statement 4: \"A rath chortled at Zindle only if Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\nThis implies that for a rath to chortle at Zindle, Rafin must have snicker-snacked Rafin. However, we don't have any information about whether Rafin snicker-snacked Rafin, so we cannot determine if any rath chortled at Zindle based on this alone.\n\n#### Statement 5: \"If not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Bungo galumphed over Zindle only if not all toves galumphed over Bungo.\"\nThis is a conditional statement. It tells us that if not all toves chortled at Bungo, then Bungo galumphing over Zindle depends on whether not all toves galumphed over Bungo. This statement is complex and doesn't directly help us with the chortling relationships between toves and raths.\n\n### Evaluating the Statements:\n\n1. **A tove chortled at a rath.**\n   - From Statement 3, we know there is a rath that every tove chortled at. Therefore, at least one tove chortled at this rath. This statement must be true.\n\n2. **No toves chortled at every rath.**\n   - This statement contradicts Statement 3, which states that there is a rath that every tove chortled at. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n3. **There is a tove that every rath chortled at.**\n   - We have no information that directly supports or refutes this statement. The given information does not provide enough details to determine if there is a tove that every rath chortled at.\n\n4. **No toves chortled at a rath.**\n   - This statement contradicts Statement 3, which states that there is a rath that every tove chortled at. Therefore, this statement must be false.\n\n5. **Every tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - Statement 3 only tells us that there is at least one rath that every tove chortled at, not that every tove chortled at every rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n6. **A tove chortled at every rath.**\n   - Similar to Statement 3, we know there is a rath that every tove chortled at, but we do not have information to conclude that there is a tove that chortled at every rath. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**1. A tove chortled at a rath.**",

It means that for a borogove to chortle at Zindle, every rath must snicker-snack Bungo.\n\nLet's consider the implications:\n- If every rath snicker-snacks Bungo, then a borogove must chortle at Zindle.\n- If a borogove does not chortle at Zindle, then not every rath snicker-snacks Bungo.\n\n#### Step 3: Determining Zindle's Identity\n- We need to determine if Zindle can be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n- If Zindle were a tove, then a tove would chortle at Zindle, which contradicts the fact that no toves chortle at anyone who is not a tove. Therefore, Zindle cannot be a tove.\n\nSo, Zindle must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n#### Step 4: Verifying the Statements\n1. **Zindle is a tove:** False, as established.\n2. **Rafin isn't a tove:** True, as established.\n3. **Zindle isn't a tove:** True, as established.\n4. **Rafin is a tove:** False, as established.\n5. **Bungo is a tove:** False, as established.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **2. Rafin isn't a tove.**\n- **3. Zindle isn't a tove.**",

Rafin isn't beamish.\n6. Bungo is a rath.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Bungo is a rath.**\n   - This means Bungo is one of the raths that Bungo galumphed over.\n\n2. **Bungo galumphed over every rath.**\n   - Since Bungo is a rath, Bungo must have galumphed over Bungo.\n\n3. **If Zindle is mimsy, then Bungo will burble.**\n   - We need to determine if Bungo will burble to understand the implications for Zindle.\n\n4. **Rafin isn't beamish.**\n   - This information doesn't directly affect the other statements, so we'll keep it in mind but focus on the more relevant information.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Bungo didn't galumph over Bungo.**\n   - False. Since Bungo is a rath and Bungo galumphed over every rath, Bungo must have galumphed over Bungo.\n\n2. **Zindle won't burble.**\n   - We need to consider the condition: If Zindle is mimsy, then Bungo will burble. Since Bungo is a rath and Bungo galumphed over Bungo, Bungo will burble regardless of whether Zindle is mimsy or not. Therefore, Zindle might burble if Zindle is mimsy, but we can't definitively say Zindle won't burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Bungo galumphed over Bungo.**\n   - True. As established, Bungo is a rath and Bungo galumphed over every rath, including Bungo.\n\n4. **Zindle and Rafin will burble.**\n   - We don't have enough information to determine if Rafin will burble. We only know that if Zindle is mimsy, Bungo will burble, but this doesn't provide information about Rafin. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Zindle will burble.**\n   - We need to consider the condition: If Zindle is mimsy, then Bungo will burble. Since Bungo is a rath and Bungo galumphed over Bungo, Bungo will burble regardless of whether Zindle is mimsy or not. Therefore, Zindle might burble if Zindle is mimsy, but we can't definitively say Zindle will burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Zindle and Bungo will burble.**\n   - Bungo will burble because Bungo is a rath and Bungo galumphed over Bungo. However, we can't definitively say Zindle will burble. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n3. Bungo galumphed over Bungo.",

The information given states that a tove galumphed over every borogove, but it does not specify that there is a single tove that did this for all borogoves. It could be different toves galumphing over different borogoves.\n\n#### Statement 2: No toves galumphed over every borogove.\n- This statement is false because the information given explicitly states that a tove galumphed over every borogove. Therefore, there must be at least one tove that galumphed over every borogove.\n\n#### Statement 3: A tove galumphed over a borogove.\n- This statement is true. Since a tove galumphed over every borogove, it follows that a tove galumphed over at least one borogove.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every tove galumphed over a borogove.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The information given only states that a tove galumphed over every borogove, not that every tove did so. It could be that only one tove galumphed over all borogoves.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every tove galumphed over every borogove.\n- This statement is false. The information given only states that a tove galumphed over every borogove, not that every tove did so.

It is not the case that Bungo didn't snicker-snack Zindle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: \"A tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\"\n- This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. We know that every tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked every borogove, but this does not directly imply that a tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"A tove snicker-snacked every borogove.\"\n- This statement is also not necessarily true. The information given does not specify that every tove snicker-snacked every borogove, only that every tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked every borogove.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"No toves snicker-snacked every borogove.\"\n- This statement is not necessarily true.

If no toves snicker-snacked a borogove, then the condition that every tove snicker-snacked every tove that snicker-snacked every borogove would be impossible to satisfy, as there would be no toves that snicker-snacked every borogove.\n\n#### Statement 6: \"Every tove snicker-snacked a borogove.\"\n- This statement is not necessarily true.

Bungo isn't mimsy.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n1. **Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle just in case no toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - This statement is a logical tautology. It means that if not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle, then it must be the case that no toves snicker-snacked Zindle. However, we know from the given information that \"Zindle snicker-snacked every tove,\" which implies that every tove did snicker-snack Zindle. Therefore, this statement cannot be true because it contradicts the given information.\n\n2. **Zindle is mimsy.**\n   - The given information states that \"Bungo isn't mimsy.\" There is no information about whether Zindle is mimsy or not. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of this statement based on the given information.\n\n3. **Every tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - The given information states that \"Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.\" This does not imply that every tove snicker-snacked Zindle. Instead, it means that Zindle performed the action of snicker-snacking on every tove. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Zindle snicker-snacked a tove.**\n   - The given information states that \"Zindle snicker-snacked every tove.\" Since there is at least one tove, it follows that Zindle snicker-snacked at least one tove. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n5. **No toves snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - The given information states that \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This means that some toves did not snicker-snack Zindle, but it does not mean that no toves snicker-snacked Zindle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n6. **A tove snicker-snacked Zindle.**\n   - The given information states that \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle.\" This means that some toves did snicker-snack Zindle, but not all of them. Therefore, it is possible that at least one tove snicker-snacked Zindle. However, we cannot definitively say that this is true based on the given information alone.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**4.

If Bungo galumphed over Zindle, then every rath is beamish only if no raths galumphed over Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every rath galumphed over a rath.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The given information does not specify that every rath must galumph over another rath. It only states that a rath galumphed over Zindle and that every rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it. There could be a rath that did not galumph over any other rath.\n\n#### Statement 2: No raths galumphed over every rath.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The given information does not provide enough details to conclude that no rath galumphed over every rath. It is possible that a rath galumphed over every rath, but it is not required by the given conditions.\n\n#### Statement 3: A rath galumphed over every rath.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The given information does not specify that a single rath galumphed over every rath. It only states that every rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it, which is a different condition.\n\n#### Statement 4: A rath galumphed over a rath.\n- This statement is true. We know that a rath galumphed over Zindle, and since every rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it, the rath that galumphed over Zindle must have also galumphed over itself. Therefore, a rath galumphed over a rath.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every rath galumphed over every rath.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The given information only states that every rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it, not that every rath galumphed over every rath. There could be raths that did not galumph over each other.\n\n#### Statement 6: A rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.\n- This statement is true. The given information explicitly states that every rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it. Therefore, a rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true in this situation are:\n4. A rath galumphed over a rath.\n6. A rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.",

No toves galumphed over Rafin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the nature of Zindle and Bungo\n- **Zindle or Bungo are uffish**: This means at least one of them is uffish. However, it does not specify which one or if both are uffish.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the action \"galumphed\"\n- **Zindle galumphed over Rafin**: This tells us that Zindle performed an action (galumphing) over Rafin.\n- **No toves galumphed over Rafin**: This means that if Zindle galumphed over Rafin, Zindle cannot be a tove.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine Zindle's type\n- Since no toves galumphed over Rafin and Zindle did galumph over Rafin, Zindle cannot be a tove.\n- Therefore, Zindle must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine Zindle's uffish status\n- **Zindle or Bungo are uffish**: Since Zindle is not a tove, we need to consider the uffish status.\n- If Zindle is uffish, then the statement \"Zindle or Bungo are uffish\" is satisfied.\n- If Zindle is not uffish, then Bungo must be uffish to satisfy the statement \"Zindle or Bungo are uffish\".\n\n### Evaluate the Statements:\n1. **Zindle and Bungo are uffish**: This is not necessarily true because only one of them needs to be uffish.\n2. **Zindle isn't uffish**: This is not necessarily true because Zindle could be uffish.\n3. **Zindle is a tove**: This is false because Zindle cannot be a tove.\n4. **Zindle isn't a tove**: This is true because Zindle cannot be a tove.\n5. **Zindle is uffish**: This is possible but not necessarily true because Bungo could be the uffish one.\n6. **Zindle and Rafin are uffish**: This is not necessarily true because we do not have information about Rafin's uffish status.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true is:\n4.

However, since everything must be one of these three, Zindle must be either a tove or a borogove.\n\n#### Step 2: Apply the rules to Bungo and Zindle\n- Since Bungo is a rath, and every rath chortled at Zindle, it follows that Bungo chortled at Zindle.\n- Zindle is beamish, but we don't have specific information about what being beamish implies in terms of actions like chortling or whiffing.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate each statement\n1. **Zindle and Bungo will whiffle.**\n   - Bungo is a rath, and there is no information that raths will whiffle.\n   - Zindle could be a tove or a borogove.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This statement implies that for every tove, there exists at least one rath that the tove has snicker-snacked.\n- The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. We only know that every rath snicker-snacked a tove, not the other way around. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: No toves snicker-snacked every rath.\n- This statement implies that no tove has snicker-snacked every rath.\n- Since we do not have information about toves snicker-snacking raths, we cannot definitively say this is true. However, it is possible that no tove has snicker-snacked every rath, but it is not a necessary truth based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: A tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This statement implies that there exists at least one tove that has snicker-snacked at least one rath.\n- From the given information, we know that every rath snicker-snacked a tove. This means that for every rath, there is at least one tove that the rath has snicker-snacked. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that there is at least one tove that has been snicker-snacked by a rath, which implies that a tove has snicker-snacked a rath. Thus, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n- This statement implies that for every tove, the tove has snicker-snacked every rath.\n- The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. We only know that every rath snicker-snacked a tove, not the other way around.

Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.\n2. Rafin didn't snicker-snacked Rafin.\n3. A tove chortled at every borogove.\n4. Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin or Rafin is a tove.\n5. Not all raths gimbled just in case every tove snicker-snacked Rafin.\n6. A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine Rafin's Type\n- From statement 6: \"A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.\"\n  - This means Rafin cannot be a tove.\n  - Therefore, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Statement 4\n- Statement 4: \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin or Rafin is a tove.\"\n  - Since Rafin is not a tove (from step 1), the only way for this statement to be true is if \"not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is true.\n  - Therefore, not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Statement 6 Again\n- Statement 6: \"A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin is a tove.\"\n  - We already know Rafin is not a tove.\n  - This implies that a borogove chortled at Rafin.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if Rafin is a Borogove or a Rath\n- If Rafin were a borogove, then a borogove chortling at Rafin would mean a borogove chortled at another borogove.\n- However, we need to check if this conflicts with any other statements.\n- Statement 3: \"A tove chortled at every borogove.\"\n  - This does not conflict with Rafin being a borogove because a tove can still chortle at Rafin (who is a borogove).\n\n- If Rafin were a rath, then a borogove chortling at Rafin would mean a borogove chortled at a rath.\n- This also does not conflict with any other statements.\n\nSince both possibilities (Rafin being a borogove or a rath) do not conflict with the given statements, we need to determine which one is more consistent with the overall logic.\n\n#### Step 5: Final Check\n- If Rafin were a borogove, then the statement \"a borogove chortled at Rafin\" would be consistent.\n- If Rafin were a rath, then the statement \"a borogove chortled at Rafin\" would also be consistent.\n\nHowever, since we have already established that not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin, and we need to find a statement that must be true, we focus on the implications of Rafin being a borogove or a rath.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The statement that must be true is: \"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**3. Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.**",

It only means that if a rath \\( R_1 \\) galumphed over another rath \\( R_2 \\), then \\( R_2 \\) also galumphed over \\( R_1 \\).\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 2: No raths galumphed over every rath.\n- This statement suggests that there is no single rath that galumphed over all other raths.\n- The third piece of information does not provide enough information to conclude this. It only tells us about mutual galumphing between raths, not about a rath galumphing over all others.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: There is a rath that every rath galumphed over.\n- This statement suggests that there is a specific rath that all other raths galumphed over.\n- The third piece of information does not provide enough information to conclude this. It only tells us about mutual galumphing between raths, not about a rath being galumphed over by all others.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 4: No raths galumphed over a rath.\n- This statement suggests that no rath galumphed over any other rath.\n- The third piece of information states that every rath galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it, which directly contradicts this statement.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: A rath galumphed over every rath.\n- This statement suggests that there is a specific rath that galumphed over all other raths.\n- The third piece of information does not provide enough information to conclude this. It only tells us about mutual galumphing between raths, not about a rath galumphing over all others.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every rath galumphed over every rath.\n- This statement suggests that for every pair of raths, one rath galumphed over the other.\n- The third piece of information states that every rath galumphed over a rath that galumphed over it, which implies a mutual relationship but does not necessarily mean that every rath galumphed over every other rath.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that can be definitively concluded as false based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 4: No raths galumphed over a rath.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**No raths galumphed over a rath.**",

A rath galumphed over Zindle unless a rath will burble.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: Every tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This means that for every tove, there exists at least one rath that the tove snicker-snacked.\n- From the given information, we know that every rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked it. However, this does not necessarily mean that every tove snicker-snacked a rath. It only means that if a tove snicker-snacked a rath, then the rath snicker-snacked back.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 2: A tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n- This means that there exists at least one tove that snicker-snacked all raths.\n- The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. We only know that if a rath snicker-snacked a tove, then the tove snicker-snacked back, but this does not imply that a single tove snicker-snacked all raths.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A tove snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This means that there exists at least one tove that snicker-snacked at least one rath.\n- From the given information, we know that every rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked it. This implies that there must be at least one tove that snicker-snacked a rath, because if no toves snicker-snacked any raths, then no raths could snicker-snack any toves.\n- Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No toves snicker-snacked a rath.\n- This means that no toves snicker-snacked any raths.\n- This directly contradicts the given information that every rath snicker-snacked a tove that snicker-snacked it. If no toves snicker-snacked any raths, then no raths could snicker-snack any toves.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n#### Statement 5: No toves snicker-snacked every rath.\n- This means that there is no tove that snicker-snacked all raths.\n- This is a weaker statement than Statement 2. Since Statement 2 is not necessarily true, it follows that this statement is also not necessarily true.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 6: Every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n- This means that for every tove, it snicker-snacked every rath.\n- The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. We only know that if a rath snicker-snacked a tove, then the tove snicker-snacked back, but this does not imply that every tove snicker-snacked every rath.\n- Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**3.

Every borogove chortled at Zindle.\n5. Every rath galumphed over Rafin.\n6. Rafin isn't a tove.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine Rafin's Type\n- From statement 6, we know that Rafin is not a tove.\n- Since everything is either a tove, a borogove, or a rath, and Rafin is not a tove, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Chortling and Galumphing Conditions\n- From statement 4, every borogove chortled at Zindle.\n- From statement 5, every rath galumphed over Rafin.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the Chortling Condition for Borogoves\n- From statement 2, no borogoves chortled at a borogove that chortled at it. This implies that if a borogove chortles at another borogove, the second borogove cannot chortle back.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine Zindle's Type\n- From statement 4, every borogove chortled at Zindle. This means Zindle cannot be a borogove because if Zindle were a borogove, it would create a contradiction with statement 2 (a borogove chortling at another borogove that chortled back).\n\nTherefore, Zindle cannot be a borogove. Zindle must be either a tove or a rath.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine Rafin's Type\n- If Rafin were a borogove, then from statement 4, Rafin would have chortled at Zindle. However, from statement 3, no toves chortled at Rafin, which means Rafin cannot be a tove. Since Rafin is not a tove and cannot be a borogove (because it would create a contradiction with statement 3), Rafin must be a rath.\n\n#### Step 6: Verify the Galumphing Condition\n- From statement 5, every rath galumphed over Rafin. Since Rafin is a rath, this condition is satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Zindle cannot be a borogove (from the analysis of chortling conditions).\n- Rafin is a rath (from the elimination process and the galumphing condition).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Zindle isn't a borogove.** (True)\n2. **Rafin is a tove.** (False)\n3. **Zindle is a borogove.** (False)\n4. **Zindle isn't a tove.** (Cannot be determined definitively, but it is possible since Zindle could be a rath)\n5. **Zindle is a tove.** (Cannot be determined definitively, but it is possible)\n\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**1. Zindle isn't a borogove.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**1. Zindle isn't a borogove.**",

Zindle isn't beamish but it is not the case that Rafin gyred.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the type of Bungo\n- From statement 3, Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo.\n- From statement 2, every tove chortled at Bungo.\n- Therefore, Bungo cannot be a tove because if Bungo were a tove, Bungo would have chortled at Bungo, which contradicts statement 3.\n- Thus, Bungo must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the type of Rafin\n- From statement 7, Rafin did not gyre.\n- From statement 4, only borogoves gyre.\n- Therefore, Rafin cannot be a borogove.\n- Thus, Rafin must be either a tove or a rath.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the implications of Rafin being a tove or a rath\n- If Rafin is a tove, then from statement 2, Rafin chortled at Bungo.\n- If Rafin is a rath, then Rafin did not chortle at Bungo (since only toves chortle at Bungo).\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the statement about toves and Rafin\n- Statement 5: Not all toves chortled at Rafin only if not all toves are beamish.\n- If all toves chortled at Rafin, then all toves must be beamish.\n- If not all toves chortled at Rafin, then not all toves are beamish.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the statement about raths and Bungo\n- Statement 6: If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if Rafin is beamish.\n- If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, and a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin must be beamish.\n- If every rath snicker-snacked Bungo, and no borogove snicker-snacked Bungo, then Rafin can be either beamish or not beamish.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine the type of Zindle\n- From statement 7, Zindle is not beamish.\n- Zindle can be a tove, a borogove, or a rath.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n1. **Bungo isn't a tove.**\n   - True, as established in Step 1.\n\n2. **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n   - False, because Rafin did not gyre (statement 7).\n\n3. **Zindle gyred.**\n   - False, because Zindle is not beamish and only borogoves gyre (statement 4).\n\n4. **Bungo is a tove.**\n   - False, as established in Step 1.\n\n5. **Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n   - False, because neither Zindle nor Bungo gyred (Zindle is not beamish and Bungo is not a borogove).\n\n6. **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n   - True, as established in Step 6.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n1. Bungo isn't a tove.\n6. Zindle didn't gyre.",

A rath is beamish but it is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the types of entities\n- There is at least one tove, one borogove, and one rath.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the behavior of raths\n- Every rath chortled at Bungo.\n- A rath is beamish.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the conditional statement involving Rafin\n- If a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath chortled at Rafin only if Rafin is beamish.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the statement about Bungo\n- It is not the case that Bungo chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Evaluate Each Statement:\n\n1. **Bungo is beamish.**\n   - We know that a rath is beamish and every rath chortled at Bungo. However, we don't have enough information to conclude that Bungo is beamish. Bungo could be a tove or a borogove, and we don't know their beamish status.\n\n2. **Rafin is beamish.**\n   - The conditional statement tells us that if a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then every rath chortled at Rafin only if Rafin is beamish. This means that if Rafin is chortled at by every rath, Rafin must be beamish. However, we don't know if a borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, so we can't definitively say Rafin is beamish.\n\n3. **Bungo is a rath.**\n   - We know that every rath chortled at Bungo, but we also know that Bungo did not chortle at Bungo. This implies that Bungo cannot be a rath because a rath would chortle at itself. Therefore, Bungo cannot be a rath.\n\n4. **Rafin and Bungo are beamish.**\n   - From the previous analysis, we cannot definitively say that Bungo is beamish, and we cannot definitively say that Rafin is beamish without additional information. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Bungo isn't a rath.**\n   - As established in the analysis of statement 3, Bungo cannot be a rath because a rath would chortle at itself, and Bungo did not chortle at Bungo. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n6. **Rafin isn't beamish.**\n   - We do not have enough information to determine whether Rafin is beamish or not. The conditional statement provides a condition under which Rafin would be beamish, but we don't know if that condition is met. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement that must be true in this situation is:\n\n**5. Bungo isn't a rath.**",

If Zindle didn't chortle at Rafin, then a borogove snicker-snacked Bungo only if every rath chortled at Bungo.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Statement 1: A borogove chortled at a rath.\n- From statement 3, we know there is a rath that every borogove chortled at. This directly implies that at least one borogove chortled at a rath.\n- Therefore, statement 1 must be true.\n\n#### Statement 2: There is a borogove that every rath chortled at.\n- We need to determine if there is a specific borogove that every rath chortled at.\n- Statement 3 tells us that there is a rath that every borogove chortled at, but it does not provide information about whether there is a borogove that every rath chortled at.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that statement 2 is true based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 3: No borogoves chortled at every rath.\n- This statement is the negation of statement 2. Since we cannot definitively conclude that statement 2 is true, we also cannot definitively conclude that statement 3 is true.\n- Therefore, statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 4: Every borogove chortled at every rath.\n- This statement is stronger than statement 2. It requires that every borogove chortled at every rath.\n- Statement 3 only tells us that there is a rath that every borogove chortled at, not that every borogove chortled at every rath.\n- Therefore, statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n#### Statement 5: No borogoves chortled at a rath.\n- This statement contradicts statement 1, which we have already determined to be true.\n- Therefore, statement 5 must be false.\n\n#### Statement 6: A borogove chortled at every rath.\n- This statement is the same as statement 2, which we have already determined cannot be definitively concluded from the given information.\n- Therefore, statement 6 is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**1. A borogove chortled at a rath.**",

Not all borogoves will whiffle and every tove will whiffle.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **No toves chortled at Rafin and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo:**\n   - This means that Rafin did not chortle at Bungo.\n   - Toves do not chortle at Rafin.\n\n2. **If every rath chortled at Rafin, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo:**\n   - Let's denote:\n     - \\( R \\) as \"every rath chortled at Rafin\"\n     - \\( Z \\) as \"Zindle chortled at Zindle\"\n     - \\( B \\) as \"every borogove chortled at Bungo\"\n   - The statement can be written as: \\( R \\rightarrow (Z \\rightarrow B) \\)\n   - This can be simplified using logical equivalence: \\( R \\rightarrow (Z \\rightarrow B) \\equiv (R \\land Z) \\rightarrow B \\)\n\n3. **Not all borogoves will whiffle and every tove will whiffle:**\n   - This means that there is at least one borogove that will not whiffle.\n   - Every tove will whiffle.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Rafin will whiffle or every borogove chortled at Bungo:**\n   - Since Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo, we need to check if Rafin will whiffle.\n   - We don't have direct information about Rafin's whiffle status, but we know that not all borogoves will whiffle.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information to determine Rafin's whiffle status.\n\n2. **Not all borogoves will whiffle but it is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo:**\n   - We know that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false because it contradicts the given information.\n\n3. **Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo and a borogove will whiffle:**\n   - We know that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n   - We also know that not all borogoves will whiffle, which implies that at least one borogove will whiffle.\n   - This statement is true.\n\n4. **Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo and no borogoves will whiffle:**\n   - We know that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n   - However, we know that not all borogoves will whiffle, which means at least one borogove will whiffle.\n   - This statement is false because it contradicts the given information.\n\n5. **Not all borogoves will whiffle and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo:**\n   - We know that not all borogoves will whiffle.\n   - We also know that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo.\n   - This statement is true.\n\n6. **Rafin will whiffle unless every borogove chortled at Bungo:**\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow W \\), where \\( W \\) is \"Rafin will whiffle\".\n   - We know that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo, so \\( B \\) is false.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg B \\) is true.\n   - For the implication \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow W \\) to be true, \\( W \\) must be true.\n   - However, we don't have direct information about Rafin's whiffle status.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true because we don't have enough information to determine Rafin's whiffle status.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements that must be true are:\n- **3.

Only borogoves gimbled.\n6. No raths chortled at Rafin if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo.\n7. Zindle gyred and only toves gimbled.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the types of Bungo, Rafin, and Zindle\n- **Bungo**: Bungo isn't a rath, so Bungo must be either a tove or a borogove.\n- **Rafin**: We need to determine if Rafin can be a tove, borogove, or rath.\n- **Zindle**: Zindle gyred, and only toves gimbled. This means Zindle is a tove.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the chortling conditions\n- **No toves chortled at a tove**: Since Zindle is a tove, no toves chortled at Zindle.\n- **No toves chortled at Rafin**: This means Rafin cannot be a tove (since toves don't chortle at toves).\n\nSince Rafin cannot be a tove, Rafin must be either a borogove or a rath.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the gimbled condition\n- **Only borogoves gimbled**: This means if anyone gimbled, they must be a borogove.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the chortling condition involving Bungo and Rafin\n- **No raths chortled at Rafin if and only if a borogove chortled at Bungo**:\n  - If a borogove chortled at Bungo, then no raths chortled at Rafin.\n  - If no raths chortled at Rafin, then a borogove chortled at Bungo.\n\nSince Bungo is either a tove or a borogove:\n- If Bungo is a tove, no toves chortled at Bungo (from the given information).\n- If Bungo is a borogove, a borogove could chortle at Bungo.\n\nIf Bungo is a borogove, then a borogove chortled at Bungo, which implies no raths chortled at Rafin. Therefore, Rafin must be a borogove (since raths would chortle at Rafin if Rafin were a rath).\n\nIf Bungo is a tove, no toves chortled at Bungo, and the condition about raths chortling at Rafin doesn't apply. However, since we need at least one of each type, and Bungo being a tove means Rafin must be a borogove to satisfy the \"at least one of each\" condition.\n\nThus, Bungo must be a borogove, and Rafin must be a borogove.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Bungo is a borogove**.\n- **Rafin is a borogove**.\n- **Zindle is a tove**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Rafin gyred**: We don't have information about whether Rafin gyred or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n2. **Zindle gyred and Bungo is a rath**: Zindle did gyre, but Bungo is not a rath. This statement is false.\n3. **Zindle didn't gyre**: Zindle did gyre. This statement is false.\n4. **Zindle gyred but it is not the case that Bungo is a rath**: Zindle did gyre, and Bungo is not a rath. This statement is true.\n5. **Zindle and Bungo gyred**: We don't have information about whether Bungo gyred or not. This statement is not necessarily true.\n6. **Zindle and Rafin gyred**: We don't have information about whether Rafin gyred or not.

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Zindle and Rafin will whiffle**:\n   - We know not all toves will whiffle, and Rafin isn't uffish. Since Rafin isn't uffish, he might or might not whiffle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Rafin chortled at Zindle and Rafin is uffish**:\n   - We know Rafin chortled at Zindle, but Rafin is explicitly stated as not being uffish. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n5. **Rafin chortled at Zindle but it is not the case that Rafin is uffish**:\n   - This statement is true because it aligns with the given information that Rafin chortled at Zindle and Rafin is not uffish.\n\n6. **Zindle will whiffle**:\n   - We know not all toves will whiffle, so it is possible that Zindle will whiffle, but we don't have enough information to definitively say this must be true.

However, we don't have enough information to conclude this. The given information only states that every rath gimbled, but it does not exclude the possibility that toves or borogoves might also gimbled.\n\n#### Statement 2: Not all raths gimbled.\n- This statement contradicts the given information that every rath gimbled. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 3: A rath gimbled.\n- This statement is directly supported by the given information that every rath gimbled. Since there is at least one rath, and every rath gimbled, it follows that a rath gimbled. This statement must be true.\n\n#### Statement 4: No raths gimbled.\n- This statement directly contradicts the given information that every rath gimbled. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n#### Statement 5: Bungo gimbled.\n- The given information does not provide any specific details about Bungo or whether Bungo is a tove, borogove, or rath. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Bungo gimbled based on the given information.\n\n#### Statement 6: Not all raths gimbled if and only if a rath gimbled.\n- This statement is a biconditional (if and only if) statement. For it to be true, both conditions must hold simultaneously:\n  - \"Not all raths gimbled\" must be true.\n  - \"A rath gimbled\" must be true.\n- However, we know from the given information that every rath gimbled, which means \"not all raths gimbled\" is false. Therefore, the entire biconditional statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**Statement 3: A rath gimbled.**\n\nThis is the final answer.",

Zindle gyred and every rath gyred.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Everything is a tove, or a borogove, or a rath (exclusively), and there's at least one of each.**\n   - This means we have at least one tove, one borogove, and one rath.\n\n2. **Zindle or Bungo are mimsy.**\n   - This tells us that either Zindle or Bungo (or both) are mimsy.\n\n3. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Rafin isn't uffish.**\n   - This can be simplified to: A borogove chortled at Rafin and Rafin is uffish.\n\n4. **Zindle gyred and every rath gyred.**\n   - This means Zindle gyred, and all raths gyred.\n\n### Evaluating Each Statement:\n1. **Zindle and Rafin gyred.**\n   - We know Zindle gyred, but we don't have direct information about whether Rafin gyred. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Zindle and Bungo gyred.**\n   - We know Zindle gyred, but we don't have direct information about whether Bungo gyred. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred.**\n   - We know from the given information that a borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n4. **A borogove chortled at Rafin but it is not the case that Zindle gyred.**\n   - We know Zindle gyred, so this statement is false.\n\n5. **Zindle didn't gyre.**\n   - We know Zindle gyred, so this statement is false.\n\n6. **Rafin gyred.**\n   - We don't have direct information about whether Rafin gyred. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only statement that must be true based on the given information is:\n\n**3. A borogove chortled at Rafin and Zindle gyred.**",
