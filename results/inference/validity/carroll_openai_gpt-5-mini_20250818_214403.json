A rath snicker-snacked Zindle: \u2203x(Rath(x) \u2227 S(x,Zindle)). This follows because \u2203x Rath(x) and \u2200x(Rath(x) \u2192 S(x,Zindle)) together entail such an x. So (1) must be true.\n\n2. Zindle snicker-snacked every rath: \u2200x(Rath(x) \u2192 S(Zindle,x)). The premises give S(x,Zindle) for raths, not S(Zindle,x). So (2) need not be true.\n\n3. Zindle snicker-snacked a rath: \u2203x(Rath(x) \u2227 S(Zindle,x)). We only know S(Zindle,Zindle) and we do not know Zindle is a rath, so (3) need not be true.\n\n4. Not all raths snicker-snacked Zindle: \u00ac\u2200x(Rath(x) \u2192 S(x,Zindle)). This contradicts the premise \u2200x(Rath(x) \u2192 S(x,Zindle)), so (4) is false.\n\n5. Zindle didn't snicker-snacked Zindle and a rath snicker-snacked Zindle: \u00acS(Zindle,Zindle) \u2227 \u2203x(Rath(x) \u2227 S(x,Zindle)). The first conjunct is false (we have S(Zindle,Zindle)), so (5) is false.\n\n6. No raths snicker-snacked Zindle: \u2200x(Rath(x) \u2192 \u00acS(x,Zindle)). This contradicts the premise that every rath snicker-snacked Zindle, so (6) is false.\n\nFinal answer: Only statement 1 must be true; statements 2\u20136 need not be true (4,5,6 are actually contradicted by the premises).",

So for every x, if x is a tove then x did not chortle at Rafin.\n- Given: Every rath chortled at Zindle, and there is at least one rath. Hence there does exist a rath who chortled at Zindle.\n- Given: It is not the case that Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo, so Rafin did chortle at Bungo.\n- (\"Only borogoves gyred\" is irrelevant to the six target statements.)\n\nEvaluate each candidate:\n1. \"Zindle and Bungo will burble.\" Zindle will, but nothing forces Bungo to burble. So (1) need not be true.\n2. \"A rath chortled at Zindle only if a tove chortled at Rafin.\" That is: (\u2203rath chortling at Zindle) \u2192 (\u2203tove chortling at Rafin). The antecedent is true (there is a rath and every rath chortled at Zindle) but the consequent is false (no toves chortled at Rafin), so the implication fails.

(Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo.)\n- No borogoves are beamish: \u2200x (Bor(x) \u2192 \u00acBeam(x)).\n- (\u2200x (Tove(x) \u2192 C(x,Bungo))) \u2192 (\u2200x (Rath(x) \u2192 C(x,Rafin))).\n\nCheck each statement:\n\n1. \"Zindle didn't chortle at Bungo just in case no borogoves are beamish.\"\n- This is (\u00acC(Zindle,Bungo)) \u2194 (\u2200x (Bor(x) \u2192 \u00acBeam(x))). Both sides are given as premises, so each side is true in every model satisfying the premises; hence the biconditional is true in every such model. Therefore statement 1 must be true.\n\n2. \"Zindle and Rafin are beamish.\"\n- The premises do not force either individual to be beamish. In particular, Zindle could be a borogove, and by the premise no borogoves are beamish that would make Zindle non-beamish. Thus statement 2 need not be true.\n\nCounterexample for 2 (also satisfying all premises): Domain = {Z,B,R} with Zindle = borogove, Bungo = tove, Rafin = rath; set \u00acC(Z,B), no borogove beamish (so Z not beamish). Choose chortling facts so the conditional premise about toves/raths holds. This model satisfies the premises but not statement 2.\n\n3. \"Zindle and Bungo are beamish.\"\n- Same reasoning: Zindle might be a borogove (so not beamish). So statement 3 need not be true. A similar counterexample as for (2) works.\n\n4. \"If no borogoves are beamish, then Zindle chortled at Zindle only if every borogove chortled at Bungo.\"\n- Formal: (\u2200x (Bor(x) \u2192 \u00acBeam(x))) \u2192 (C(Zindle,Zindle) \u2192 \u2200x (Bor(x) \u2192 C",

Also we are told there is at least one tove and at least one borogove.\n\n- Statement 1: \"There is not a borogove that every tove chortled at.\" If there were a borogove y that every tove chortled at, then in particular some tove would chortle at y, contradicting the universal prohibition. Because at least one tove exists, such a y cannot exist. So statement 1 must be true.\n\n- Statement 2: \"Every tove chortled at every borogove.\" This contradicts \"No toves chortled at a borogove,\" so it cannot be true.\n\n- Statement 3: \"Every tove chortled at a borogove.\" This claims each tove chortled at some borogove; again impossible given the prohibition, so it is false.\n\n- Statement 4: \"A tove chortled at a borogove.\" This existential claim contradicts the prohibition, so it is false.\n\n- Statement 5: \"A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble.\" This is a direct contradiction (exists and none), so it cannot be true; it is inconsistent.\n\n- Statement 6: \"A tove chortled at every borogove.\" This too contradicts the prohibition, so it is false.\n\nThus the only statement that must be true is 1.",

Statement 6 (\"No borogoves chortled at a rath\") is therefore false.\n\n- The other statements are not forced by the premises; here are simple countermodels showing they can fail while all premises hold:\n\n  Countermodel for 1 failing (so 1 not forced): Two raths r1,r2 and two borogoves b1,b2; let C(r1,b1), C(b1,r1), C(r2,b2), C(b2,r2) and no other chortles. Each rath has a mutual borogove, but no single borogove chortled at every rath, so (1) \"A borogove chortled at every rath\" can be false.\n\n  Countermodel for 2 failing (so 2 not forced): Two raths r1,r2 and a borogove b; let b chortle at both r1,r2 and each ri chortle at b. Then some borogove does chortle at every rath, so (2) \"No borogoves chortled at every rath\" can be false.\n\n  Countermodel",

In particular, if any borogove is beamish then Zindle is not a borogove.\n\n- \"Only borogoves are beamish\" means anyone who is beamish must be a borogove.

This satisfies all premises and makes 1 true and 6 false.

Example where Bungo does not gimble: same first example (Bungo = borogove and not gimble) satisfies the premises and makes 3 false.

Thus 3 (\"Not all raths galumphed over Bungo\") is true (entailed).\n\n- Nothing in the premises implies that Bungo galumphed over any rath, so 4 and 5 need not be true (they can be false in some models).\n\n- Rafin is known only to be \"not a tove\" (so Rafin is either a borogove or a rath). Since only borogoves are guaranteed to be uffish and Rafin might be a rath, 6 (\"Rafin is uffish\") is not guaranteed.\n\nCounterexample sketch showing 4\u20136 need not hold: take a model with rath r, toves t1,t2, borogove b (all distinct), with G(r,t1) and G(t1,t2), no rath galumphing over Bungo, every borogove uffish, and let Rafin = r.

(Since Zindle is mimsy, this consequent is true.)\n- Rafin is a tove.\n- No borogoves will whiffle.\n\nFrom these, Rafin is both a tove and mimsy, so the existential statement \"A tove is mimsy\" (statement 5) is necessarily true.\n\nWhy the others need not hold:\n1. \"Every tove is mimsy.\" Not forced: we can consistently have some other tove who is not mimsy (the premises do not require all toves to be mimsy).\n2. \"No toves are mimsy.\" Impossible, because Rafin is a tove and mimsy, so 2 is false in every model of the premises.\n3. \"Zindle will whiffle.\" Not forced: Zindle could be a borogove (allowed) and since no borogoves whiffle, Zindle would not whiffle. Nothing forces Zindle to whiffle.\n4. \"Not all toves are mimsy.\" Not forced: it's consistent with the premises that every tove (including Rafin and any others) is mimsy, so 4 need not be true.\n6. \"Only toves are mimsy.\" Not forced: Zindle (who is mimsy) could be a rath or a borogove, so there could be mimsy individuals who are not toves.\n\nThus the only statement that must be true given the premises is statement 5.",

So for each tove x there is some rath y with Sn(x,y). Since there is at least one tove, \u2203x\u2203y (T(x) \u2227 R(y) \u2227 Sn(x,y)). That exactly makes statement 1 true in every model satisfying the premises.\n\nThe other statements need not hold; simple counterexample models show they are not forced:\n- Take domain = {t, b, r1, r2} with T(t), B(b), R(r1), R(r2). Let chortled(t,b) hold. Let Sn(t,r1) and Sn(r1,t) hold, but no other Sn pairs among toves and raths. Make the galumph premise vacuously irrelevant by letting \"Bungo galumphed over Zindle\" be false. This satisfies all given premises.\n  - Statement 2 (\"No toves snicker-snacked a rath\") is false (t snickered r1).\n  - Statement 3 (\"Every tove snicker-snacked every rath\") is false (t did not snicker r2).\n  - Statement 4 (\"There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked\") is false (r2 does not snicker t).\n  - Statement 5 (\"No toves snicker-snacked every rath\") is false in some models generally (we could also make a model where some tove snicker-snacked every rath), so it is not forced by the premises.\n  - Statement 6 (\"A tove snicker-snacked every rath\") is not forced (false in the model above).\n\nThus only 1 is logically entailed by the premises.",

That makes (5) true in every admissible situation.\n\n- (3) \"No toves snicker-snacked Bungo\" contradicts the fact that Rafin (a tove) did snicker-snack Bungo, so (3) is false.\n\n- The remaining statements ((1), (2), (4), (6)) are not forced by the premises; each can be falsified by a model that satisfies all premises. For example:\n  - To falsify (2) and (4): let the toves be {Rafin, T2} with Rafin snicker-snacking Bungo but T2 not snicker-snacking Bungo; choose the rest of the partition and the Zindle condition so the biconditional about Bungo holds. This satisfies the premises but makes (2) false and (4) true (so (4) is not forced).\n  - To falsify (4): let the only tove be Rafin (who snicker-snacked Bungo); make Bungo a non-borogove and arrange that some tove does not snicker Zindle so the biconditional is satisfied. This satisfies the premises but makes (4) false (so (4) is not forced).\n  - To falsify (1) and (6): use a model where Bungo does not snicker any tove (consistent with all premises); then (1) and (6) are false.\n\nThus only (5) (\"A tove snicker-snacked Bungo\") must be true.",

            "raw_response": "Short answer: Only statement 2 must be true. All the others need not be true.\n\nReasoning (informal but explicit):\n\n- Read the tricky sentence \"A borogove snicker-snacked Rafin only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" as the implication\n  (\u2203b: Borogove(b) \u2227 S(b,Rafin)) \u2192 \u00ac(\u2200b: Borogove(b) \u2192 S(b,Rafin)).\n  That is: if some borogove snicker-snacked Rafin, then it is not the case that every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin.\n\n- This implication rules out the possibility that every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin. If every borogove did snicker-snack Rafin, then the antecedent (some borogove did) would be true while the consequent (not all did) would be false, making the implication false. Since the given situation must satisfy the implication, it cannot be the case that every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin. So statement 4 (\"Every borogove snicker-snacked Rafin\") is impossible, and statement 2 (\"Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\") must be true.\n\n- Nothing in the premises forces that there actually is a borogove who snicker-snacked Rafin (the implication is satisfied if no borogove did), so statement 3 (some borogove snickered Rafin) is not compelled. Similarly, there is no information requiring Rafin to snicker any borogove (statement 1) or to snicker every borogove (statement 6), nor is there any requirement that none snickered (statement 5). All of those can be true or false in different models that satisfy the premises.\n\nExamples to show the non-necessity of the others:\n- Model A (no borogove snickered Rafin): two borogoves b1,b2, one tove t, one rath r; set S = \u2205; choose G(b1,t) and G(t,b2) to satisfy the galumphing sentence. The implication is true (antecedent false), so all premises hold and no borogove snickered Rafin (so statements 1,3,6,4 are false; statement 5 true).\n- Model B (some but not all borogoves snickered Rafin): same domain but set S = {S(b1,Rafin)} with b2 not snickering. Then the implication is true (antecedent true, consequent true), so premises hold and some but not all borogoves snickered Rafin (so statement 3 true, 4 and 6 false).\n\nThus the only statement that must be true in every allowed situation is statement 2.",

Hence no borogove can be mimsy. So the statement \"No borogoves are mimsy\" is true.\n- The sentence \"No borogoves are mimsy only if not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin\" is a conditional of the form (No borogoves are mimsy) \u2192 (Not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin). With the antecedent true, the consequent must be true. Therefore not all borogoves snicker-snacked Rafin.\n- That exactly makes (4) true. None of the other listed statements are forced by the premises:\n  - (6) (every borogove snickered Rafin) contradicts (4), so cannot be true.\n  - (1), (2), (3), (5) are not entailed by the premises (it is consistent with the premises that some borogoves snickered Rafin, or none did, or Rafin did or did not snicker any borogove), so they do not \"must\" be true.\n\nThus only statement 4 must be true.",

Hence C(Bungo,Bungo) (Bungo chortled at Bungo).\n- If G(Bungo,Bungo) then [(every rath chortled at Bungo) only if (no raths galumphed over Bungo)]. (This conditional does not affect whiffling facts.)\n- Not all borogoves will whiffle. Hence there exists a borogove that will not whiffle.\n- Every tove will whiffle.\n\nNow evaluate each option:\n\n1. \"Bungo chortled at Bungo and not all borogoves will whiffle.\" Both conjuncts follow from the premises (C(Bungo,Bungo) and \"not all borogoves will whiffle\"). So 1 must be true.\n\n2. \"Bungo chortled at Bungo and no borogoves will whiffle.\" The first conjunct is true, but the second (no borogoves will whiffle) does not follow; we only know some borogove fails to whiffle, not that all do. So 2 need not be true.\n\n3. \"Bungo chortled at Bungo and only borogoves will whiffle.\" The second conjunct contradicts \"every tove will whiffle\" given there is at least one tove, so 3 is false.\n\n4. \"Bungo didn't chortle at Bungo and a borogove will whiffle.\" The first conjunct contradicts C(Bungo,Bungo), so 4 is false.\n\n5. \"Bungo chortled at Bungo and a borogove will whiffle.\" The first conjunct is true, but the existence of a whiffling borogove is not guaranteed (we only know some borogove does not whiffle). So 5 need not be true.\n\n6. \"Bungo will whiffle.\" This depends on Bungo's type (if Bungo is a tove then yes; otherwise unknown), so 6 does not necessarily follow.\n\nTherefore only statement 1 is entailed by the given information.",

The premises say nothing that requires any tove to chortle at any borogove, so each of (2)\u2013(6) can be true in some models and false in others. For example:\n  - Model A (makes 2\u20136 false or true as needed): universe = {b (borogove), t (tove), r (rath)} with only the required relation chortled(b,t). Take t to chortle at b as well; then (3), (5), (6) are true and (2) is false.\n  - Model B (makes 3\u20136 false): same universe but do not add any chortling from toves to borogoves; then (3), (4), (5), (6) are false and (2) may be true.\n\nThus only statement 1 must hold in every admissible situation.",

So the conjunction \"Zindle isn't mimsy and Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo\" (statement 2) is true in every situation satisfying the premises, hence must be true.\n\nThe other statements do not follow from the premises:\n- Statement 1 asserts not mimsy(Zindle) and chortled(Rafin, Bungo). The second conjunct contradicts a given premise (Rafin didn't chortle at Bungo), so 1 is false.\n- Statements 3, 5, 6 assert that Zindle (and possibly Bungo or Rafin) is mimsy, but the premise explicitly says Zindle isn't mimsy, so any statement claiming Zindle is mimsy (3, 5, 6) is false.\n- Statement 4 (\"Rafin is mimsy\") is not forced by the premises: Rafin could be a tove or a rath (neither of which fixes mimsy), or a borogove whose mimsy-status depends on a global condition about borogoves chortling at Bungo. Thus Rafin may or may not be mimsy in different models consistent with the premises, so 4 does not must be true.\n\nTherefore only",

That requires some rath to have been galumphed over by raths, contradicting the given. So 1 can\u2019t be true.\n\n2\u20134 and 6 all assert that some rath galumphed over a rath (either existentially or universally). Each of these contradicts \u2200x\u2200y[(R(x) \u2227 R(y)) \u2192 \u00acGal(x,y)], so none of 2, 3, 4, 6 must be true.\n\n5. \"A rath galumphed over every rath that galumphed over it.\" Formally \u2203a[R(a) \u2227 \u2200b((R(b) \u2227 Gal(b,a)) \u2192 Gal(a,b))]. Because no rath ever galumphed over any rath, for any fixed rath a the antecedent (R(b) \u2227 Gal(b,a)) is false for every b, so the implication is vacuously true.

Thus there exists a tove that every borogove snicker-snacked \u2014 statement 1 follows directly.\n\nThe other statements need not hold; here are simple countermodels (each model satisfies all given premises but makes the target statement false):\n\nCountermodel showing 2, 4, 5, 6 need not hold (and also shows 3 can hold but is not forced):\n- Domain: {t, b, r} with types Tove(t), Borogove(b), Rath(r).\n- Snicker-snack relation SS: only b SS t (i.e. every borogove SS every tove holds, and no tove ever SS any borogove).\n- Choose Rafin = r and Zindle = r.

So Rafin cannot be a rath. Hence statement 2 (\"Rafin isn't a rath\") must be true; statement 6 (\"Rafin is a rath\") cannot be true.\n\nRafin could be a borogove or a tove. To show the other five statements do not follow, give two example models satisfying all premises:\n- Model A (Rafin is a borogove): Domain {a,b,c} with T(a), B(b) (Rafin = b), R(c). Let G(a,b) true (a tove galumphed over b), let a fail to galumph over b? Actually we must have a tove who does not galumph over Rafin, so pick another tove d \u2014 simpler: Domain {t1,t2, r1, b1} with T(t1), T(t2), B(b1) (Rafin = b1), R(r1). Set G(t1,b1) false, G(t2,b1) true for the \"not all toves\" condition; set G(t2,b1) or G(t2, b1) and ensure G(t, r1) true for both toves. This satisfies all premises with Rafin a borogove.\n- Model B (Rafin is a tove): Domain {t1,t2, b1, r1} with Rafin = t1, T(t1), T(t2), B(b1), R(r1). Let G(t2,t1) false (so not all toves galumphed over Rafin), let G(t2,b1) true (a tove galumphed over a borogove), and let every tove galumph over r1. This satisfies all premises with Rafin a tove.\n\nThus only statement 2 is entailed; statements 1,3,4,5,6 are not guaranteed.",

They say (~Bor(Bungo) \u2192 Bor(Bungo)). Since we have ~Bor(Bungo) and not Bor(Bungo), those implications are false in the actual situation, so they do not have to be true.\n\n- The big conditional about Zindle: \"If Zindle won't burble, then [(not all toves galumphed over Bungo) \u2192 (every rath chortled at Bungo)].\" This does not force Zindle to burble; it only constrains what must hold in the case Zindle does not burble. One can build a model in which Zindle does not burble but the inner implication holds (for example, make all toves galumphed over Bungo, or ensure every rath chortled at Bungo), so (2) is not forced.

(Not all raths galumphed over Bungo.)\n- \u2203 borogove b and rath r such that Snicker(b, r) and Snicker(r, b).\n- \u2203 tove t such that not Snicker(t, Zindle).

(No borogoves will burble.)\n\nNow evaluate each statement:\n\n1. \"Every borogove will burble.\" \u2014 False. Premise says no borogoves will burble, so this contradicts the premises.\n\n2. \"Zindle will burble.\" \u2014 Not forced. Zindle could be a borogove (in which case by the premises Zindle will not burble), or Zindle could be a tove or rath with no information forcing burbling. So this need not be true.\n\n3. \"A borogove will burble.\" \u2014 False. Premise explicitly forbids any borogove from burbling.\n\n4. \"Only borogoves will burble.\" \u2014 Not forced. The premises forbid borogoves from burbling, but say nothing that prevents a tove or rath from burbling; so it is possible that a non-borogove burbles, making this statement false in some models.\n\n5. \"Not all borogoves will burble.\" \u2014 True. Stronger premise says none of the borogoves will burble, so certainly not all will burble. This statement must be true.\n\n6. \"Zindle and Bungo will burble.\" \u2014 Not forced (same reasoning as for 2 and for Bungo: nothing forces either to burble).\n\nConclusion: Only statement 5 must be true; the others need not be true (and 1 and 3 are actually false under the given premises).",

But because no tove snicker-snacked any tove, the antecedent \"y snicker-snacked x\" is always false for tove y; hence the conditional \"if y snicker-snacked x then x snicker-snacked y\" is vacuously true for every y.

Thus \"A tove snicker-snacked Zindle\" (statement 6) is true.\n- The biconditional \"Not all toves snicker-snacked Zindle iff no toves snicker-snacked Zindle\" is consistent with \u2200x (T\u2192S) only if both sides are false; in particular \"Not all...\" (statement 2) and \"No toves...\" (statement 5) are false.\n- The \"unless\" sentence is equivalent to (Zindle gyred) \u2228 \u00ac(Zindle is a borogove). That does not force Zindle to have gyred (Zindle might be non-borogove instead), so statement 4 does not have to be true.\n- Nothing in the premises says Zindle snicker-snacked any tove (the only snicker-snacking facts go the other way), so statements 1",

Counterexamples (models satisfying all premises but violating the statement):\n\n- To falsify 2, 3, 4, 5: let the domain contain exactly T1 (a tove), B1 and B2 (borogoves), and R1 (a rath, let R1 = Bungo). Let the galumph relations be:\n  - T1 galumped R1 (so a tove galumped every rath).\n  - B1 galumped T1 (so a borogove galumped every tove).\n  - B2 did not galump Bungo (so not all borogoves galumped Bungo).\n  - No tove galumped any borogove.\n  This satisfies the premises but makes (2),(3),(4),(5) false.\n\n- To falsify 6: use the same domain but let T1 also galump B1 and B2 (so T1 galumped every borogove). This still meets the premises (with, say, B2 not galumping Bungo) but shows 6 (\"No toves galumphed over every borogove\") can fail.\n\nThus only (1) is logically guaranteed by the premises.",

So \u2203x (rath(x)) and \u2200x (rath(x) \u2192 gyred(x)). Therefore \u2203x (rath(x) \u2227 gyred(x)). That is exactly statement (4). So (4) is necessarily true.\n\n- Statements (1) and (3) contradict the premise \"every rath gyred\":\n  - (1) \"Not all raths gyred\" contradicts \u2200x (rath(x) \u2192 gyred(x)), so (1) cannot be true in any situation satisfying the premises.\n  - (3) \"No raths gyred\" likewise contradicts the same premise.\n\n- Statements (2), (5), (6) are not forced by the premises:\n  - (2) \"Only raths gyred\" would mean no toves or borogoves gyred. Nothing in the premises forbids non-raths from gyreing, so this need not hold. For example, take a model with one rath r (gyred), one tove t (chortled at r) and one borogove b which is also gyred \u2014 this satisfies all premises but falsifies (2).\n  - (5) \"Rafin and Bungo gyred\" need not hold because Rafin and Bungo might be non-raths (or might simply not gyre). For instance, make Rafin a tove and Bungo a borogove and give gyred only to the rath r; that satisfies all premises but falsifies (5).\n  - (6) \"Rafin gyred\" similarly need not hold for the same reasons.\n\nTherefore the only statement that must be true is (4).",

That is exactly statement 5 (\"Not all toves chortled at Rafin\"). So 5 is entailed.\n\nWhy the others need not hold:\n- 1 asserts both \"no toves chortled at Rafin\" (true) and \"Rafin is a tove\" (false, since we are explicitly told Rafin isn't a tove). So 1 is false.\n- 3 (\"Every tove chortled at Rafin\") and 6 (\"A tove chortled at Rafin\") contradict the given \"No toves chortled at Rafin\", so they cannot be true.\n- 2 (\"Rafin chortled at a tove\") and 4 (\"Rafin chortled at every tove\") are not forced by the premises (the premises say nothing that forces Rafin to chortle at toves), so they need not hold.\n\nThus only statement 5 must be true.",

Statements 4 (\"Zindle is a borogove\") and 6 (\"Zindle is uffish\") are therefore false.\n\n- Any statement asserting Zindle is uffish (statements 2, 3, 6) is contradicted by the explicit \u201cnot uffish(Zindle),\u201d so 2, 3, 6 cannot be required.\n\n- Statement 1 (\"Rafin is uffish\") is not forced by the premises. To see this, give a concrete model that satisfies all premises but makes Rafin not uffish:\n\n  Example model:\n  - Domain = {Zindle, Rafin, Bungo",

Instantiating P with \"Every tove chortled at Bungo\" (which is true) yields Q: Rafin didn't chortle at Rafin. So (5) must be true and (6) false.\n- \"Every tove will whiffle\" means all toves whiffle, but nothing forces Zindle, Rafin, or Bungo to be toves (each of those could be a borogove or rath in some admissible models). Thus none of the whiffle claims (1\u20134) is guaranteed: Zindle might whiffle (if Zindle is a tove) or might not (if Zindle is a borogove or rath); similarly for Rafin and Bungo. Therefore 1\u20134 do not necessarily follow.\n\nSo the only statement that must be true is (5).",

Hence there exists a tove who galumphed over Zindle (namely Zindle). Therefore statement 3 (\"A tove galumphed over Zindle\") is necessarily true.\n\n- Statement 2 (\"No toves galumphed over Zindle\") is necessarily false, because it contradicts the given fact that Zindle (a tove) galumphed over Zindle.\n\n- The other statements need not be true in every model consistent with the premises. Here are simple countermodels showing each can be false while satisfying all premises:\n\n  Countermodel for 1 (Zindle is uffish can be false):\n  - Domain: {Z, T, R, B}. Types: Z and T are toves (Z is Zindle), R is a rath, B is a borogove.\n  - Uffish: T is uffish, Z is not.\n  - Galumphing: Z galumphed over Z (given); R galumphed over Z (so a rath galumphed over Z).\n  - This satisfies \"A tove is uffish\" (T), \"Zindle galumphed over Zindle\", and \"Every tove is uffish unless a rath galumphed over Zindle\" (the presence of a rath galumphing makes the universal not forced). Zindle is not uffish, so statement 1 need not hold.\n\n  Countermodel for 4,5,6 (showing they are not forced):\n  - Using the same or similar models, one can arrange whether other toves galumphed over Zindle or not.\n  - Example showing 6 (\"Every tove galumphed over Zindle\") can be false: let there be a tove T who did not galumph Z; keep Z galumphing Z. All premises can still hold, so 6 is not necessary.\n  - Example showing 5 (\"Not all toves galumphed over Zindle\") can be false as well: if the only tove is Zindle (allowed by \"at least one of each\"), then the single tove Z",

The first disjunct is false (see 1) and there is no information forcing G(Rafin,Rafin), so the disjunction need not hold.\n\n4. \"Rafin galumphed over a borogove.\" \u2014 Not entailed.

Hence it is impossible that all toves chortled at Bungo. Therefore 1 (\"Not all toves chortled at Bungo\") must be true.\n\n- 2 (\"Every tove chortled at Bungo\") and 3 (\"A tove chortled at Bungo\") contradict the same premise and so are false.\n\n- 4 (\"Bungo chortled at every tove\") is not entailed by any premise; there are models where Bungo does not chortle at some tove.\n\n- 5 (\"Not all toves chortled at Bungo and Bungo chortled at Bungo\") fails because the second conjunct need not hold (and in some models is false).\n\n- 6 (\"Bungo chortled at a tove\") is not guaranteed by the premises (it can be false in some models).\n\nThus exactly statement 1 must be true.",

All other listed statements need not be true.\n\nReasoning (explicit):\n\n- \"Every rath will whiffle unless every tove is uffish\" is naturally read as: if not(every tove is uffish) then every rath whiffles. Contrapositively: if some rath does not whiffle then every tove is uffish.\n\n- We are told \"Not all raths will whiffle\" (i.e. there exists a rath that does not whiffle). Therefore by the contrapositive above, every tove is uffish. That proves statement 2 must be true.\n\n- From \"Zindle isn't a borogove unless no toves are uffish\" (read: if there exists a tove that is uffish then Zindle isn't a borogove) and the fact that every tove is uffish, we can deduce Zindle is not a borogove \u2014 but this does not force Zindle to whiffle (statement 4) because nothing entails that whichever type Zindle is must whiffle.\n\n- Statement 1 (\"A borogove will burble and no borogoves will burble\") is self-contradictory and therefore cannot be forced true.\n\n- Statement 3 (\"No toves are uffish\") and statement 5 (\"Not all toves are uffish\") both contradict the conclusion that every tove is uffish, so they are false/cannot be forced.\n\n- Statement 6 (\"Only toves are uffish\") asserts that nothing non-tove can be uffish; nothing in the premises requires that, so it need not hold.\n\nThus the only one that must be true is 2.",

            "raw_response": "Answer: Only statement 2 must be true.\n\nReasoning:\n- Given: every tove snicker-snacked every rath. Also there is at least one rath. Therefore every tove snicker-snacked some rath (indeed every rath). So 2 (\"Every tove snicker-snacked a rath\") must be true.\n\n- 3 (\"No toves snicker-snacked every rath\") and 6 (\"No toves snicker-snacked a rath\") contradict the given universal fact and so are false.\n\n- 1 (\"There is a tove that every rath snicker-snacked\"), 4 (\"There is not a tove that every rath snicker-snacked\") and 5 (\"Every rath snicker-snacked every tove\") are not forced by the premises. For example, the following model satisfies the premises but makes 1,4,5 false as appropriate:\n  - Domain = {t (tove), r (rath), b (borogove)}\n  - S(t,r) = true (every tove snicker-snacked every rath),\n    S(r,b) = true and S(b,t) = true (witnessing \"A rath snicker-snacked a borogove that snicker-snacked a tove\"),\n    and S(r,t) = false.\n  In this model 2 holds, but 1 and 5 fail; 4 also fails because 1 is false here but 4 is not entailed in general.\n\nTherefore only statement 2 must be true.",
